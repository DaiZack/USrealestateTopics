<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the U.S., rose 6.4% in April, down from a 6.5% year-over-year increase in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the price gains lost a bit of momentum last month, prices continue to grow faster than both incomes and inflation. Half of the U.S. housing markets are above their 2006 peaks. (Accounting for inflation just three markets are above that peak.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price gains are concentrated in the West. Seattle saw a 13.1% annual gain in April, compared with a year earlier, while Las Vegas prices increased 12.7% and San Francisco saw a 10.9% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One factor pushing prices up is the continued low supply," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>

Lennar Sees 'Solid Fundamentals' Lifting Operations, Housing Market; Company says concerns about rising interest rates and construction costs have been offset by low unemployment and increasing wages</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. said strong demand for new homes and higher selling prices drove earnings growth in the most recent quarter, as the nation's largest home builder reported it has so far shaken off concerns about rising interest rates and construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> executives worked to assure analysts on its earnings call Tuesday that it wasn't seeing declining demand in the market, noting that customers are still able to afford homes and that the U.S. economy and job growth have been good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While there's a lot of focus in the press on rates going up…wage growth is real and it's happening out there," Chief Executive Richard Beckwitt told analysts. "Confidence is solid. So we put all those things together and we don't look at the headlines. We operate our business. And the business is strong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> rose 5% by midafternoon Tuesday after the company reported its latest quarterly results were helped by what Executive Chairman Stuart Miller called "solid fundamentals" in the housing market. The report also helped lift shares in fellow home builders D.R. Horton Inc., <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">NVR Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s results also come after federal data released Monday showed an increase in sales of new homes for the month of May. The Commerce Department said purchases of newly built single-family homes rose 6.7% from a month earlier, or 14.1% from a year ago. Sales of existing homes, however, declined last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported its backlog nearly doubled from a year ago to 19,622, reflecting the more-than 6,000 homes acquired as part of its purchase of <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic</span>, which closed in February. Not including the backlog added from <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic</span>, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s backlog rose 27% to 12,971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price for new orders rose 11% to $418,000 in the three-month period ended May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Concerns about rising interest rates and construction costs have been offset by low unemployment and increasing wages, combined with short supply based on years of underproduction of new homes," <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s Mr. Miller said in prepared remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s second-quarter profit rose 45% to $310.3 million, or 94 cents a share. Excluding costs related to the acquisition and other items, the company made $1.58 a share, beating estimates of 45 cents a share from analysts polled by <span class="companylink">Thomson Reuters</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building revenue rose 75% to $5.06 billion, driven by the <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic</span> purchase. Overall revenue rose 67% to $5.46 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite a U.S. economy that has been in expansion since mid-2009 and had low levels of unemployment, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> forecast home-building activity this year would be below the estimated number of homes needed[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460] to keep up with the rate of population growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More widely, housing market inventory has been tight, driving up home prices and pricing some potential buyers out of the market. Scarce construction labor and rising material costs and mortgage rates are also headwinds for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in May was 4.59%, up more than half a point from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a 5.2-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of May, below the 5.6 level seen at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "supply figures have been mostly below 6, the traditional mark of a balanced market, for years, but the inventory situation is much worse for existing homes, where realtors complain of a chronic and acute shortage of quality homes for sale," Stephen Stanley​, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in a note to clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a lot of people who would like to buy a house, and plenty of them can afford to. Finding a house to buy? That is another issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been less than brisk this year. On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that 5.43 million existing, or previously owned, homes were sold in May, at a seasonally adjusted, annual rate, compared with 5.6 million a year earlier. In 2018 to date, sales are 2% below last year's pace. That is a somewhat surprising development considering the strong jobs market that is driving up household incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of factors that might be weighing against home sales. One is that borrowing costs are higher. Another is that the tax plan's capping of state and local tax deductions and limiting mortgage interest deductions reduced the incentives for buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if demand were lower, housing prices would be falling and inventory would be rising. Neither is happening. The median sales price for an existing home in May was $264,800 versus $252,500 a year earlier. At May's less-than-stellar sales pace, the inventory of unsold single family homes would be exhausted in 4.1 months. In the 1990s, a typical decade for the housing market, there was a 5.6-month supply of unsold homes, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot of the supply issue comes down to how few homes are being built even now, nine years after the recession ended. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that there were an annualized 1.35 million housing starts last month -- up from 1.12 million a year earlier and the most since July 2007. But that was still below the levels that prevailed even in the 1970s, when the U.S. population was much lower. <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span> economists note that growth in U.S. housing stock has been persistently below working-age population growth throughout the years since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, big home builders don't have much of an incentive to seriously step up the pace of construction. They face less competition than they did in the past -- many smaller operators were wiped out in the housing bust. And rising material and labor costs are a further disincentive for boosting production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes it unlikely the housing supply problems are going to be solved soon, and that housing prices will keep heading higher.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Sarah Chaney </div><div>1192 words</div><div>20 June 2018</div><div>17:19</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A booming economy is providing little boost to the critical spring homebuying season, which is stuck in neutral due to a lack of inventory, high home prices and rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have declined compared with a year earlier in four out of the first five months of this year. Sales of previously owned U.S. homes dropped 0.4% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million—the second-consecutive month they declined, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in May were down 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The warm spring months near the end of the school year are an important test [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/could-this-be-the-worst-spring-in-years-for-home-sales-1520424001] for the housing market because some 40% of home sales each year take place in March through June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This should be a boom time for the housing market given that the U.S. is experiencing "the strongest economy in a near-generation," said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac. Surveys of household confidence are at elevated levels, and the unemployment rate in May ticked down to 3.8%, the lowest since April 2000. Sentiment and unemployment are usually strong drivers of demand for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, home sales are lackluster. That is locking many young home buyers out of the market when a good job market should give them the opportunity to purchase a first home. First-time buyers made up 31% of sales in May, down from 33% both the prior month and a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Mr. Khater said that is a missed opportunity for many millennials, who might find it hard to catch up, as prices are growing faster than incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 4.1-month supply of homes on the market at the end of May, based on the current sales pace, while economists say that six months of supply signals a healthy market. That means fewer homes for buyers to choose from. Total housing inventory at the end of May climbed 2.8% but is still 6.1% lower than a year earlier and has fallen year-over-year for 36 consecutive months, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply is tight in part because of a lack of new-home construction caused by regulatory barriers, lack of available land, and labor and material shortages. Existing homeowners also have been reluctant to put homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Rusk, 33 years old, and her husband are looking to upgrade to a four-bedroom home in Columbus, Ohio, as they start a family. The couple sold their first house for twice what they bought it for within days of putting it up for sale in May. As homes are quickly snatched off the market, the couple is struggling to find a home and is now planning to move into an apartment for a short period while waiting out the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From where we're sitting it's just crazy how short houses are sitting on the market," Ms. Rusk said. "We don't have a day to spare. If we find a house that we like that we want to put an offer in, we have to put an offer in the very next day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation could grow more challenging for buyers in the months ahead if mortgage rates continue rising. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in May was 4.59%, up more than half a point from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the median sale price for an existing home in May was $264,800, up 4.9% from a year earlier and a new all-time high, according to NAR. Prices have risen 71% from the low in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Incredibly low supply continues to be the primary impediment to more sales, but there's no question the combination of higher prices and mortgage rates are pinching the budgets of prospective buyers, and ultimately keeping some from reaching the market," said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax bill that passed in December also reduced some incentives for homeownership, especially in costly coastal markets and high-tax areas, by reducing the cap for the deductibility of mortgage interest and limiting the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted. However, economists and real-estate agents said that thus far the boost to most people's after-tax earnings provided by the bill is outweighing the reduction in the home-ownership-specific perks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khater said rates aren't yet high enough to convince people not to buy, but data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show slowing growth in the size of loans that borrowers are taking out. That suggests that home buyers are opting to purchase less expensive homes to compensate for higher borrowing costs. That ultimately pushes buyers at the bottom end of the market to the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam DeBord, a Realtor in Seattle, said the steep run-up in prices has made buyers more cautious about which properties they bid on, especially after many have already been outbid multiple times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home value in the city rose to $767,000 in April, up 87.5% in the last five years, according to Zillow, leading some buyers to question whether the market has already peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those numbers just really ring out to the average consumer as, "‘Is this something that I can afford long-term?'" Mr. DeBord said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates and home prices also help deter existing homeowners, many of whom enjoy historically low rates, from selling because the cost of purchasing a larger home is a significant jump from their current monthly payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanjiv Das, chief executive of Caliber Home Loans, a Dallas-based lender, said he is seeing existing homeowners choose to stay put and renovate because "the home down the street that they were looking at has gone up so much in price" they no longer feel they can afford to trade up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction is starting to pick up [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rebound-in-may-1529411701], but that mostly helps buyers at the high end of the market, while demand is most robust from buyers at lower price points. May saw 557,000 new listings hit the market, more than any month since July 2015, according to Realtor.com, but much of that increase was higher-end homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>474 words</div><div>20 June 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rebounded last month to the highest level since 2007, driven by a construction rebound in parts of the country that have lagged behind for much of the economic recovery as well as a lingering apartment boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 5% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Compared with a year earlier, starts were up 20.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong improvement was spread fairly evenly between single-family and multifamily, despite expectations that builders would pull back on new apartment construction because of a flood of new units already hitting the market. Single-family construction increased 3.9% in May, compared with a month earlier, while multifamily building increased 11.3%, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwestern builders also significantly ramped up construction, welcome news for a region that had lagged behind compared with the South and the West through much of the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wells Fargo &amp; Co. Senior <span class="companylink">Economist</span> Mark Vitner said part of the bump in the Midwest may be attributable to an improving manufacturing sector. "The economic recovery has broadened and it's reached parts of the country that hadn't seen improvement until recently," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. May's 5% jump for starts came with a margin of error of plus or minus 10.2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, which tend to be a more reliable indicator and signal how much construction is in the pipeline, declined 4.6% to an annual pace of 1.301 million last month. Permit declines in the South and West drove May's permits figure lower. Permits last month fell for both single-family and multifamily housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, housing construction appears on track to have a slightly better year than many economists had predicted, in part, because of surprisingly strong multifamily growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall starts grew by 11% in the first five months of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier. Multifamily starts rose 13.3% during that period; single-family starts rose 9.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, builders face headwinds in the coming months. Rising lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the cost of a new home since January 2017, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, which reported on Monday that builder confidence ticked down slightly in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vitner said larger home builders have more power to negotiate deals on material and labor prices, but smaller builders are struggling. "A lot of smaller builders are having to postpone projects . . . and say let's just sit this out and see if prices come down," he said.</p>

'People are looking for a safer place to go'</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>1102 words</div><div>15 June 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Rhea Hayes decided to sell her house in the wealthy, Southern California coastal community of Hope Ranch, she had a hunch it would go fast. She and her husband had been thinking of downsizing and heard the market was inundated with people who had lost their homes in the recent fire and mudslides in nearby Montecito.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought this timing could be good," says Ms. Hayes. It was: The three-bedroom ranch house on a 2-acre lot sold in just four days last month for $3.855 million -- just a smidgen below the asking price. The buyers had been asleep in their Montecito home when mud crashed through the walls and swept away most of their possessions. "They decided they were just going to move on and not look back," explains Ms. Hayes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idyllic seaside town of Montecito is still recovering from a catastrophe caused by one of the largest fires in California history and a subsequent mudslide in January that left more than 20 people dead and some 400 homes damaged or destroyed. Some areas of Montecito still look like a war zone, as boulders, trees, debris, cars and crushed houses slid down with the mud through residential areas. With its high-profile celebrity residents like Oprah Winfrey, Rob Lowe, Ellen DeGeneres and Jeff Bridges, near-perfect weather and large estates on multi-acre lots with mountain and ocean views, Montecito is hard to replicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest alternative is Hope Ranch, a 1,863-acre development just up the coast from Santa Barbara. In "the Ranch," as locals call it, the air is perfumed with flowers, the palm trees look like they're from central casting and most houses are protected by electronic gates. The paved roads, which wind through pine and lemon trees, are practically empty except for people walking their dogs. It's eerily quiet: Planes don't fly in its airspace, and it's a good distance from the train tracks and Highway 101 that run through Santa Barbara.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the number of homes sold soared in March in Hope Ranch -- up 133% from a year earlier, according to the Santa Barbara County recorder's office. The median sales price in Hope Ranch also jumped, up 21% to $3.4 million. So far this year three homes in Hope Ranch have sold for over $10 million, compared with two for all of last year and none in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are looking for a safer place to go," says Tim Dahl, a real-estate agent for Santa Barbara-based Compass. While Montecito is down the coast from Santa Barbara, with little space between the mountains and the sea, Hope Ranch is on the other side, with hills that separate it from the Santa Ynez range. As such, it's less vulnerable to the fires and mudslides, geologists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Behrman, 59, a hand surgeon, and his wife, Sonia, 40, paid $11.5 million in January for an 11,500-square-foot home in Hope Ranch. The couple didn't want to rebuild in Montecito after their home in the hills burned to the ground. They stayed for a week with their children at the home of one of Dr. Behrman's partners, who was then killed in the debris flow that swept down from the mountains in January. "It changed things in Montecito. It created a whole different emotional overlay," says Dr. Behrman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, FEMA released the results of a new geological survey that shows which areas in Montecito can expect flooding in heavy rainfalls and how the debris flow altered base flood elevations. The survey affects where homes can be built and the required height off the ground. Dina Landi, a managing partner with Riskin Partners in Montecito, says even if people do rebuild, the process could take two or more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, says Adrienne Schuele, a real-estate agent with Compass, the situation has prompted more homes in Hope Ranch to go on the market. "People who were once considering selling are now selling," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Sunday, Ed and Ann Richards were looking at a five-bedroom, six-bathroom Normandy-style estate on 2 acres that recently went on the market in Hope Ranch for $7.3 million. The couple already live in the community but they were hoping to find a house for their son, who was due to be married soon and whom they hope to lure from Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope Ranch homeowners Rene and Marisa Koke put their 7,261-square-foot, five-bedroom, nine-bathroom house on 4.8 acres on the market with an asking price of $15.25 million. Mr. Koke, who owns auto-body shops and rental homes, says they want to downsize within Hope Ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope Ranch is a community as opposed to a town: There are no grocery stores, shops or restaurants, aside from the dining room at the local country club. The some 750 homes start at around $2 million for a 3,500-square-foot ranch. A big draw is the 22 miles of bridle trails and a pristine private beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hope Ranch Park Homes Association, incorporated in 1924, enforces building restrictions, makes sure no one violates the minimum 30-day rental rule and runs a private patrol force that keeps cars from speeding and outsiders from lingering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this sort of community is what some people seek, others find the home association aspect somewhat stifling. And some people would never consider Hope Ranch a substitute, real-estate agents say. It doesn't have the gilded 93108 ZIP Code, and Oprah doesn't live there. Montecito is also 10 miles closer to Los Angeles, which can make a difference in high traffic, and has a good public high school, while Hope Ranch only has a private high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger issue is whether second-home buyers will be scared away from the Santa Barbara area as a whole. "There are people who are saying, 'Maybe we'll buy something in Orange County instead,'" says Tony Giordano, president of L.A.-based luxury real-estate firm, the Opulent Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dahl from Compass dismisses that: Last week he sold for $2.5 million the 4-acre lot in Montecito where Mr. Behrman's house burned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billionaire and philanthropist Elaine Wynn is relisting her Idaho estate for $19.5 million, or roughly 22% less than its original asking price. Despite the discount it remains the most expensive home for sale in the state, according to listings website Zillow and a spokeswoman for the listing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynn, 76, founded <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> with her then-husband, casino mogul Steve Wynn. They divorced in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynn and her then-husband bought the property in 2009, records show. It wasn't clear how much they paid. Ms. Wynn originally listed the home for $25 million in 2016, then took it off the market in February, according to listings website HotPads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is in Blaine County, almost 3 miles from the resort town of Sun Valley. It is set on almost 12 acres and overlooks the Big Wood River. The main house, which is built in log cabin-style with wooden beams and custom millwork, totals roughly 15,093 square feet, with four bedrooms and six bathrooms. Amenities include a theater room, a library, a gym and a massage area. Outside, there is a plunge pool and a fire pit. The property also includes two undeveloped parcels of land. Darlene Young of Engel &amp; Völkers has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wynn is <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span>' largest shareholder after Mr. Wynn resigned from his post as chief executive and sold off all his shares following a January article in The Wall Street Journal detailing allegations from current and former employees that would amount to a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct. Since then, Ms. Wynn has succeeded in pressing for changes at the company's board[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wynn-resorts-adds-three-women-to-board-bringing-it-to-11-members-1524090326].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wynn has said it is "preposterous" that he would assault a woman; and at the time, he didn't respond to other allegations of sexual misconduct. His attorney, Lin Wood, said in April: "Mr. Wynn has not engaged in any non-consensual sexual relations with any of the women upon whom the Journal has relied on its reporting." Mr. Wynn in April sued a former employee who was quoted in two Journal articles about the allegations, claiming that the former employee defamed him by spreading false accusations. The employee denied the accusations in a court filing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In "The Government Creates Another Housing Bubble" (op-ed, June 1), Paul Kupiec and Edward Pinto sound the alarm that easy credit is fueling a housing bubble, but they overlook four facts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid increase in house prices is being driven largely by a shortage of housing units. Over the last five years, we have averaged annual construction of 966,000 housing units compared with 1,552,000 a year between 1995 and 2004. Some of this shortage is attributable to overly burdensome local land and building regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current level of risk in the market is at a historic low. Much of the loosening of underwriting standards is due to either <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> competing for market share with the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration (FHA) </span>or modest changes in the debt-to-income ratios that only have very small effects on the likelihood of default. The Urban Institute's Housing Credit Availability Index shows that mortgage credit risk is half of what it was in the stable 2001-2004 period and a third of what is was during 2005-0707. Cash-out refinances were a much more significant contributor to the housing crisis than the expansion of lending to include more-marginal borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning a house is still less expensive than renting in many metropolitan areas. But perhaps most troubling is Messrs. Kupiec and Pinto's call for limiting borrower underwriting to control asset prices. Other countries have tried this approach, most notably China, and found that it results in distorted markets and slower economic growth. Such a move would further constrain access to credit and ignore the real cause of the crisis: risky products and cash-out refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also need to preserve homeownership opportunities for first-time home buyers and our growing minority population. Limiting access to credit will cut them both off.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current run up in home prices is the classic result of a supply/demand imbalance. Inventory of existing homes for sale is at a 20-year low, precipitated by a dearth of new-home construction. We are only building 1.3 million new units (single family and multifamily) annually, when demographics can support 1.5 million. Vacancy rates are well below their long-run averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons to make sure that lending standards aren't allowed to deteriorate. Nobody wants a repeat of the mistakes that led to the financial crisis. But if we are going to solve the problem, we must honestly and accurately identify its cause.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—An escalating trade quarrel[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/after-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-u-s-allies-move-to-coordinate-retaliation-efforts-1528313629] between Canada and the U.S. over steel and aluminum tariffs is ringing alarms in Canada's housing sector, as surging costs for construction steel add pressure to a cooling residential real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of construction steel, used to build condominiums, has already jumped as much as 50% during the past year to 1,400 Canadian dollars a ton, thanks to the expected tariffs and a strong construction market, said Richard Lyall, president of the Residential Construction Council of Ontario, a provincial trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the U.S. last week placed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-plans-to-hit-eu-with-steel-aluminum-tariffs-1527713954] from Canada and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
other allies[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tariffs-underline-u-s-tilt-away-from-european-allies-1527777399], Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced matching tariffs[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-slaps-steel-aluminum-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-european-union-1527774283] on U.S. imports: 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retaliatory tariffs, which are set to begin July 1, could push the cost of construction steel to as much as C$2,000 a ton, Mr. Lyall said. That means developers in Toronto building a 30-story condominium tower that uses 2,000 tons of steel would face C$2 million in extra costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This could be the steel that breaks the camel's back," said Mr. Lyall, whose group is calling for moderation in Canada's plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major Canadian cities including Toronto and Vancouver have experienced a building frenzy in recent years, with construction cranes and new high-rises dotting the horizon and house prices rising. Now, developers are struggling with higher land prices and increased regulations, said Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist for CIBC World Markets Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Construction costs have already been rising very rapidly, and the steel aspect of this is very major," he said. "It will take margins that were already shrinking and make them lower."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bank officials previously identified imbalances in Canada's housing sector as a vulnerability in the country's overall economy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bank-of-canada-focuses-on-smaller-lenders-amid-housing-slowdown-1527018202], in part because of speculative behavior by real-estate investors in Toronto and Vancouver. Deputy governor Sylvain Leduc said recently the bank expects rising wages and high consumer confidence to continue to support housing construction and consumption growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the pace of home building slowed in April, with housing starts falling almost 5%, and some economists anticipate a further cooling, as developers deal with higher construction costs and as overall housing activity slows. Canadian building permits, which can give an early indication of building activity, fell 4.6% in April, according to data released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To the extent that now these tariffs on steel will also put upward pressure on prices, that will also have a cooling effect," said Chris Gardner, president of the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association in British Columbia. Condominium developers who presold units could be particularly squeezed in the short term, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tougher mortgage-financing rules, introduced in January[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canada-imposes-tougher-mortgage-rules-effective-2018-1508248798], have also hit real-estate markets[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trade-uncertainties-mortgage-finance-rules-factored-into-canadian-interest-decision-1527788692] in many Canadian cities. Sales of existing homes fell nearly 3% in April from a year earlier, while prices rose at the slowest pace in nearly nine years, according to the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown weighed on economic growth during the first quarter, with Canada's gross domestic product rising 1.3% from a year earlier—falling short of market expectations[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadas-1st-quarter-gdp-falls-short-of-expectations-1527773921] for a 1.9% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gardner said that while lack of supply is a bigger concern, there's a risk the new tariffs could push housing markets into a steeper correction. "Overall, I think we're in a situation where the timing of these tariffs could not have been worse," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Vihant, executive vice president at Great Gulf, one of Canada's largest developers, says he has seen costs of construction steel for his projects rise between 10% and 15% this year, partially because real-estate markets in Canada and the U.S. are strong. Tariffs may only add to the cost inflation, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The costs hurt developers who are already struggling with higher taxes and levies from local governments, Mr. Vihant said. "We're getting squeezed on margins from all over."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are booming. So far, 2018 has posted the strongest growth since 2005. "About 60% of all U.S. metros saw an acceleration in the rate of price increases through February this year," according to Housing Wire. Since mid-2012, real home prices have increased 28%, according to data from the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>. Entry-level home prices are up about double that rate. In contrast, over the same period household income has barely kept pace with inflation. The current pace of home-price inflation is increasing the risk of another housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The root of the problem is declining underwriting standards. In April <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> announced an expansion of its 3% down-payment mortgage, the better to compete with the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. Such moves propel home prices upward. Because government agencies guarantee about 80% of all home-purchase mortgages, their underwriting standards guide the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making lending even more dangerous, CNBC recently reported that "credit scores may go up" because new regulatory guidance allows delinquent taxes to be excluded when calculating credit scores. These are only some of the measures that "expand the credit box" and qualify ever-shakier borrowers for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last crisis, easy credit led home prices to rise at an unsustainable pace, leading marginally qualified borrowers to stretch themselves thin. Millions of Americans' dreams became nightmares when the housing market turned. The lax underwriting terms that helped borrowers qualify for a mortgage haunted many households for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many as 10 million families lost their homes to foreclosure during the recession and housing crisis, according to Pew. This happened despite federal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">programs that modify mortgage payment terms to prevent foreclosure. While the home-price bubble affected homes at all price levels, the largest percentage gains and subsequent declines occurred in lower-priced markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minorities were disproportionately affected. A 2017 <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> study found that the housing boom-bust cycle had an exaggerated negative effect on the wealth of black and Latino households. And a 2014 study by the Urban Institute showed that these same minority groups have been slow to recover as household losses and tainted credit continued to depress postcrisis minority homeownership rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage underwriters need to tighten standards before it's too late. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and other government-sponsored enterprises should immediately require at least 5% down on 30-year conventional mortgages. They also should reinstitute a debt-to-income limit of 45% and stop guaranteeing loans on vacation and rental properties. The government-sponsored lenders should also avoid high-balance loans while limiting guarantees for most cash-out refinancing mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">FHA</span>'s original mandate was to assist lower-income Americans with buying their first home -- a goal worth sticking to. The <span class="companylink">FHA</span> should require at least 3.5% down on 30-year mortgages and limit seller concessions -- cash back from the seller at closing -- to 3%, since such concessions artificially inflate home-sale prices. The agency also should limit the debt-to-income ratio to 50% and require loans in excess of the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>'s 43% maximum to satisfy a residual-income test. <span class="companylink">FHA</span> guarantees for cash-out refinance mortgages can be done away with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current unsustainable pace of home-price inflation can be stopped only by damming the flood of government mortgage credit. Imposing prudent underwriting standards will improve home affordability, head off a new wave of mortgage foreclosures, and protect the most vulnerable Americans.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains showed no signs of slowing in March, putting continued pressure on buyers as mortgage rates have also recently risen to their highest levels in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 6.5% in March, identical to the year-over-year increase reported in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 6.5% over the year, up slightly from 6.4% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 6.8%, unchanged from the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected home price growth to decelerate slightly in March, with the 20-city index gaining 6.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price gains remained concentrated in the West. Seattle saw a 13% annual gain in prices, while Las Vegas prices increased 12.4% and San Francisco saw an 11.3% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, attributed the price gains to a lack of homes for sale. Housing inventory is near the lowest level in decades. "Until inventories increase faster than sales, or the economy slows significantly, home prices are likely to continue rising," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer noted, however, that the current gains remain more moderate than the last housing bubble, when nationally home price gains peaked at 14.5%—bigger than the current gains in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains accelerated in 2017 compared with 2016. Nonetheless, economists expected the pace of price growth to slow this year, due to a new tax law that passed in late February that reduced the incentive for homeownership, as well as rising mortgage rates that make owning a home less affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate for a 30-year mortgage rose to 4.66% last week from 3.99% at the end of last year, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Mortgage rates rose in 15 of the 21 weeks of the year so far-the highest share since Freddie began tracking the data in 1972.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability challenges and the shortage of inventory are dampening home sales. Existing-home sales fell 2.5% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million, the National Association of Realtors said last Thursday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in April were down 1.4%—the second consecutive month sales declined on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. home-price index rose 0.8% in March before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index rose 0.9% and 1% respectively from February to March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.4% month-over-month. The 10-city index rose 0.4% and the 20-city index rose 0.5%. All 20 cities saw price increases in March before seasonal adjustment and 19 out of 20 saw them rise with seasonal adjustment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned U.S. homes declined in April, as inventory shortages and rising prices weigh on the market and higher mortgage rates begin to pose a threat to demand for the first time in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 2.5% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Thursday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in April were down 1.4% -- the second consecutive month that existing-home sales declined on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far, the critical spring selling season -- when some 40% of U.S. home sales occur each year -- is off to a slow start despite a robust economy. That reflects increasing pressure on buyers, as home prices rise at about twice the rate of incomes and borrowing costs climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy has continued to show improvement, but the home sales are stuck and not breaking out," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for an existing home in April was $257,900, up 5.3% from one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate for a 30-year mortgage rose to 4.66% this week from 3.99% at the end of last year, mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest sales numbers reflect purchases that were closed in April, based on contracts signed in February and March. Rate increases were still modest when the contracts were signed and economists said the impact of higher rates will be felt more strongly in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said rising oil prices are also a challenge, as buyers will often trade longer commutes for more affordable home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The next two to three months will be really, really key. Can the market sustain its momentum given the trifecta of high rates, higher home prices and higher oil prices?" said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Encrypted Phones</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span> sought to defend itself from mounting accusations that it had irresponsibly relied on inflated statistics about the number of encrypted phones investigators were unable to access last year, saying there was no evidence the error was due to impropriety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no indication that this was misconduct," an <span class="companylink">FBI</span> official said Wednesday during a news briefing at the bureau's headquarters, adding that the error appeared to be the result of a computational mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FBI Director Christopher Wray and other senior officials repeatedly told Congress and the public in recent months that law-enforcement investigators were unable to unlock nearly 7,800 devices last year due to strong encryption. That figure was significantly overstated, the agency said late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wray has ordered an independent review of the miscalculation by the <span class="companylink">FBI</span> 's inspection division, and the bureau's technology division is also reviewing the problem, <span class="companylink">FBI</span> officials said Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Softened in April</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the U.S. fell at the beginning of spring, reversing the stronger momentum seen in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- fell 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 in April, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 2.2% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases have risen in three of the past six months, while sales rose 11.6% in April from a year earlier. Still, the pace of new-home sales remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More widely, housing market inventory has been tight, driving up home prices and pricing some potential buyers out of the market. The average sales price for new homes grew to $407,300 in April, the highest price on records dating back to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, at the current sales pace, there was a 5.4-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of March, down from the 6.0 levels seen in the middle of 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That requirement and other key provisions mirror a bill passed by the House in February, which would also make it easier for victims to report harassment.

Cases involving lawmakers would be referred to the ethics committee in the chamber where the lawmaker serves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate bill, announced Wednesday, also would ensure that lawmakers found guilty of harassment who leave office be held responsible for repaying any settlement, including through nongovernment wages or retirement accounts, if necessary. Senior staff accused of sexual harassment wouldn't be personally liable if a case is settled.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, created in 2007, allows people in public-service professions -- generally those working for the government or nonprofits -- to have their student loans canceled after 10 years of full and on-time payments.</p>

For example, some repayment plans -- such as graduated repayment, which increases the size of payments over the life of a loan -- are off limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Education Department said it would now allow people who were denied loan forgiveness to ask for their applications to be reconsidered, and officials said they would consider people entered in a variety of different income-based plans.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Daniel Kruger and Akane Otani </div><div>912 words</div><div>24 May 2018</div><div>19:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's rise in government-bond yields is rippling through the economy, affecting everything from mortgage rates to stock performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of steady economic growth and expectations for rising inflation have helped push the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note this year to its highest level since 2011, leaving <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bonds paying more than the debt from other developed countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors believe those conditions will persist, with minutes from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s May 1-2 meeting showing that central-bank officials could allow inflation to overshoot their 2% target for some time. The yield on the 10-year note retreated below 3% Thursday, notching its biggest two-day decline since March 1, although it remained near the year's high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, are up this year, lifted by expectations of an acceleration in growth and inflation following $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and a surge in government spending. Coming more than eight years into an economic expansion, analysts say such stimulative policies will boost the deficit and government borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now investors are asking at what point the rise in yields will begin to damp economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an element of risk that's pervaded the markets that we didn't have at the start of 2018," said Jody Lurie, a bond strategist at <span class="companylink">Janney Montgomery Scott</span>. Investors are wondering if there is any part of the market that won't be subject to losses, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising bond yields have already pushed up borrowing costs for home buyers, raising questions about whether higher rates will curb the appetites of consumers looking at big-ticket purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales fell in April[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fell-in-april-1527084276], the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, a reversal after momentum picked up in the first quarter. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.61% last week, the highest level since 2011[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-era-of-low-mortgage-rates-is-over-1526635801], according to data from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Maybe higher mortgage rates are starting to have an impact as much as home builders don't want to admit it," Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note to clients. "We are watching new-home sales like a hawk to tell us the Fed has raised interest rates too high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of rising bond yields is also being felt in the stock market, with many investors selling shares of utilities and real-estate companies—often regarded as bond proxies because of their relatively hefty dividend payouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 utility and real-estate sectors have fallen 5.2% and 6.3%, respectively, this year, ranking among the worst-performing in the S&amp;P 500. The broader index is up 2% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, shares of the beneficiaries of higher interest rates have started to tick higher, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large U.S. lenders up 2.6% for the year. Higher interest rates tend to boost banks' net interest margins, a key measure of lending profitability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher bond yields also have helped fuel a resurgence in the U.S. dollar, pushing investors to unwind long-held bets on emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, anemic bond yields in developed markets had pushed investors toward relatively risky emerging-market stocks and bonds, which offered higher returns. But the dollar's strengthening has made it more difficult for countries to service debt denominated in the U.S. currency, making emerging-market assets less attractive to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Turkish lira has slumped almost 20% against the dollar so far this year, pressured by concerns over the central bank's failure to raise interest rates as much as economists deem necessary to bolster the currency. <span class="companylink">Indonesia's central bank</span> last week raised interest rates for the first time in four years to arrest a drop in its currency, while the <span class="companylink">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span> stepped in to prop up the territory's weakening dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about these aftershocks on Wednesday drove investors into assets they see as safer stores of value, such as the Japanese yen and U.S. Treasurys, while stoking selling pressure in emerging-market assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which measures stock performance across more than 20 countries, is down 10.8% from its Jan. 26 high, while the <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> Emerging Market Bond Index is off 4.3% from its Jan. 5 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all investors are worried about the climb in bond yields. Some say higher yields could draw investors back into U.S. Treasurys, helping slow some of the selling in the bond market. And others note that bond yields, while up for the year, remain relatively low compared with historical levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many are betting a combination of higher debt issuance and divergent growth outlooks between the U.S. and the rest of the world will keep driving interest rates higher, a factor that could gradually start to take a bigger toll on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With investors wading through so many crosscurrents, the outlook for "2019 becomes very uncertain," said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at the United Nations Federal Credit Union.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They don't sell new homes like they used to. A big reason why is they don't make them like they used to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes fell 1.5% in April from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists had expected 679,000. There also were downward revisions to earlier months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were well up from a year earlier, so it hardly counts as a death knell for home builders. Still, given the strength of the economy, one might have expected a stronger start to the spring home-selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were just 2.6 new homes sold annually for every thousand people aged 16 and over living in the U.S. last month. That compares with an average rate of 3.5 during the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years immediately following the financial crisis, tepid new-home sales came down to a lack of buying power. More recently, the problem has been supply: There are far fewer new homes on the market than there tended to be precrisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders can't easily step up construction. Labor availability has become a concern. One reason that <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> shares fell sharply following its results Tuesday is that it said labor costs had eaten into margins. Raw materials are costlier too, with framing lumber fetching 39% more than a year ago, according to lumber industry newsletter Random Lengths. Last but not least, 30-year mortgage rates just hit a seven-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a home that people can afford to buy is only going to get tougher.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes in the U.S. fell at the beginning of spring, reversing the stronger momentum seen in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales— fell 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 in April [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs?mod=article_inline], the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a larger 2.2% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases have risen in three of the past six months, while sales rose 11.6% in April from a year earlier. Still, the pace of new-home sales remains well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales data can be volatile. Ahead of the report's release, analysts forecast an April decline to make up for March's monthly new-home sales growth. April's 1.5% decline came with a margin of error of 11.8 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The April drop was "a little lower than consensus, but the data are highly volatile and the net result is still a rise so far this year," Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at consultants High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More widely, housing market inventory has been tight, driving up home prices and pricing some potential buyers out of the market. The average sales price for new homes grew to $407,300 in April, the highest price on records dating back to 1963. Meanwhile, at the current sales pace, there was a 5.4-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of March, down from the 6.0 levels seen in the middle of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are also a headwind for the housing market. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.47% in April, up from 4.03% in January. Mortgage rates still remain well below prerecession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, sales of previously owned homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-march-1524492258?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=9&amp;mod=article_inline], which represent the bulk of the U.S. market, ticked up from the prior month but were below year-earlier levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home builders' future expectations of single-family home sales improved in May for the first time this year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' recently released housing-market index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB "index is still down a bit since year-end, but there is no sign of ongoing weakening," Mr. O'Sullivan said in a note to clients last week. "The pattern suggests some loss of momentum, but probably in the form of slower growth rather than contraction."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of high-end home builder Toll Brothers Inc. fell 10% after the company reported lower-than-expected profit margins for the three months ended April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been concern among investors that a rise in mortgage rates since January could be a deterrent to the home-building industry. Average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages last week rose to a seven-year high[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-era-of-low-mortgage-rates-is-over-1526635801] of 4.61%, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> executives said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts Tuesday that the rise in rates hasn't affected its business so far, citing strong sales in lower-cost markets such as Boise, Idaho, where buyers might be more sensitive than higher-end customers to fluctuations in interest rates. The company focuses largely on high-end homes with average price tags double those of other large builders, and executives said those buyers are less susceptible to fluctuations in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our clients have much higher credit ratings. They put more money down," said Chief Executive Doug Yearley. "It's generally easier for them to get a mortgage because they're not tapped out when rates go up a little bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted gross profit margin for <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> was 22.5% for the second quarter ended in April, below the company's previous guidance and down from 24.3% in the same quarter last year. The company said profit margins for the quarter were down because of some specific operational issues: delays on some particularly profitable homes in California, and a push to sell condominium inventory in New York City to generate cash for other priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> closed at $39.46 on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company has also been affected by higher costs for labor and materials, particularly lumber, which has risen to record highs in 2018 after the Trump administration's decision last year to place tariffs [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-panel-locks-in-final-tariffs-on-canadian-softwood-lumber-1512666870]on Canadian lumber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Micenko, a home-building analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, said the disappointing gross profit margin could mostly be attributed to one-time operational issues for the quarter. But he said the timing wasn't great, because of investors' concerns about how interest rates could affect the housing market more broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most investors right now are hypersensitive to rising rates and the potential impact on demand," he said. "This is a tough quarter to have some operational issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Mr. Micenko said he is still seeing strong home-buying demand, based on discussions with other builders and in surveys of buyers. Demand is related more to broader trends in the economy, rising equity in one's current home, or life events such as a new marriage or the birth of a child, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's very few people who buy a house solely based on where mortgage rates are," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week ahead, readings on U.S. home sales, consumer sentiment and durable-goods orders will be released; the U.K. will see new inflation data; and the eurozone gets a report on services and manufacturing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The big question facing policy makers at the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>, and investors and businesses in turn, is whether the eurozone's unexpected economic slowdown in the first quarter was a weather-related blip or something more permanent. <span class="companylink">IHS Markit</span>'s composite purchasing managers index for May—a measure of activity in the services and manufacturing sectors—will provide further clues.

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Chaney and Laura Kusisto </div><div>485 words</div><div>16 May 2018</div><div>11:03</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell in April, signaling factors such as rising material and construction labor costs are holding down home building despite solid buyer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 3.7% in April from the prior month [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-rise-on-apartment-building-1523968342], to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.287 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, dropped 1.8%, to an annual pace of 1.352 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 11.3% decline in starts for multifamily units dragged down the overall starts figure and represents a reversal of the outsize gains for multifamily starts in March. Single-family home construction also illustrated weakness in April, declining in every region except for the South, where starts popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. April's 3.7% decline for starts came with a margin of error of 11.4 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factors such as rising material costs and labor shortages are converging to pose challenges to builders seeking to meet demand for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This disappointing housing starts report seems to indicate that home builders are finally saying ‘Uncle,' " said John Pataky, chief consumer and commercial banking executive at EverBank. "After months of fighting to keep up with still-surging demand, the realities of higher input prices, a limited supply of lots and decreasing confidence seem to be taking their toll."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the weakness in the Midwest and Northeast could be because of atypical snow and weather, said Scott Volling, principal at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But, if you take a step back and look at a more macro level, the quote I hear most often from builders is, ‘we can't outbuild our labor,' " Mr. Volling said. "They may have lots ready to go, and there may be demand out there, but they can't go any faster than their labor pool allows them to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite solid job and income gains [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-adds-164-000-jobs-in-april-unemployment-falls-to-3-9-1525437126] that support housing demand, headwinds in the single-family market persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising material costs, caused in part by a tariff on Canadian softwood lumber [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-panel-locks-in-final-tariffs-on-canadian-softwood-lumber-1512666870], could also threaten to slow single-family home construction going forward. Lumber costs have risen 50% since the beginning of 2017, adding about $7,000 to the cost of building a home, according to Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz said so far single-family building has proven "remarkably resilient" to rising interest rates and higher construction costs. But eventually, he said, there will come a point where the market will take a pause.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An explosion and fire at a Wisconsin refinery owned by <span class="companylink">Husky Energy Inc</span>. injured roughly 20 people Thursday, according to a local fire official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First responders were at the scene of the incident, which took place Thursday morning at the Superior Refinery in Superior, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mel Duvall, a spokesman for Husky Energy, a Canadian company based in Calgary, Alberta, confirmed it was responding to an incident but said it was unsure how many people were injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said in a statement that all personnel were accounted for. There were no immediate reports of deaths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are aware that there have been injuries, we do not have an exact number at this time," Mr. Duvall said. "Our priority right now is on ensuring the safety of the personnel and responding to the situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the fire reignited Thursday afternoon, Douglas County authorities ordered an evacuation around the refinery of an area that spanned 2 miles to the north, 3 miles to the east and west, and 10 miles south. The county is home to roughly 44,000 people, according to Census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Husky announced last August that it was acquiring the facility, which can produce 50,000 barrels a day, from <span class="companylink">Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P</span>. for $435 million. It said in a regulatory filing that the final closing price in November was $527 million, including $85 million of working capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration</span> said Thursday that it has opened an investigation into the explosion and fire. OSHA said it fined Calumet $21,000 over emergency response and flammable liquids violations at the facility in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Jauch, a former Wisconsin state senator, said he and his daughter were at home in Poplar, Wis., having breakfast when they heard a strange boom and "felt something shake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was such an unusual jolt, my daughter thought it was an earthquake," Mr. Jauch said, adding that they later learned of the blast in Superior, about 20 miles away.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown </div><div>792 words</div><div>25 April 2018</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bond-offering document from WeWork Cos. this week provides a glimpse into the finances of one of the world's most valuable startups, showing how the shared-office company is rapidly expanding revenue—and incurring heavy losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WeWork raised $702 million in its first bond sale [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/wework-raises-702-million-with-first-bond-sale-1524690190]as it continues to plow money into expansion through acquisitions and new shared-office locations around the world. The eight-year-old company has typically raised money through direct investments, attracting more than $6 billion in investment, most recently at a valuation of about $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After analyzing the offering documents on Tuesday, S&amp;P Global Ratings assigned WeWork a rating of B, five notches below investment grade into junk territory, while <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> gave the company a BB-minus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have rushed into WeWork in the hope that it will be able to sustain its rapid growth; it has roughly been doubling its revenue and memberships every year. Last year, WeWork's revenue doubled to $866 million, according to the offering documents. The revenue comes mostly from monthly rental payments it calls memberships, as well as sales of some services such as business software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But losses also more than doubled to $933 million as the company incurs hefty construction costs for most of the new offices it opens. WeWork spends millions of dollars renovating new offices with glass walls, modern lighting and furniture, investments the company says will pay off in the future. Discounts are often used to fill new offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financials underscore WeWork's vast market opportunity as well as the high cost of its growth. The company rents office space with long-term leases, then subleases it out a month or year at a time. Its millennial-friendly vibe—fruit water and beer are dispensed at no charge—has proven popular with startups, and, increasingly, with bigger corporations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WeWork has previously said its offices that have been open for at least a year have high occupancy rates and strong profit margins, so it is investing to gain scale. Rating agency S&amp;P, in a note Tuesday, called WeWork's growth "well measured."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the offering documents, WeWork went to unusual lengths to show ways in which the company would be profitable. While many companies typically offer "adjusted" earnings, WeWork offered three different layers of adjustments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It called the fully adjusted number "community adjusted Ebitda," by which it subtracted not only interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but also basic expenses like marketing, general and administrative, and development and design costs. Those earnings were $233 million, WeWork said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've never seen the phrase 'community adjusted Ebitda' in my life," said Adam Cohen, founder of Covenant Review, a bond research company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers offer some positive signs for WeWork. Its net construction costs per desk fell 22% in 2017 to $5,631. And its corporate business—as opposed to revenue from freelance and small companies—appears to be growing well, as rating agency <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> said in its analysis. The agency said it expects large corporations will occupy 50% of WeWork's desks within two years, up from 25% today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also are concerns for investors in WeWork's growth trajectory. Its revenue per user fell 6.2% to $6,928 in 2017, while sales-and-marketing costs more than tripled to $139 million, representing 16% of revenue, up from 9.9% in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said it expects "meaningfully negative" cash flow this year and next as the company expands. It said the company had $2 billion of cash on hand at the end of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking on debt adds risk to a company whose business model hasn't been tested in a downturn. Given that its members typically sign monthly or annual leases, a drop in demand during a recession would mean the rents it charges tenants would fall, while the payments it owes to landlords would stay constant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt adds another liability beyond leases—a factor that has hurt serviced office companies in the past. Former executives at <span class="companylink">HQ Global Workplaces LLC</span>—an office-space provider that rose to prominence during the dot-com boom and tumbled into bankruptcy after the bust—have said that layering debt on top of long-term leases was a big factor behind the company's downfall.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing Arguments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Made in Cosby Trial</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Cosby's lawyers and prosecutors faced off in closing arguments Tuesday in his sexual-assault retrial, clashing over whether the entertainer or his accuser lied about an alleged sexual encounter in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cosby's attorney, Thomas Mesereau, painted his accuser Andrea Constand as a con artist who fabricated assault allegations in order to file a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby in 2005. The entertainer paid Ms. Constand $3.38 million to settle the suit, without admitting any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're dealing with a pathological liar, members of the jury," said Mr. Mesereau. "Bill Cosby got conned big time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montgomery County Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden repeatedly stated that Mr. Cosby was the "con." She argued that Mr. Cosby used his star power and image to gain the confidence of young women, including Ms. Constand, then drug and sexually assault them. "He is nothing like the image that he plays on TV," Ms. Feden said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- increased 4.0% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence rose 1.7 points from a month earlier to 128.7 in April. Confidence had dipped in March after hitting the highest level since 2000 in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans boosted their impressions of current economic conditions as well as their expectations for future conditions this month, the latest survey shows. In perhaps the most significant development, the share of Americans expecting their incomes to decline over the next six months -- 6% -- fell to the lowest level since December 2000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. new-home sales surged in March, capping off a strong first quarter in a segment of the housing market characterized by solid buyer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales—increased 4.0% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 in March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March's rise comes on the back of a 3.6% increase in February and upward revisions for both January and February sales rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solid sales gains show a low unemployment rate and historically low layoff levels are supporting demand for housing, said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The other big driver is that millennials are reaching a point in their lives when they're beginning to get married, start a family and are looking to buy a home," Mr. Vitner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new-home sales can be choppy from month to month, and March's 4.0% gain came with a margin of error of 18.6 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the broader picture shows strength in the market for new homes. Sales rose 8.8% through the 12 months ended in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a 5.2-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of March, lower than the January and February figures but reflective of a jump in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other inventory measures indicate progress. The number of homes for sale at the end of March grew about 13% from a year earlier, signaling that home construction is beginning to catch up with buyer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are selling homes virtually as fast as they can build them," Mr. Vitner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which account for the bulk of the housing market, were well below year-earlier levels in March [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-march-1524492258], in part due to tight inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is likely that the lack of supply of existing homes, and the resulting stagnant pace of sales in that sector, is pushing home buyers into the new home sales market," said Nationwide Chief Economist David Berson in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the increase in new-home inventory levels, rising demand is contributing to a run-up in home prices, Mr. Berson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home sold in March was $337,200, up 4.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are adding to the affordability crunch. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.44% in March, up from 4.03% in January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Still, mortgage rates remain well below prerecession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pickup in interest rates is more likely to spur folks who are thinking about buying a home to go ahead and do it," Mr. Vitner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the West were particularly strong, growing 28.3% in March from a month earlier and posting the best annual sales rate in more than a decade. Sales in Northeast were less robust, which could be due to harsh weather in the region.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains accelerated in February for the 70th-consecutive month, creating increasingly challenging conditions for buyers as interest rates also rise and inventory remains tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which covers the entire nation, rose 6.3% in February, up from a 6.1% year-over-year increase reported in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 6.5% over the year, up significantly from 6% the prior month. The 20-city index gained 6.8%, up significantly from 6.4% the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected home-price growth to decelerate in February, with the 20-city index gaining 6.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With expectations for continued economic growth and further employment gains, the current run of rising prices is likely to continue," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have risen for 70 consecutive months since May 2012, with annual increases averaging 6% over that time, Mr. Blitzer said. That compares to the previous housing boom, when price rose for 182 consecutive months from January 1992 to February 2007 and gains averaged 6.1%. That suggests strong price gains could have plenty of runway left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains accelerated in 2017 compared with 2016. Nonetheless, economists expected the pace of price growth to slow this year, due to a new tax law enacted in late December that reduced the incentive for homeownership, as well as rising mortgage rates that make owning a home less affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability challenges and the shortage of inventory are dampening home sales. Existing-home sales increased 1.1% in March from a month earlier but declined compared with a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that are seeing the steepest increases remain concentrated in the West. Seattle reported the largest annual gain, at 12.7%, followed by Las Vegas at 11.6% and San Francisco saw a 10.1% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.4% in February before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index both rose 0.7% from January to February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.5% month-over-month. The 10-city index and the 20-city index both rose 0.8%. All 20 cities saw price increases in February before and after seasonal adjustment.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes ticked up in March from a month earlier but were below year-earlier levels as tight inventory levels, rising mortgage rates and high prices made for a sluggish start to the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 1.1% in March from February to a seasonally annual rate of 5.6 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. Compared with a year earlier, sales declined 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market seems to be plateauing lately rather than breaking through," according to Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales declined in December and January before rebounding in February. They are still at roughly the same level as when President Donald Trump was elected, noted Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The March results were largely in line with economists' expectations for the housing market this year: a lackluster performance despite accelerating economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A limited supply of homes has helped drive up prices while curtailing sales volume. There was a 3.6-month supply of homes on the market in March based on the current sales pace, while economists say six months indicates a balanced market. The median sale price for an existing home in March was $250,400, up 5.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory is especially tight at the lower end of the market. Deals for homes priced below $250,000 declined in March on an annual basis, while transactions for homes above $250,000 grew robustly.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Daniel Kruger </div><div>1011 words</div><div>23 April 2018</div><div>16:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> note approached 3% Monday, hitting a multiyear high as investors bet that a pickup in inflation and economic growth would erode the value of government debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which influences borrowing costs for consumers, corporations and local governments, rose for a fourth straight session, reaching as high as 2.996% in early trading before settling at 2.973%—its highest closing level since January 8, 2014. The yield was 2.949% Friday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's yield gains came after the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said existing home sales climbed 1.1% in March from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.60 million, topping the estimates of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Signs of economic growth tend to erode the value of bonds by increasing the appeal of riskier assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year yield has climbed toward 3% this year, lifted by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raising interest rates and investors' increasing confidence in economic growth and the prospects for a tickup in inflation. It is a climb that stalled out as the yield approached the milestone in late February, leaving investors wondering if the latest rise is sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and analysts have pointed to signs of inflation as one factor behind the yield's gains, particularly rising prices for commodities, including oil, and trade tensions with China. Inflation threatens the value of government bonds by eroding the purchasing power of their fixed payments and can spur the Fed to raise interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, investors are increasingly betting the Fed has is preparing to raise interest four times this year, more than the three that officials initially penciled in at their meetings in December and March. Fed funds futures, used by investors to place bets on central bank policy, late Monday suggested a 48% probability the Fed raises rates three more times this year, up from 33% a month ago, according to <span class="companylink">CME Group</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a confluence of factors that, combined, conspired to produce a move higher in yields," said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union. "It's occurred relatively rapidly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising bond yields can reflect growing confidence in the economy, that hasn't been apparent in the difference between short and longer-term rates. As the 10-year yield has climbed, Fed rate increases have been driving two-year yields higher at an even faster pace. That has narrowed the gap between the two yields to about 0.5 percentage point, down from 1.25 percentage points at the end of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The so-called yield curve, which measures the spread between short- and long-term rates, is a key indicator of sentiment about the prospects for economic growth. Two-year yields tend to rise along with investors' expectations for tighter Fed interest-rate policy, while longer-term yields are more responsive to sentiment about prospects for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The narrowing gap between the two yields reflects investors' confidence that the Fed will maintain its current pace of interest-rate increases despite continuing skepticism that growth will break out of its postcrisis torpor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because short-term rates have exceeded longer-term rates before each recession since at least 1975—a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve—investors become wary as the curve flattens. Yet the flattening has occurred while economic growth continues to be steady, and few analysts see signs of any imminent slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts expect higher yields to attract investors back into bonds. Others have suggested that the climb could accelerate with increasing confidence in the economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While "there's an argument to be made either way," it appears "there are investors waiting for 3% to buy," said Ian Lyngen, head of <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond strategy at <span class="companylink">BMO Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low-interest-rate environment in the rest of the world is likely to slow any rise in U.S. yields, by making U.S. debt more attractive than bonds from other countries. The 10-year yield on sovereign debt is 0.633% in Germany, 0.057% in Japan and 1.534% in the U.K., according to <span class="companylink">Tradeweb</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think it's premature this year for huge moves, because we still have low rates elsewhere," said Michael Cloherty, head of interest-rate strategy for <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will get a new read on the U.S. economy Friday when the Commerce Department releases its initial estimate of economic growth in the first quarter. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal are forecasting a 2.1% rise in output, compared with a 2.6% increase in the last three months of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While higher yields have the potential to act as a drag on growth by making it more expensive for consumers and companies to borrow, investors said they don't yet perceive higher borrowing costs as a significant economic risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield's climb to new 2018 highs came ahead of heavy schedule of government bond auctions. The Treasury plans to sell $113 billion of notes this week, and $116 billion of short-term bills. The government increased its longer-term note and bond issues by $42 billion for the months of February through April, and analysts expected a similar increase for the next three-month period. The initial note offering is scheduled to be a $32 billion sale of two-year Treasurys on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in yields to 3% would be "a really big deal," said Thomas di Galoma, head of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings. The "general angst about the growing deficits we're going to see in this country has gotten people turned around" and could lead to a 3.5% 10-year yield this year, he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>802 words</div><div>20 April 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to escape the traffic and congestion of the Seattle area, Nia Collins has her eye on a model home in a new gated community in Wenatchee, Wash., about 150 miles to the east. She expects the home will go on the market for around $700,000. But she doesn't know exactly -- because nobody has returned her calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's so much going on they can't keep up," says Ms. Collins, a 58-year-old interior designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses are not so easy to find in Wenatchee these days. The real-estate market in this town of 33,000 residents has been roiled by an infusion of bitcoin miners looking for cheap electricity to run and cool computers that generate new units of cryptocurrencies. Located on the Columbia River, Wenatchee is powered by hydroelectric dams and has some of the lowest rates in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents have been getting calls for months from prospective home buyers and renters looking for properties with a detached garage or shed -- places where a bitcoin miner could store servers, says Jamie Wallace, president of the North Central Washington Association of Realtors. Separately, Wenatchee properties are being advertised to bitcoin miners in online classifieds and on social media, according to <span class="companylink">Chelan County Public Utility District</span>, which serves the county that includes Wenatchee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February the Wenatchee City Council imposed a one-year ban on cryptocurrency mining in residential and mixed-use zones, citing safety concerns and potential strains on the electrical grid. Last month, the utility district declared a moratorium on applications for cryptocurrency and other data-related activities. The commissioners also directed staff to take all available steps to halt unauthorized crypto operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of cryptocurrency mining comes on top of an uptick in buyers looking for a home in Wenatchee and the surrounding area. Exiles from Seattle and California, both retirees and younger couples, have been relocating to the area, which has more affordable homes and extensive outdoor recreation, such as hiking, water sports and skiing in the nearby Cascade Mountain Range. Last year, Forbes magazine named Wenatchee one of the 25 best-places to retire, another factor fueling demand, real-estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Wenatchee grew 11% in February compared with a year earlier, while supply remained tight, with the number of active listings down 19%, according to Wenatchee-based Pacific Appraisal Associates, which also says there are currently seven homes on the market priced at over $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is also on the rise -- there were 26 single-family dwelling permits issued through February, more than double the 12 permits issued in the same period of 2017. But developers say they're stymied by limited buildable land and a shortage of construction labor. Real-estate agents say a two-bedroom rental house that went for $600 a month a couple of years ago is now getting rates around $1,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We looked and looked," says Jim Wonn, a retired tech executive who moved to Wenatchee after buying a lot and building a house last year for $450,000, moving in in November. Mr. Wonn says he's heard about the fires caused by bitcoin-mining computers overloading electric-service wiring, but all the people he knows who have moved to Wenatchee in the past few years are retirees or second-home owners who plan to eventually retire there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Holt, 50, just finished building a new 2,700-square-foot house for $290,000, which he considers a good deal: He now rents the 1,000-square-foot house where he was living before for $1,400 a month. Mr. Holt, an automobile dealer, says he made the decision to build and rent in part because building costs haven't gone up as fast as rents. Changes in Wenatchee are happening at "an alarming rate" he says -- especially an increase in traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Collins, the interior designer, says traffic conditions are still better in Wenatchee than in Seattle. When she started her house hunt, she set a $300,000 price point. But when she couldn't find much, she doubled it. Even that may not be enough. A couple weekends ago she looked at a 10,000-square-foot house in Wenatchee, advertised as a castle, with a saltwater swimming pool and an acre of landscaped property listed for $1.7985 million, but decided it was too big and old. So the hunt continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm just looking for peace," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. housing starts increased in March but single-family home construction pulled back, which could spell continued inventory shortages and rapid price increases for buyers in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing starts increased 1.9% in March [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.319 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was driven by a ramp up in construction of multifamily housing. Starts for buildings with five units or more jumped 16.1% from a month earlier, even as starts for single-family homes declined 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a step back for single family and a surge forward for multifamily," said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. "For single family, it's the opposite of what we need to see."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Multifamily activity is subject to especially large swings. March's 1.9% rise in starts came with a margin of error of 12.4 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which signal how much construction is in the pipeline and tend to be more reliable month-to-month, increased 2.5% to an annual pace of 1.354 million last month. Single-family permits were down 5.5% compared with February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a five-year boom in apartment construction, builders have been pulling back on new projects in the past year due to an excess of supply in many major urban markets. Economists expect new multifamily starts to be essentially flat this year compared with last year, while they are expecting a near three-decade high in the number of units completed as projects work their way through the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is one surprise, it's just the length of this multifamily cycle," said Jay Parsons, a vice president at real estate software and analytics firm <span class="companylink">RealPage</span>. "While supply is outpacing demand, there's still an awful lot of demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the acceleration in multifamily starts continues it could signal that developers are shifting back to building rental properties as single-family demand faces headwinds. Rising interest rates and a tax code that is less favorable to homeownership have emerged in recent months as possible challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts are down nearly 5% so far this year in the northeast, the region of the country likely to be the most impacted by tax changes that kicked in this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The change toward multifamily could be the initial signs that affordability is starting to impact the mix of construction," said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree. "Notably, single-family starts are particularly weak in the high-cost northeast, which is also the most exposed region to the negative impacts of the tax plan." Among other things, the tax bill passed in December [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/how-tax-law-will-help-some-housing-markets-1514116801] limits deductions for property taxes, which tend to be higher in the northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing demand is outstripping supply [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460]. Single-family construction is about half of what it was at the peak of the last housing market in 2006 and 30% below normal levels, which is helping to drive up prices and creating bidding wars [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/just-how-widespread-is-the-housing-shortage-1523876401] in many markets, according to Ms. Hale of Realtor.com. Economists expect single-family starts to increase 5% to 10% this year, not enough to meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence slipped in April, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' monthly survey. Builders indicated that the unusually long winter in many parts of the country dampened demand and held back construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders also cite soaring lumber prices and labor shortages as major obstacles to ramping up construction. That could especially affect builders targeting young buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you think about an entry-level home builder who is now entering that space, that's going to be a big factor," said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longer-term, housing construction is still strengthening. Overall starts increased by 8% in the first three months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>957 words</div><div>16 April 2018</div><div>07:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's housing shortage[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460] is more wide-ranging than cloistered coastal markets, stretching from pricey locales such as California and Massachusetts to more surprising places, such as Arizona and Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 22 states and the District of Columbia have built too little housing to keep up with economic growth in the 15 years since 2000, resulting in a total shortage of 7.3 million units, according to research to be released Monday by an advocacy group for loosening building regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California bears half of the blame for the shortage: The state built 3.4 million too few units to keep up with job, population and income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research was commissioned by Up for Growth National Coalition, a newly formed group that includes real-estate developers and owners such as Holland Property Group in Vancouver, Wash., and <span class="companylink">Essex Property Trust Inc</span>. in California, along with affordable-housing builder BRIDGE Housing. It also includes local California chambers of commerce and TechNet, a network of technology-company executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data adds details to a housing-shortage picture painted by government data, industry results and economists. Home construction per household remains near the lowest level in 60 years of record-keeping, according to Jordan Rappaport, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is growing awareness that the housing shortage is widespread and it affects states not often thought of as being especially anti-development. Home prices nationally rose 6.2%[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-home-prices-push-borrowers-deeper-into-debt-1523356200] in the year that ended in January, roughly twice the rate of incomes and three times the rate of inflation, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The artificial barriers to housing production aren't constrained just to California," said Mike Kingsella, executive director of the Up For Growth National Coalition. "As we dug into the numbers behind this, at a local market level, we're seeing a pronounced affordability challenge in places like even Arizona."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona and Utah are among the states that have built too little housing in the 15-year period, according to the report. The shortage in these places likely reflects strong demand as they become top destinations for retirees and people priced out of the Northeast and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, it is becoming more difficult to build all across America [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460]due to shortages of land, labor and materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern Nevada has about a two months' supply of homes for sale at the current sales pace, when about six months is considered a balanced market between sellers and buyers. Las Vegas saw home prices rise 11% in the year ended January, making it the second-fastest growing market for home prices in the country, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas has historically swung from extreme home-building binges to severe busts, but a decade after the housing crash it looks more like the rest of the country. Builders have been more cautious about putting up new homes, and the economy has become more diverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have home builders that are building like crazy trying to keep up with demand, and they can't build fast enough," said Chris Bishop, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors, which isn't part of the advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers who are part of the Up for Growth coalition have a vested interest in advocating for loosening planning regulations; they stand to make money from increased housing production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Up for Growth report, conducted by ECONorthwest, an economic consulting firm, examines how much housing was built in the U.S. compared with economic drivers of housing demand, such as home prices, population growth and incomes. It compares production from 2000 to 2015 with rates of production since the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists who have reviewed the report caution that measuring the present need for housing by extrapolating from past production is imperfect. Western states that were sparsely populated 60 years ago and experienced huge building booms in the latter half of the 20th century may not need to build at such a rapid clip today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing shortages also are difficult to measure because most people will find somewhere to live by doubling up with family or roommates or moving to areas where homes are abundant but jobs may be scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the data underscore what economists say is a clear trend. "We have a housing deficit," said Chris Herbert, managing director at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. "I think we can all agree we should be building more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix metropolitan area has about three months of supply at the current sales pace. Prices rose 5.9% in the year ended January, according to Case-Shiller. In Boise, Idaho, buyers are reporting bidding wars[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/boise-idaho-feels-the-growing-pains-of-a-surging-population-1523793600] and some are paying in cash[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/want-that-house-youd-better-pay-in-cash-1512469800], a new phenomenon for what was once a sleepy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has environmental and other regulations that can add years and tens of thousands of dollars to development costs. That has collided with a booming technology sector to help the median price of a home in the state more than double to nearly $540,000 since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently, California state Sen. Scott Wiener proposed allowing developers to build taller buildings near public transit even if local zoning doesn't permit it, in an effort to promote more housing near transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"California is certainly the poster child of what happens when you don't build enough housing and when you don't fund enough affordable housing," the Democrat said. "It's going to take years and frankly decades to truly resolve the problem."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>1085 words</div><div>15 April 2018</div><div>08:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOISE, Idaho—Laura Johansen has always loved the easiness of life in her hometown: The first-rate hiking and rafting a short drive from her front door. The quick commute to her job at a local hospital. The affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Ms. Johansen, who was renting her home, decided to buy a house earlier this year, the Idaho native was shocked. The median price of a single-family home in Boise's Ada County had shot up to almost $300,000, well-above the $200,000 homes she was eyeing when she first considered homeownership two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It does make it tough on locals like us," said the 57-year-old administrative assistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same qualities that have kept Ms. Johansen here are drawing waves of new arrivals from other states, making Idaho the fastest-growing state in the nation last year, according to the U.S. Census. Low costs and a business-friendly government are luring new employers, whose workers relish the backdrop of forested mountains above cities like Boise and the easy access to an outdoor paradise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just fell in love with Boise," said Mac Harman, founder and chief executive officer of Redwood City, Calif.-based Balsam Brands, an online home décor retailer that has roughly doubled the number of employees at its new downtown office here over the past two years. "The people are so kind, and everything is so new and beautiful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Idaho—and its capital city—have boomed, the state is also struggling to cope with the byproducts of its success: soaring housing prices, labor shortages and worsening traffic congestion in one of the more wide-open places in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift is a far cry from a decade ago when Idaho's economy collapsed during the recession, in part due to a housing glut. The state has since rebounded bigger than ever—with its population jumping 10% from 2011 to more than 1.7 million in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of job growth has increased to the highest in the country, much of it concentrated in the Boise metro area, home to some 700,000 people. Construction cranes dot the modest-sized downtown, while new home developments extend into farm fields on the city's outskirts. At a Hammett Homes subdivision, cows grazed lazily behind a row of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Idaho's low crime rate, affordability and scenery have attracted Californians especially. According to U.S. Census data, 85% of Idaho's 15,784 net new arrivals from other states came from California in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're coming from California in droves, because it's gotten to the point we don't want to live there anymore," said Toni Wolfe, 51, a Los Angeles police detective who expects to retire this year, as she toured the Avimor development in the foothills above Boise. Ms. Wolfe said the idea of raising her daughter in a safe community was appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boise's newfound popularity has already led to a housing shortage, with locals bearing the brunt. Median single-family home prices in Ada County have doubled from $147,000 in 2011 to $297,000, according to <span class="companylink">Intermountain Multiple Listing Service, Inc</span>. That is well above the means of many Boise residents, whose median household income is $52,249.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are saying, 'How am I supposed to afford a home?' " said Dana Zuckerman, chair of the Capital City Development Corp., Boise's redevelopment agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newlyweds and Boise-area locals Mike Morrow and Saira Ortiz found so few homes in their price range of about $200,000 that they ended up settling in late March for a two-bedroom townhouse for $202,000. They preferred a single-family home with a yard and more space, but lost out on one to a cash bid from a California buyer, broker T.C. Warford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The disappointment has been so great," said Ms. Ortiz, 31, an accountant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are going up too. Debbie Morrison, a leasing agent for Wright Property Management, said her company has implemented rent increases of up to 10% in the past 12 months. By comparison, rents nationally went up 2.5% over the 12-month period ending in March, according to online research firm Yardi Matrix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, once clear roads are often jammed each morning. Ms. Morrison said the 15-mile commute from her home in a Boise suburb to downtown, which two years ago took a half-hour, can now take as long as an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Shaul, research supervisor for the Idaho Department of Labor, said the growth has also led to a shortage of construction workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subcontractor Jason Woods, for example, said he runs a crew of six carpenters on jobs in the Boise area when he needs a dozen, because he simply can't find any more. Workers will jump ship to another contractor who offers to pay more, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With projections showing that Idaho could add another 200,000 people by 2025, planning experts said city and state officials will have to move quickly to keep up with infrastructure needs—namely more roads and sewage connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boise city officials say they are taking steps to address the growth issues. For example, the city is continuing to encourage more vertical housing development to take pressure off infrastructure, while working with other entities to expand mass transit and alternative modes of transportation, said a spokesman for Mayor David Bieter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime residents say the city they knew is becoming less recognizable, though some say for the better. The vacant lots that used to surround downtown are quickly filling up with hotels, a business center and grocery chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The downtown core already looks and feels vastly different from what it was when I moved to Boise 12 years ago," said Samia Islam, associate professor of economics at Boise State University. "It is more vibrant, more diverse, but it is also more crowded. You have to plan ahead for restaurant reservations now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Ms. Johansen has put her house hunting on hold until the market cools off. The nest egg of about $10,000 she saved isn't enough for her to buy anything but the very few $200,000 homes, which are going fast, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't blame people for wanting to live here," she said. "But I want to live here too."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Future of America's Economy Looks a Lot Like Elkhart, Indiana; The capital of RV manufacturing, which once had the worst unemployment rate in the U.S., is now facing labor shortages and rising home prices and wages</span>
</div><div class="author">By Bob Davis  Photographs by  David Kasnic for The Wall Street Journal </div><div>1908 words</div><div>13 April 2018</div><div>22:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chart of average weekly manufacturing wages in an earlier version of this article showed changes since the end of the recession, as correctly labeled in the callout on the chart. A headline with the chart incorrectly said the changes were from 2006. (April 13, 2018)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ELKHART, Ind.—The self-proclaimed RV capital of the world gives a glimpse of what the American economy looks like when operating at full tilt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-school students around here skip college for factory jobs that offer great pay and benefits. For-hire signs sprout like roadside weeds. And workers are so flush that car dealers can't keep new pickups on the lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the strains are showing. Employers can't hang on to employees, and house prices are zooming. The worker shortage prompted a local <span class="companylink">Kentucky Fried Chicken</span> restaurant to offer $150 signing bonuses. A <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> failed to open for lunch last fall because managers couldn't corral enough hands at $8 an hour to serve the lines waiting at the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No place in the U.S. has seen a labor-market turnaround like this metropolitan region of 110,000 workers, a mix of blue-collar whites, Mexican immigrants and Amish. "It's like 1955," said Michael Hicks, a Ball State University economist. "If you show up and have minimal literacy skills, you can find a job here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elkhart has unique economic conditions—its good fortune is tied to a central role in the revival of the recreational-vehicle market, where neither automation nor foreign competition is a threat. But as the U.S. turns the page on a decade of postcrisis underemployment, the region points to a future of labor shortages and fights over workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless rate in the Elkhart region plunged from 20% in March 2009, worst in the U.S., to just over 2% in January, half the national average. The local unemployment rate is actually closer to zero: some 9,500 jobs have no takers. Each day, about 25,000 workers commute into Elkhart city, population 50,000. A county economic development agency is hunting for job candidates across Appalachia and as far as Puerto Rico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local jobs rebound is the largest among 403 metro areas analyzed for The Wall Street Journal by Moody's Analytics. As the national unemployment rate drops toward 4%, the Elkhart region has been at that level or below for 34 consecutive months. The rest of the U.S. might never match Elkhart's sizzling pace, but the region could show what lies ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average weekly wages overall were up 6.3% in the third quarter of 2017 from a year earlier, the Labor Department said, compared with a 0.6% decline nationally over the same period. In Elkhart's RV industry, which employs 12% of local workers, average annual salaries in 2016 rose 17% to $68,000. Pay is still going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some job perks sound more Silicon Valley than Rust Belt. LCI industries, an RV parts maker, employs four "dream managers," counselors who help workers plan vacations or handle family problems. "We want people to have a deeper purpose," said one manager, John Ferguson, a former minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company, which makes shelves, advertises a free health clinic to lure new hires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chasing scarce workers has fueled inflation elsewhere. Median home prices have risen about 6.5% annually over the past two years, said Gary Decker, former president of Elkhart County's board of Realtors, about twice as fast as in past recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elkhart city, located at the junction of the St. Joseph and Elkhart rivers, is booming in a conservative Midwestern way, said Arvis Dawson, a former Elkhart city council member: "People here make enough money to buy a <span class="companylink">Cadillac</span>, but they buy Chevys."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not at Zeigler Ford. The dealership usually stocks a half-dozen Ford Expeditions, which sell for as much as $85,000, and Lincoln Navigators that top out at $95,000. In February, the pricey SUVs were sold out. The <span class="companylink">Ford</span> dealer, which usually stocks 20 to 30 top-end F-150 pickups, had three on the lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the high-line series have taken off," said Mike Simmons, a sales manager. The tight labor market has created problems in his own office, which is short a full-time worker. The dealership is making do with three part-timers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hand made</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayco Factory 44 looks like a giant woodworking shop, punctuated with the rat-tat-tat of staple guns firing and the buzz of electric saws. The site, which produces $475,000 Entegra motor homes, belongs to <span class="companylink">Thor Industries Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thor buys steel chassis, and Jayco workers build the RV housing. Workers push the 45-foot-long motor homes by hand along a rail system. The vehicles move from station to station, where specialists assemble various parts by hand: cabinets, wiring, walls and roofs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amish ride their bicycles for the 5 a.m. start of the workday and head home to farms by 1 p.m. Thor, the region's largest employer, takes extraordinary steps to locate workers. The company seeks prospects in Youngstown, Ohio, and other Midwestern cities with higher unemployment. It also hires county jail inmates in work-release programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the company invites eighth-grade students to visit its plants, and sends finished RVs to tour area grade schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RV industry sets wages at levels others find hard to match: Eight of Elkhart's 10 largest employers make RVs or RV parts. Workers are paid based on units produced. At full production, that translates to as much as $90,000 a year for assembly workers at RV plants and $100,000 for foremen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work is tough. The posting for an assembly job at LCI industries says the work "requires walking, bending, kneeling, stooping, crouching, crawling and climbing all day," plus lifting "items over 50 pounds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older workers gravitate to less demanding jobs at other RV firms that make parts and where the base pay is around $15 to $20 an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lamont Blackwell, the manager of a local <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> restaurant, said he used to work at LCI for more money. "I have thought about going back, but I can't keep up," he said. "I'm 40 years old, and my body is breaking down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees job-hop frequently in this workers' market. Turnover in the RV industry is roughly 100%, according to local manufacturers. Bonuses of $500 to $1,000 are commonly offered to new hires if they stay 90 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Collins, president of Cleer Vision Windows Inc., which makes windows for RVs, said that so few people stick around for three months that he pays a $100 bonus for finishing four weeks. The company buses in workers from out of town and generally doesn't require any pre-employment drug testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Collins also hires laborers from work-release programs. He said demand is so high that even inmates are hard to retain as workers after their release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Joblessville, USA'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elkhart metro region operates like an oil economy—a Kuwait in the cornfields—said Enrico Moretti, a <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, economist. The RV industry sets wages and standards to a level few competitors can match, making diversification difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When bad times hit, they hit hard. In 2009, RV sales fell by half, and so did RV employment. Organizers canceled the Elkhart RV show, the first time in more than 50 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of decline during the recession were stark. Mr. Collins, of Cleer Vision Windows, employed about 40 people in 2009 and wasn't hiring any more. Even so, he said, day after day, another 40 or so people lined up in his lobby and out the door, to fill out applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Independent, a British newspaper, declared Elkhart "Joblessville, USA." Elkhart school district enrollment fell by 1,000, about 7%, when families left town to find jobs, especially those from Mexico, whose population had grown from just 2% of the Elkhart City's population in 1990 to 24% by 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose Chiquito, a Goshen College sophomore, said his father and five of his siblings had moved to Elkhart over the years from the Mexican state of Aguascalientes for RV jobs. During the recession, three returned home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many who stayed in Elkhart lost their homes. More than a third of home sales in 2010 were foreclosures, said Mr. Decker, the real-estate broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When President Barack Obama put together an $800 billion stimulus plan in 2009, he traveled twice to Elkhart to illustrate the recession's despair. "We were the worst in the country," said Jason Lippert, chief executive of LCI Industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowly at first, Elkhart's economy improved. The stimulus plan helped, although some projects flopped. Three companies set up shop, got pledges of more than $50 million in government funding and produced just two working electric vehicles before folding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting around 2012, the RV industry—and, by extension, Elkhart—started to rebound sharply, largely because of the improved U.S. economy, say economists and RV industry executives. RV shipments last year tripled to 500,000 motor homes and trailers from 2009, the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelley Moore, an Elkhart urban planner, said the city has been in a "race against the clock" to build a more diverse and sustainable economy. The pursuit is complicated by the RV industry's success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs are so easy to get that fewer in the region are enrolling in college, a risky bet against another downturn. Elkhart ranks 335th of 380 metro areas in percentage residents with a college degree, the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enrollment in the Elkhart branch of Ivy Tech Community College has fallen by nearly half since the recession. "We're up against a great economy," said Kyle Hannon, executive director of the local campus. "It's kind of weird."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in good times, memories of the last recession—and fears about the next one—shape business and personal decisions in Elkhart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents squirrel away money, not sure whether to trust the boom. That makes sense, according to Mr. Hicks, the Ball State economist. In the next recession, he said, "they will be clobbered."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few RV makers want to invest in factory automation, given the industry's past peaks and valleys. Without large capital spending, "we are highly variable," said Robert Martin, Thor's CEO. "We can ramp down if things get really bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are almost no places to rent in and around Elkhart, but few builders will risk erecting homes or apartments that will sit empty in what has been a boom-and-bust economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of people with the money here to put up housing," said Mr. Lippert, the RV parts maker. But with nine years of economic recovery, he said, many say, "What if it ends next year?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Stump, who builds RVs at Jayco, said he returned to Elkhart in January after living with his family in Peoria, Ill., for 15 years where he worked at <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>. He couldn't find a rental to house his family, so he stays at a bed-and-breakfast and, on weekends, makes the 4 1/2 hour drive to Peoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing shortage has sparked "something we haven't seen in our careers here," said Mr. Decker, the real-estate broker. "Multiple offers."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Christina Rexrode </div><div>960 words</div><div>11 April 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans are stretching to buy homes, the latest sign that rising prices are making homeownership more difficult for a broad swath of potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly one in five conventional mortgage loans made this winter went to borrowers spending more than 45% of their monthly incomes on their mortgage payment and other debts, the highest proportion since the housing crisis, according to new data from mortgage-data tracker <span class="companylink">CoreLogic Inc</span>. That was almost triple the proportion of such loans made in 2016 and the first half of 2017, Core-Logic said. That comes as mortgage-finance companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> have been backing more of these loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said rising debt levels are a symptom of a market in which home prices are rising sharply in relation to incomes, driven in part by a historic lack of supply that is forcing prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents worry that with buyers being priced out of the market, this could be one of the weakest spring selling seasons in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are becoming more optimistic about the economy and their personal financial prospects but less hopeful that now is the right time to buy a home, according to results of a survey released in late March by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has risen to 4.40% as of last week from 3.95% at the beginning of the year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, putting still more pressure on affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These factors "are working against affordability and that's why you get the pressure to ease credit standards," said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae. He said that pressure has to be balanced against the potential toll if underqualified buyers eventually default on mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> studied home-purchase loans that generally meet standards set by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The mortgage-finance companies don't make loans but instead buy them from lenders and package them into securities that are sold to other investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of these loans sold by Fannie and Freddie increased 73% in the second half of 2017 compared with the first half of the year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. Fannie accounted for the bulk of that growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that same period, overall new mortgages rose 15%. Fannie and Freddie backed nearly half of all U.S. mortgage dollars originated in 2017, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie have been experimenting with how to make homeownership more affordable, including backing loans made by lenders who agree to help pay down a buyer's student debt or making it easier for self-employed borrowers to get mortgages. Several years ago, Fannie and Freddie started guaranteeing loans with down payments as low as 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sohani Rao, a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area, tried to buy a home for about a year but finally gave up a few months ago. Dozens of prospective buyers would show up for open houses, she said, even for homes in poor condition, resulting in bidding wars that put them out of her price range. Ms. Rao said loosening lending standards would only create more bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are so bad right now," she said. "By doing this, they might have even made the problem worse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt-to-income ratios measure the share of a household's pretax income that goes to paying a potential mortgage, plus credit-card payments, student loans and other debt. Borrowers who find themselves saddled with too much debt might struggle to make their monthly mortgage payment or save for major repairs or other emergencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Todd Jones, president of BBMC Mortgage, said he is wary of making loans to borrowers whose debt-to-income levels would rise above 45% as a result, because they could find themselves stretched. "Every month is going to be tight," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> started to back more loans made to borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of up to 50%, up from a typical limit of 45%. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also began backing more of those loans, according to industry researchers. Fannie's new policy has resulted in 100,000 new mortgages that otherwise wouldn't have been made last year and early this year, according to the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Caliber Home Loans</span>, a Texas-based lender, said 25% of its funded loans have debt-to-income ratios of greater than 45%, up from 10% about a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn that lenders must tread carefully in making credit more available, given the role easy mortgages played in creating the last housing bubble. The share of new buyers with debt-to-income levels in the 46%-to-50% range remains well below the peak of just under 37% registered in 2007, but is nearing the levels of 2004-05, the years leading up to the bubble, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, lenders are making most of these loans to borrowers who have a history of good credit. In the fourth quarter of last year, about 78% of the loans with debt-to-income ratios above 45% were made to borrowers with credit scores of 700 or more, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Although standards vary by lender, usually any mortgage borrower below 650 is considered subprime, or those with a checkered or limited credit history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem," said Guy Cecala, chief executive of Inside Mortgage Finance, "is you're going to run out of [prime] borrowers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mezzanine provider Yukon Partners is partnering with Sorenson Capital and Webster Capital to recapitalize Home Brands Group Holdings Inc., a franchiser of residential bathroom remodeling services that does business as Re-Bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yukon provided mezzanine capital and acquired a minority equity interest in the business, according to a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1978, franchisees of Phoenix-based Re-Bath provide design services on the design of new bathrooms. Then Re-Bath demolishes and installs the new bathroom, typically taking three to five days to do so, according to the release. The company makes its own product line as well as using various national brands in its installation projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company franchises its remodeling services in more than 150 U.S. cities, according to the release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorenson, which along with Webster took a majority stake in the company in 2009, said the new capital would help enable the business to expand into new geographic markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yukon Partners, of Minneapolis, provides junior capital primarily to midmarket private equity-backed deals in the U.S. and Canada, typically investing $10 million to $50 million in each transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Webster backs branded consumer and health-care services companies with $3 million to $15 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stone Point Capital has acquired a majority stake in American Mortgage Consultants Inc., a provider of outsourced services to participants in the residential- and consumer-loan mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1996, American Mortgage provides residential and consumer mortgage loan due diligence, quality control, securitization review, mortgage servicing rights review, advance assessment, servicing oversight, technology and consulting services.

</div><div class="author">By Shefali Anand </div><div>898 words</div><div>4 April 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, as some of the biggest names in U.S. real estate built empires of rental apartment buildings, the business in the U.K. mostly was limited to mom-and-pop landlords with no more than a few dozen units each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, major global institutions are jumping into the game as U.K. living habits change and investors search for higher yields in an aging bull market in commercial real estate. Demand for rentals also is increasing as shortages of affordable housing become more acute in the U.K., matching markets in other parts of Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of professionally managed rental apartments in the U.K. increased to 19,000 at the end of 2017 from 4,000 in 2014, according to research from the <span class="companylink">British Property Federation</span>, a real-estate industry association. An additional 86,000 such homes are either under construction or in planning, the federation said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors had spent $21 billion on these U.S.-style rentals as of 2016, according to <span class="companylink">Knight Frank LLP</span>, a real-estate consulting firm. That number is expected to swell to about $100 billion by 2022, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think there's a lot of pent-up demand," said Simon Harding-Roots, executive director, major projects, at property developer Grosvenor Britain &amp; Ireland. "London desperately needs it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grosvenor's plans include a 1,350-home rental complex in Bermondsey, a neighborhood in southeast London, at a site that previously was home to a biscuit factory. With an initial investment of GBP 500 million ($702 million), the project will include a range of apartments, from studios to three-bedroom units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some foreign-capital sources have broken into the U.K. market by teaming up with domestic companies. In 2016, PGGM, a Dutch pension-fund service provider that manages $270 billion of assets, tied up with U.K. asset manager <span class="companylink">Legal &amp; General</span> Capital to initially invest GBP 600 million to build more than 3,000 units of U.K. rental housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other foreign investors include <span class="companylink">Patrizia Immobilien AG</span> of Germany. Also, a venture of international property company Lendlease Corp., based in Australia, and the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span> announced a venture in January to build rental housing with an initial investment target of GBP 1.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, big participants in the U.S. apartment rental market are showing up, hoping to re-create their success. South Carolina-based Greystar Real Estate Partners, a major operator of rental apartments in the U.S., is building a 1,965-home site in west London, among other projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. is behind the U.S. in rental apartment development partly because the country has a high rate of homeownership. Moreover, builders in the U.K. historically have preferred to construct homes for sale, because they can reap returns much faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after years of escalating prices, many are finding houses unaffordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home price in the U.K. rose 35% in the five-year period ended in January, while the average price rose about 55% in London during the period, according to data from the U.K.'s Land Registry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people in the U.K. are opting to rent as a lifestyle choice because they don't want to be tied down to one place. This gives investors the confidence that there will be long-term renters who won't be rushing to buy a home when they have more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, everybody understands that this is actually a structural demand for purpose-built rental property," said James Muir, U.K. country head for Patrizia, which has invested GBP 625 million to build 2,200 rental homes in Ireland and the U.K., including in London, Manchester and Birmingham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies that previously built homes only for sale are now turning to rental construction. "We've switched because the for-sale market is increasingly out of reach for the majority of London's population," said Angus Dodd, chief executive officer of Quintain Ltd., a U.K. developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quintain is building one of the largest rental-apartment complexes in the country, in Wembley Park, a district in the London region, with nearly 3,000 units under construction. The developer's change in strategy was partly driven by its largest shareholder, U.S. private-equity firm <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quintain's rentals range from studios to three-bedroom apartments, and the buildings have shared living spaces including resident lounges and landscaped gardens. A typical two-bedroom apartment from Quintain rents for GBP 2,000 a month, according to the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the rental-apartment business isn't without its risks. Several developers have focused on building upscale apartments that need to charge high rents, and they run the possibility of missing the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real depth of the market is in the middle market," said Peter Wyatt, residential development partner at Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government regulation, however, can be tricky. London, for example, has proposed that 35% of all new housing development be "affordable," meaning below-market prices, to qualify for a fast-track route through the planning process. Developers say this number is too high.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjustable-rate mortgages are more beneficial for borrowers and the housing market during a financial crisis than fixed-rate mortgages, according to a paper[http://www.nber.org.proxy.library.brocku.ca/papers/w24446] by Adam Guren of <span class="companylink">Boston University</span> and Timothy McQuade and Arvind Krishnamurthy of <span class="companylink">Stanford University</span>. Comparing the two types of mortgages in a market scenario similar to the 2008 crisis, the researchers found that with adjustable-rate mortgages, house prices fell less and fewer households defaulted. The lower default rate "short-circuits the equilibrium price-default spiral and leads to a less-severe housing crisis," they write.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to grow at a rapid pace in the first month of 2018, as the new tax law and rising mortgage rates made little dent in demand in the early weeks of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures the price of a typical single-family home in major metropolitan areas across the country, rose 6.2% in January, down slightly from a 6.3% year-over-year increase reported for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 6% over the year, unchanged from the prior month. The 20-city index gained 6.4%, up slightly from 6.3% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The home-price surge continues," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price gains picked up steam in 2017 from 2016. The national Case-Shiller index is now 6.3% above the peak reached in the housing bubble in 2006. Home prices fell to a bottom in 2012, before matching that peak again in late 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are continuing to grow about twice as fast as incomes, despite a strengthening economy, which is making it difficult for millennials to break into the market and buy their first homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are racing ahead of worker earnings and this will prove to [be] unsustainable over the longer run, and we are keeping our fingers crossed this latest bubble in housing prices won't end with a bang again like it did over a decade ago," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Mr. Rupkey noted that prices were rising in the mid-double digits in the mid-2000s before the bubble burst so the gains appear to be more sustainable today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the pace of price growth to slow this year, because of the new tax law that reduced the incentive for homeownership, as well as rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that are seeing the steepest increases remain concentrated in the West. Seattle reported the largest annual gain, at 12.9%, followed by Las Vegas at 11.1%. San Francisco, which had seen price growth drop out of the double digits, rebounded with a 10.2% gain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are continuing to grow about twice as fast as incomes, despite a strengthening economy, which is making it difficult for millennials to break into the market and buy their first homes. Average hourly earning for private sector workers rose just 2.6% in the year ended in February, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are racing ahead of worker earnings and this will prove to unsustainable over the longer run, and we are keeping our fingers crossed this latest bubble in housing prices won't end with a bang again like it did over a decade ago," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Mr. Rupkey noted that prices were rising in the mid-double digits in the mid-2000s before the bubble burst so the gains appear to be more sustainable today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the pace of price growth to slow this year, due to a new tax law that passed in late December that reduced the incentive for homeownership [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gop-tax-overhaul-makes-homeownership-less-appealing-1513765800], as well as rising mortgage rates that make owning a home less affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates are expected to be a significant new challenge [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homeowners-ditch-refinancings-as-mortgage-rates-rise-1522062001] to the market this year and could ultimately slow the pace of price gains by making homes less affordable. The rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.22% by the beginning of February, up from 3.95% at the beginning of January, according to mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Last Thursday, Freddie reported that mortgage rates were up to 4.45%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of both new and existing home sales have largely slowed in recent months, though existing home sales rebounded in February. Existing-home sales increased 3% in February from the previous month after posting declines in the two prior months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that are seeing the steepest increases remain concentrated in the West. Seattle reported the largest annual gain, at 12.9%, followed by Las Vegas at 11.1%. San Francisco, which had seen price growth drop out of the double digits, rebounded with a 10.2% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. index rose 0.05% in January before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index both rose 0.3% from December to January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.5% month-over-month. The 10-city index rose 0.7% and the 20-city index rose 0.8%. All 20 cities saw price increases after seasonal adjustment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are few, if any, really weak spots," Mr. Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential weak spot, economists said, is the high end of the market, which is underperforming the rest of the market. Prices for starter homes, meanwhile, are growing faster than the overall market. Out of the 17 cities for which the low price-tier home prices are available, home prices have grown by an average of 10.6% over the past 12 months, compared with 6.8% for the total market, according to Genworth Mortgage Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is robust demand by first-time home buyers for affordable homes, and equally robust supply for higher-end homes," said Tian Liu, chief economist for Genworth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPITAL SPENDING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable-Goods Orders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revved Up Last Month</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for long-lasting U.S. factory goods rose in February at the best rate in eight months, supported by an uptick in business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods -- products designed to last at least three years, such as industrial robots and refrigerators -- increased 3.1% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $247.72 billion in February, the Commerce Department said. The bigger-than-expected gain was the largest since June 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A closely watched proxy for business investment, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, rose 1.8% in February -- the best gain since September -- to $67.83 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the highest level of such capital spending since 2014, when a booming energy sector stoked investment in gas- and oil-extraction equipment. The latest figure is a rebound for the category, which had declined the prior two months after solid gains in much of 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report showed some improvement for the supply of new homes, which has been tight recently and has contributed to a run-up in home prices. At the current sales pace, there was a 5.9-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of February, the highest level since August and well above last February's 5.1-month supply. Still, supply remains tight by historical comparisons. The median sale price for a new home sold in February was $326,800, up 9.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand for new homes should continue to rise with a solid job market, modestly accelerating wages, and positive demographics," said David Berson, Nationwide chief economist. "The impact of rising demand and constrained supply will be another year of strong price gains."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on new-home sales can be choppy from month to month, and February's 0.6% decline came with a margin of error of 13.3 percentage points. More broadly, sales rose 0.5% through the 12 months ended in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes reached a postrecession high in November, but they have settled lower since and remain well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. housing starts declined in February, returning to a long-term trend of modest improvement in single-family construction and a slowdown in apartment building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total housing starts fell 7% in February from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.236 million, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily construction plummeted 26.1% in February, after activity in this segment increased robustly in January. Single-family starts, meanwhile, rose 2.9% compared with a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was really a story about the fact that we're seeing a return to…a gradual, modest growth trend" on the single-family side, said Robert Dietz, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, declined 5.7% to an annual pace of 1.298 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Friday's 7% fall for starts came with a margin of error of 16.7 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term trend has been one of modest improvement in single-family building and declines in multifamily construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-to-date housing starts are up 3.5% compared with the same period last year. Single-family starts rose 7.8% during that period and starts for buildings with five or more units were down 5.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have been shifting back toward owning after a decadelong trend favoring renting. The homeownership rate rose in 2017 for the [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homeownership-rate-rises-in-2017-for-first-time-since-2004-1517334537]  first time since 2004 [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/homeownership-rate-rises-in-2017-for-first-time-since-2004-1517334537].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, even as demand for multifamily housing has tapered, there is a glut of high-end apartments in urban centers. Together, these trends have prompted many builders to pull back on multifamily construction while single-family builders are gradually ramping up production, although they still face stiff headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz said he is predicting only a 5% increase in single-family starts this year and a slight decline in multifamily starts, due in part to the tax bill that is expected to cause a slowdown in higher-cost housing markets. Material shortages and a lack of construction workers are major challenges for builders as they try to build more homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Softwood lumber prices have risen 60% since the beginning of 2016, Mr. Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building has held near the highest levels since before the recession began, although it remains significantly below normal levels when adjusting for population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bright spot for home buyers is that housing completions were up some 7.8% in February compared with a month earlier. That could help ease some of the shortage of homes for sale during the critical spring selling season, although many of those homes are already sold.</p>

</div><div class="author">By David Harrison </div><div>1051 words</div><div>8 March 2018</div><div>22:53</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peterson Institute for International Economics was incorrectly called Peterson Institute of International Economics in an earlier version of this article. (March 8, 2018)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Donald Trump burnished his tough-on-trade image last week by declaring he would impose tariffs [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-wont-quickly-announce-new-tariffs-on-aluminum-steel-1519921704] on U.S. steel and aluminum imports. But the move could undermine another part of his "America First" economic agenda: Rebuilding U.S. infrastructure [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/white-house-to-roll-out-trump-infrastructure-plan-1518386400].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tariffs on imported aluminum and steel could drive up the cost of infrastructure investments, accentuating price pressures already brought on by a growing global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, an improved economic outlook around the world has raised demand for globally traded products used in construction, such as oil or steel. Higher demand in the U.S., meanwhile, has propped up prices for concrete and other materials, making it more expensive to build roads, bridges, schools, health centers and other facilities when U.S. infrastructure is rapidly aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department's producer-price index for goods used in construction industries—which include asphalt, concrete, diesel fuel and other materials—was up 4.9% year-to-year in January. In November, prices were up 5.6% on an annual basis, the steepest increase in seven years. A separate producer-price index for steel-mill products was up 7.8% in 2017, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those price increases outpace overall economic growth—2.5% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier—and consumer price inflation, which stood at 2.1% in January over the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's an indication that industrial demand is picking up both domestically and globally," said Ken Simonson, chief economist at Associated General Contractors, an industry group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now economists don't expect proposed tariffs to have a big impact on the broader $19.7 trillion U.S. economy. Steel and aluminum together account for just 1.6% of U.S. imports and 0.2% of economic output, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span> economists. The impact could become more severe if tariffs spark a broader trade war. Even if limited to metals, construction industries [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/infrastructure-plan-falls-flat-for-investors-1518777001] could be especially exposed, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Iron and Steel Institute</span> estimates that 43% of U.S. steel consumption goes to the construction industry.​In 2005, the latest figures available, the Transportation Department estimated [https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/ohim/hs04/pdf/pt4.pdf] that highway construction uses 56 tons of steel for every million dollars in project costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem is that the steel-producing sector is a small share of the economy while steel consumption is present almost across the board," he said. "The construction sector is certainly a big consumer of steel and that is one of the paradoxes of this type of policy: You think you're really helping the economy but in the end you're shooting yourself in the foot because the pain you inflict on the consuming sectors is greater than the benefit you're giving to the producing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, wholesale prices for primary metals in the U.S. went from near 4% deflation to 4% inflation, according to Labor Department data. The tariffs were responsible for a 3% increase in costs and were "extremely disruptive to U.S. firms that rely on steel imports to make consumer goods," concluded a 2003 review of Mr. Bush's move by the <span class="companylink">Peterson Institute for International Economics</span>. Mr. Bush reversed the tariffs in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration has proposed spending $200 billion to pay for more than $1 trillion over a decade in infrastructure projects using matching funds [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trumps-infrastructure-plan-counts-on-states-to-do-heavy-lifting-1518400800] from state and local governments or the private sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you talk about any increase in project costs or materials prices when you don't have revenue sources that are keeping pace with those project costs, you're ultimately going to be able to perform less work," said Alison Premo Black, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">American Road and Transportation Builders Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bridges rely heavily on steel. The new Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River in New York by itself will use 220 million pounds of steel when finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding tariffs on top of the existing price pressures could make new state and local projects less likely, said David Stueckler, president and chief executive of Linbeck, a construction firm in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are equipped to deal with normal levels of price fluctuations but something like a tariff could put increases into the range that are very difficult for us or owners to deal with," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tarrant County, Texas, officials have spent the past two years cultivating public support for an $800 million bond issue to finance a new public hospital while watching nervously as rising construction costs threatened to push up the building's price tag, said Roy C. Brooks, a county commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To the extent that the price of steel goes up, then every project that uses steel will go up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commissioners in Douglas County, Neb., which includes Omaha, are planning new public safety facilities but are concerned cost increases could hold the project back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're a little bit worried about building in terms of the cost," said Mary Ann Borgeson, a county commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steel tariffs could also hit energy producers and hurt the administration's goal of making the U.S. energy independent, industry groups say. Much of the steel used in pipelines is imported and domestic manufacturers don't produce enough to meet the industry's need, according to the Association of Oil Pipe Lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry, meanwhile, is grappling with tariffs on softwood lumber imposed last year that could boost home prices this year. Lumber futures have hit records on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> estimates the tariffs will result in about 9,400 construction jobs lost while raising the price of the average single-family home by $1,360.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christina Rexrode and Laura Kusisto </div><div>1010 words</div><div>9 March 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. mortgage rates have hit their highest level since 2014, a new challenge for a housing market that has been central to the economic recovery but remains vulnerable to even modest headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.46%, the highest in more than four years and the ninth consecutive week of increases, according to data Thursday from mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. At the start of the year, the average rate was 3.95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend persists, it could hamper a sector that represents about 15% of U.S. gross-domestic product. Rising mortgage rates already have crimped refinancing activity and pushed would-be home buyers who are on the margins out of the market as home prices also have risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is almost like a double whammy for the borrower," said Pete Boomer, head of mortgage production at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates already have made some current homeowners less likely to move, creating a bottleneck throughout the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Rutkowski and Erin Wilder recently considered leaving their Long Island, N.Y., home east of New York City to find a place with more room for their three boys, but decided instead to renovate. They bought their house in 2012, with a mortgage that had a rate of 3.75%, and know they couldn't get the same deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A couple of tenths of a percentage point on a mortgage could easily swing your decision," said Mr. Rutkowski, who is an attorney at an insurance company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rates remain low by historical standards, millennial buyers, who are often making their first home purchase, could suffer sticker shock. "They will be the preponderance of the market purchasing homes over the next 10 years," said Ed Robinson, head of the mortgage business at <span class="companylink">Fifth Third Bancorp</span>. "And they've never seen 5%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A continued increase in home prices has been a sign of strength for the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent months, home-sales activity has dropped sharply amid low inventory levels, tax-code changes and buyers' growing weariness from being priced out of the market. Economists say the rise in rates poses a particular challenge because it comes as prices have shot up so quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the bright lights has been low rates and that bright light is dimming a bit," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates this year have risen faster than economists expected, but their increase was steeper in two recent cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the so called taper tantrum in 2013, when investors anticipated that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> would pull back from its bond-buying program, rates rose from 3.35% in early May to 4.51% in July. The pace of sales of existing homes then declined 8% from July to December 2013, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, the housing market largely weathered a rise in rates that followed the November 2016 presidential election, in part because the election boosted consumer confidence in many parts of the country. Rates for a 30-year mortgage rose from about 3.5% before the election to 4.3% by the end of that year. The pace of home sales from December 2016 to May 2017 held steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rates eventually retreated after the taper tantrum and the 2016 election, economists now expect them to remain at least at current levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, the housing market often does well when mortgage rates rise. Potential buyers may hurry to complete purchases before rates rise further. Rising rates often signal underlying confidence in the broader economy, which could make some people more apt to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cody Moss, a 26-year-old mortgage banker, said the rise in rates has prompted him and his girlfriend to speed up the search for their first home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now there seems to be added pressure because it is such an appreciating market as far the [prices] go and an appreciating market as far as the rates go," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are looking for a one- or two-bedroom condo in the $200,000 to $300,000 range in or near the Lincoln Park area in Chicago. So far, they are only likely to pay $15 to $25 more a month based on the recent increase in mortgage rates, but Mr. Moss still worries whether rates will continue going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The urgency is definitely there, but at the same token you don't want to just purchase something willy-nilly and not be satisfied with it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, there is little correlation between the level of the increases that recently have occurred with mortgage rates and declines in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It takes a pretty big rise in mortgage rates to offset the strength in the economy that causes rates to rise," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former chief economist at Fannie Mae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect renters who want to become homeowners will still try to do so, although they may have to look for cheaper homes or make other spending changes. Economists believe mortgage rates would have to rise to roughly 6% before they start to significantly affect borrowers' decisions about whether to buy a home or what they can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in higher-cost markets, such as New York City and San Francisco, higher rates can have a bigger effect given that loan balances are larger. A 3.5% rate on a $500,000 loan would create a monthly payment of $2,245, according to <span class="companylink">LendingTree Inc</span>., an online loan information site. At 4.5%, the monthly payment would be $2,533. (That excludes taxes and insurance.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates tend to have a bigger impact on the market for refinancing existing mortgages. <span class="companylink">The Mortgage Bankers Association</span> expects mortgage-purchase originations to increase about 7% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It forecasts the refinancing market, which is smaller, to plunge by nearly 28%, adding to a sharp drop in 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' wealth pushed further into record territory in the final quarter of last year, hitting nearly $100 trillion thanks to rising stock markets [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/stocks-still-have-momentum-as-aging-bull-market-turns-9-1520571660] and property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household net worth—the value of all assets such as stocks and real estate minus liabilities like mortgage and credit-card debt—rose more than $2 trillion last quarter to a record $98.746 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. households also saw their net worth rise to nearly seven times their disposable personal income in 2017, swelling past earlier prerecession peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of wealth to income is "at pretty dizzying levels right now," JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the rate at which Americans are saving is "a little worrying," he said. The saving rate was 3.74% for 2017, down from 5.98% a year earlier and 7.19% in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous busts—in the early and late 2000s—were preceded by periods of rising asset values and low saving, and the current wealth-to-income level surpasses that seen in the run-up to earlier recessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household wealth hit a level of just over six times disposable income in the first quarter of 2000, a year before the economy tipped into recession when a tech-stock bubble burst. Wealth touched 651.8% of disposable income in the first quarter of 2006, less than two years before the souring housing boom triggered a recession that began in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, household debt hasn't run up as fast in this cycle as it did in the 2000s, and stock valuations aren't as high this cycle as in the 1990s stock boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report underscored the extent to which rising stock and real-estate prices are boosting household wealth, as the current economic expansion nears its ninth anniversary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks had a banner year in 2017, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 19% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 25%. Household wealth in the stock market climbed by $1.346 trillion in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the value of households' real estate increased $511.2 billion, reflecting continuing increases in home prices. U.S. house prices rose 1.6% in the fourth quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s house price index, and rose 6.7% on the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the buffer from home equity, households also have $9.272 trillion in deposits, which include checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly Fed report, known as the flow of funds, presents its data only in aggregate, providing no details on how assets are distributed among households. It tracks the aggregate wealth of all U.S. households and nonprofit organizations, although nonprofits make up a relatively small proportion of household wealth. The figures aren't adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate data from the Fed suggests the gap between the wealthy and others has continued to widen in recent years. The share of wealth held by the top 1% rose to 39% in 2016, up from 30% in 1989, according to the Fed's survey of consumer finances [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-families-wealth-incomes-rose-fed-survey-says-1506534336], which is conducted every three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household debts rose at an annual rate of 5.2% in the fourth quarter, with liabilities increasing by $208.6 billion. Borrowing has continued to climb even as the Fed has been gradually raising short-term interest rates, making mortgages, home-equity lines and other loans more expensive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is booming, take-home pay is rising and millennials are getting married and having children. Despite all those homebuying catalysts, real-estate agents said this could be one of the weakest spring selling seasons in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The culprits: rising mortgage rates, a new tax law that reduces the incentives for homeownership and a growing weariness among first-time buyers being priced out of the market -- all of which are expected to damp demand for homes this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next few months are a critical test of the housing market, as buyers look to get into contract before summer vacations and the new school year. About 40% of the year's sales take place from March through June, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales volumes expected to be lackluster this year, the relentless price increases of the past few years could lose some steam. That could present opportunities for hardy buyers willing to brave rising interest rates, but make it slightly more difficult for sellers in some pricey markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still going to be a tight market, but we're moving from an extremely tight market to one that has some wiggle room around the edges for buyers," said Daren Blomquist, a senior vice president at the housing-research firm Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said he expects sales to be flat this spring from a year earlier. About 2.06 million homes were sold between March and June 2017, up from about 2 million in the same period a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun has predicted sales will remain flat for all of 2018 due to inventory shortages and eroding affordability, as both prices and mortgage rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence in the housing market fell in February, according to data released Wednesday by mortgage company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. The share of respondents who said now is a good time to buy a home decreased 5 percentage points from January, due to concerns about stock market volatility and rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, existing home sales suffered their sharpest annual drop in three years, falling 4.8% from a year earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales, an indicator of activity in the months to come, dipped 4.7% in January to their lowest level in more than three years, according to the Realtors. The median price, meanwhile, rose 5.8% from a year ago -- the 71st straight month of annual gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top end of the market is slowing across the U.S., in part because of the tax overhaul, which capped the mortgage-interest deduction as well as state and local tax deductions, disproportionately affecting higher-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A homeowner with a median-priced home in the San Francisco area will receive $4,500 less in housing-related tax benefits in the first year of a 30-year mortgage this year, according to real-estate data company <span class="companylink">Apartment List</span>. A homeowner in the same position in the New York metro area would receive $1,500 less annually. Chicago broker Bruce Glazer said both the high and low ends of the market are softening there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weakness at the high end is being driven by stock-market volatility and the $10,000 cap the tax law placed on deducting state and local property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the low end, buyers are being priced out of the market by rising interest rates, Mr. Glazer said. The rate for a 30-year mortgage has risen about half a percentage point this year to 4.43% from 3.95% in early January. For the median-priced U.S. home that translates to about $55 more a month, but in higher-cost markets the difference can be steeper.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lumber shortage has pushed prices to record highs as builders stock up for what is expected to be one of the busiest construction seasons in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders in the U.S. say the higher lumber costs are making homes more expensive. Lumber prices started rising last year after fires destroyed prime forests  [https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/canadian-wildfires-choke-lumber-supply-to-u-s-home-builders-1500721204]and a trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada restricted supplies. Now a shortage of railcars  [https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/a-shortage-of-trucks-is-forcing-companies-to-cut-shipments-or-pay-up-1516789800]and trucks is forcing builders to pay even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in a lumber supply crisis," said Stinson Dean, a broker in Kansas City, Mo., who ships wood from sawmills to lumber yards, in a note to clients. "None of us have experienced a market like this."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Towne of Classic Homes, which builds midrange to high-end houses in Colorado Springs, Colo., said he is spending $8,500 more on lumber for a typical home than a year ago, an increase of almost 40%. The company's passing on about half the cost to buyers for now while it waits to see if lumber prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hate to give large increases all at once because it can freeze your market," Mr. Towne said. High lumber costs added about $3,000 to the price of a newly constructed home he purchased himself in Castle Rock, Colo., late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising as lumber yards prepare for what figures to be a busy building season this spring. A strong economy and tight supply of houses are heating up the home-building market. The number of new units under construction in the U.S. rose almost 10% in January, the Commerce Department said, as strong demand  [https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https://blogs-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2018/02/21/the-housing-market-is-riding-high-once-again///]kept builders working through the winter. Permits for new homes, a sign of anticipated construction, also rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Material prices now rival labor shortages as builders' main concerns, a <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> survey showed in January. Prices for common building varieties of wood like spruce and southern pine are at or near records, according to price-tracking publication Random Lengths. March-dated lumber futures at the <span class="companylink">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span> hit a record of $532.60 per 1,000 board feet last week after climbing more than 50% in 14 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That run-up began with a trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada, which provides about a third of U.S. timber, leaving many dealers hesitant to restock at elevated prices. The Trump administration eventually instituted tariffs of 20% [https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-sets-final-tariffs-for-canadian-softwood-lumber-1509639965?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=5] or more on Canadian sawmills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems mounted. The worst wildfires on record hit Canada's Pacific Coast. Hurricane Irma temporarily closed mills in the forests of Florida and Georgia. And then came a shortage of railcars and trucks to transport timber from forests in regions like the Pacific Northwest. Rates for flatbed trucks rose 24% in January from a year earlier, according to DAT Solutions LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forestry company <span class="companylink">Canfor Corp</span>. said lumber shipments fell almost 10% in the final quarter of 2017, partly due to bad weather in western Canada. The transportation bottlenecks have caused weeks of delays, frustrating customers already paying record prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are screaming for their wood," said Russell Taylor, managing director for Canada at analysis firm Forest Economic Advisors LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Franklin Building Supply</span> in Boise, Idaho, ran out of a type of lumber used in walls, flooring and roofs one day in February for the first time in years. Rick Lierz, who runs the supplier, said one shipment of wood he was waiting for was stuck on a rail car just 20 miles away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His employees drove to local <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. stores to buy the lumber needed to fill orders for builders due that day. <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> recently told investors that rising lumber sales and prices contributed to higher earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cardinal rule when you're a supplier is you don't run out of what you need to supply," Mr. Lierz said. "It's like an ice cream shop running out of chocolate."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to rise rapidly in the waning days of 2017, but there are early signs that price gains that have well outstripped wages and inflation could begin to ease this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which covers the entire nation, rose 6.3% in December, up from a 6.1% year-over-year increase reported for November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 6% over the year, unchanged from November. The 20-city index gained 6.3%, down slightly from 6.4% the previous month. That was in line with the expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the 20-city index to rise 6.3% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price gains accelerated in 2017 compared with 2016, when prices grew more in the 5% range. Nonetheless, the pace of both new and existing home sales have slowed in recent months, which could ultimately put pressure on sellers to lower prices, especially as interest rates are beginning to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is too early to tell if the housing recovery is slowing. If it is, some moderation in price gains could be seen later this year," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that are seeing the steepest increases remain concentrated in the West. Seattle reported the largest annual gain, at 12.7%, followed by Las Vegas at 11.1%. San Francisco, which had seen price increases slow until recently, reported the third-strongest gain, at 9.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. index rose 0.2% in December before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city and the 20-city index also both rose 0.2% from November to December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.7% month-over-month and the 10-city index and 20-city index both rose 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities saw price increases after seasonal adjustment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Two months of steep declines in sales of new homes across the U.S. haven't persuaded many economists that the housing market is turning lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes -- a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- fell 7.8% in January after dropping 7.6% in December, according to data released Monday by the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases have declined for four of the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January drop bucked the 4.0% growth economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are pointing to weather and the volatile nature of the new-home sales data to explain away what could be seen as an emerging downtrend in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the drop in January were related primarily to economic factors, it is likely that all regions would have experienced declines," Nationwide chief economist David Berson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the declines were concentrated in the Northeast and South. Winter weather, particularly in Southern states, might have kept prospective buyers from the search, some economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of the weather's impact on home buyers, the numbers themselves tend to be unreliable in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home-sales data produced by the Commerce Department are highly volatile, with large statistical margins of error, and subject to extensive revisions months after initial data are released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The national and all four regional sales estimates were statistically insignificant," said Patrick Newport, IHS Markit executive director for U.S. economics.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But inventory might be turning. In January, at the current sales pace, new-home supply reached 6.1 months, the highest level since the middle of 2014. That could ease upward pressure on prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is slowing, and pressures will only build as the year goes on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned, or existing, homes slumped last month. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Wednesday that existing-home sales in January fell 3.2% from December, versus the gain economists expected to see. Sales were 4.8% below their year-earlier level, marking the biggest annual decline since August 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NAR</span> suggested tight inventories were to blame, and some economists also noted that bad weather may have delayed some sale closings. These might have affected January sales, but the bigger pressures hitting the housing market will play out this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are getting pricier -- a consequence of fewer homes, and the wrong types of homes in the wrong locations, being on sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while they probably didn't affect January home sales, higher mortgage rates could hurt future sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.38% during the week ended Feb. 15, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, a level it has only briefly been higher than over the past five years. If Treasury yields continue to climb, mortgage rates could go higher still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax cut also will hit the market. Home buyers will have more cash in their pockets, but they won't be able to deduct as much mortgage interest as in the past, reducing the advantage of home ownership over renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some powerful positives out there for the housing market, including an improving economy, rising wages and a mass of renters who would like to buy. But high prices and rising rates could end up mattering more.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned U.S. homes in January experienced their sharpest annual drop in more than three years as low inventories and rising prices and interest rates took a toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Existing-home sales fell [https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-slip-32-percent-in-january] 3.2% in January from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists had expected sales to improve modestly last month after sales also declined in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales in January were down 4.8%, the steepest annual decline since August 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks are looking at these ... hot markets. Prices are going up, there are fierce battles and all these homes are going for more than the asking price," said Alex Villacorta, executive vice president of HouseCanary, a housing data and analytics startup. "If you have a home at a really good mortgage rate, you're less inclined to give that up to get into a market that feels like 2004."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop was surprising given that pending home sales increased slightly over the past two months, which typically predicts an uptick in existing home sales. David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, said this might partly reflect buyers who experienced "rate shock" when mortgage rates rose and they were unable to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate nationwide for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed roughly a quarter of a percentage point to 4.22% by the beginning of February from 3.95% at the beginning of January, according to mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates on Thursday stood at 4.38%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Borrowing costs still remain low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still think we will see the job market and demographics overcome the rise in mortgage rates and give some upward movement in home sales, but much less than in the past because the number of homes for sale is so small," Mr. Berson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax-code overhaul passed in December limited deductibility of very large mortgages as well as state and local taxes, including property-tax bills. Mr. Yun said tax reform doesn't appear to be denting home sales yet, as buying activity remains strong in expensive regions and prospective buyers expressed limited concern to their Realtors, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of available houses on the market has driven up prices in many regions. There was a 3.4 month-supply of homes on the market at the end of January, based on the current sales pace. Total housing inventory declined in January from a year earlier to 1.52 million existing homes for sale, the lowest January count since 1999 when the agency began tracking the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the year, strong home sales seemed to be "defying gravity" given low levels of inventory. "That's clearly been exhausted now," said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at home-listings website Zillow. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are converging to buttress demand. The national unemployment rate in January was 4.1%, holding at a 17-year low. Gauges of household confidence remain elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But limited inventory on the market is driving up home prices at a rapid pace, potentially blocking some would-be buyers. The median sale price for an existing home in January was $240,500, up 5.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In several of the largest metropolitan areas, a household making a typical salary would have to spend more than 30% of their income—a level that economists consider financially sustainable—to afford the median home payment, according to HouseCanary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the fastest-growing and priciest metropolitan areas, affordability barriers are much steeper. A typical buyer in San Francisco, for example, would need to spend 75% of household income to afford a home.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ben Eisen </div><div>766 words</div><div>21 February 2018</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is heating up, providing another pillar of support for the stock market and U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders exchange-traded fund, which holds shares of home-builder companies and other housing-related firms, has climbed 20% over the past 12 months, topping the S&amp;P 500's 16% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite paring gains recently alongside a broader market selloff, some individual companies are faring particularly well. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. is up 48% over the past 12 months, <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. has jumped 30% and <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> is up 38%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of home builders, related stocks are outperforming, including home-improvement supplies retailer <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. The company's shares slid 0.1% Tuesday, falling less than the S&amp;P 500's 0.6% drop, after it reported faster-than-expected sales growth for the most recent quarter and projected same-store sales growth this year. Over the past 12 months, it is up 31%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies are benefiting from continued strength in the labor market, where the unemployment rate has been lingering at its lowest since 2000. Data suggest that workers' wages are finally perking up, giving would-be buyers more money to spend on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, the housing market was the U.S. economy's biggest weakness. Now, it offers crucial support.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is a key segment of the economy, and it is aiding a continued acceleration in growth. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span>'s GDPNow real-time tracker for economic growth, which takes into account housing-starts data and other indicators, currently projects the U.S. economy will grow at an annualized pace of 3.2% in the first three months of this year. If that holds up, it would continue a streak of faster gross-domestic-product growth readings in recent quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts also say many housing-related companies will be beneficiaries from a drop in the corporate-tax rate to 21% from 35%, which was signed into law late last year. Such a benefit could offset any potential decline in housing demand due to new caps on the amount of property and state income taxes filers can deduct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. economy is strong and tax reform is net positive for the housing industry," said Carol Tome, Home Depot's chief financial officer, on a conference call with analysts Tuesday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week is likely to bring fresh evidence that demand for homes is growing, with the release of data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Wednesday. Sales of previously owned U.S. homes are expected to have climbed 1.3% in January to 5.64 million, according to a survey of economists, resuming an upward trend in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data also show a sanguine market. The number of new units under construction rose 9.7% to 1.326 million in January, Commerce Department data showed Friday. That was the third increase in four months, and it came despite cold weather, suggesting a shortage of housing supply is prompting builders to pick up the pace of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been on a plodding path higher for some time as it gradually recovered from the financial meltdown nearly a decade ago. But it has gained additional strength lately, despite broadly higher home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time there was a massive housing boom, it ended with a financial crisis as speculation led to a bubble that subsequently popped. But while home prices may be starting to get frothy in cities such as Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; and Denver, according to Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, there aren't yet echoes of the last economic cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the recent news is good for the housing market: A rise in mortgage rates, prompted by higher Treasury yields, could eventually cut into demand for new homes. The benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at about 4.5% this month, its highest since early 2014, according to weekly data from Bankrate.com. As recently as September, it was below 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the economy is stronger than it was the last time rates spiked in 2013, which means the housing market has more ability to withstand higher mortgage rates than it used to, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Higher mortgage rates may rob the housing market of some momentum but it won't derail the housing market altogether," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Peter Rudegeair and Christina Rexrode </div><div>1091 words</div><div>18 February 2018</div><div>07:00</div><div>WSJ Pro Venture Capital</div><div>RSTPROVC</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some well-funded startups have an unusual pitch for homeowners strapped for cash: Let's own this house together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of companies, including those backed by marquee Silicon Valley names such as <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> and Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, are experimenting with a product that essentially lets them take an ownership position in a house along with the homeowner. The agreements, called shared-equity contracts, provide a new way for investors to get exposure to rising home prices across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shared-equity products are aimed at new buyers who need help with a down payment, or current homeowners looking for an alternative to a cash-out mortgage refinancing or a home-equity loan. The first use has caught the attention of mortgage-finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which recently agreed to buy loans on properties where one firm, Unison Agreement Corp., contributes to the down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those cases, home buyers get money for part of their down payment in exchange for pledging some of the home's future price appreciation. The firms market them as a better alternative to low-down-payment loans, since they can give consumers more buying power without requiring them to take out pricey mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landed Inc. offers these down-payment contracts to teachers and other educators. Last year, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropy co-founded by Facebook Inc.'s chief executive, gave Landed $5 million to start a new fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Nizhnikov found out about Unison's shared-equity product from his mortgage lender, <span class="companylink">Guaranteed Rate Inc</span>. He used it for half of the 20% down payment on a home when he moved to accept a position in the psychology department at Southern Connecticut State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Nizhnikov, 46 years old, said the idea of sharing ownership of his home at first was a bit disconcerting. One thing that won him over: If his home's value falls, Unison shares in the loss. "We get to feel comfortable, just in case something crazy happens," Dr. Nizhnikov said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The length of the contracts can vary from a few years to 30. Homeowners can repay early, including if they sell their house before the term ends. How much they end up owing depends on how the value of their home changes. Because the funds are equity, not a borrowing, they don't require monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a Unison customer could receive $50,000 toward a $100,000 down payment on a $500,000 house. If the home later sells for $600,000, the customer gets back the $50,000 he or she initially put down plus 65% of the $100,000 appreciation. Unison gets back its $50,000 plus the other $35,000 of appreciated value. (That is keeping the mortgage constant at $400,000 for illustrative purposes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if the home goes down in value? Unison shares in the loss, but not all of it. Say the home sells for $400,000. After paying back the $400,000 mortgage, the homeowner's $50,000 in equity is wiped out. Unison only shares in 35% of the loss, preserving some of its equity. That means the homeowner is on the hook for the difference and needs to pay Unison $15,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shared-equity contracts can help home buyers unload some risk of a decline in property values, but they can also end up being expensive if housing prices rise. "The homeowners who are going to do this are the ones who don't have a lot of choices," said Allan Weiss, who founded a home-price analytics firm that bears his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patch Homes Inc., Point Digital Finance Inc. and Unison are among the companies that are marketing these products as an alternative to home-equity loans and cash-out refinancings. Unlike those products, shared-equity contracts don't add to the consumer's outstanding debt and tend to have looser qualification standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raju Mann of Marin County, Calif., took out about $85,000 through a shared-equity contract on her home from Point in 2016. She was encouraged by the startup's shareholders, which include <span class="companylink">Andreessen Horowitz</span> and former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mann, 54, said banks rejected her for loans because her sources of income—including royalties on the sale of books written by her grandfather, Nobel Prize-winning author Thomas Mann—were unpredictable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After getting funds from Point, Ms. Mann used the money to pay off debt. Home prices were rising in her neighborhood, though, and the longer she waited to pay back Point, the more the firm would make. She decided to exit her contract last month, using money she got refinancing her existing mortgage. Ultimately, she wound up paying Point around $120,000. "They made good money with me," Ms. Mann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for shared equity is embryonic. Unison said it has done 600 agreements in the past year; the other firms have done fewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the firms, the idea is to give homeowners the same option that companies have in raising funds via both debt and equity. The firms also typically charge fees for arranging the contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, yields can be attractive. Kingsbridge Wealth Management Inc., a Las Vegas multifamily office, has placed about $3 million into a fund that Point manages since May 2016, earning an internal rate of return of roughly 16%, said Kingsbridge President David J. Dunn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is also risk that investors' capital will be tied up for years before recognizing any gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-school biology teacher Sara Shayesteh and her husband, Isaac, used an agreement with Landed to cover about half their down payment for their home in San Mateo, Calif. That followed a discouraging search for homes where they kept getting bested by buyers with bigger down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shayestehs have 10 years to repay Landed, but can choose to do so after one year. They said it feels odd to have an investor own part of their house but are grateful for the arrangement. "We're trying to live in a crazy area with a market," said Ms. Shayesteh, 32. "There's no other way we could have purchased a property that would have met our needs."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week ahead will feature inflation data from Japan, a purchasing managers index reading from Europe and minutes from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>'s latest policy meeting, plus comments on the Fed's balance sheet from central-bank officials.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Housing construction got off to a strong start in 2018, which could help boost economic growth and ease home-price increases in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new housing units under construction rose 9.7% from a month earlier to an annual rate of 1.326 million [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf], the Commerce Department said Friday. That marked the third increase in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders also showed signs they are planning to ramp up construction later this year. The number of permits they lined up to build units rose 7.4% last month to an annual pace of 1.396 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, economists said the numbers suggest that 2018 will continue a trend of gradual improvement in new-home construction that will remain well below normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a generational issue because we've fallen so far behind in supply that we're still playing catch up," said Robert Frick, corporate economist with <span class="companylink">Navy Federal Credit Union</span>. "We've still got years to go before we see these numbers improve to normal levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts numbers are volatile and can be subject to big revisions. The margin of error for the January rise of 9.7% was plus or minus 16.8 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the report was encouraging because starts rose despite frigid January weather across many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More disappointing was that last month's gains were overwhelmingly driven by an increase in multifamily starts, which tend to be especially volatile and are unlikely to remain at such high levels, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment starts surged 24% in January, while construction of single-family homes rose just 3.7%. Permits for buildings with five units or more likewise were up more than 25%, while permits for single-family homes fell 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the longer-term, new-home construction is picking up. Total starts rose 7.3% in the 12 months through January, while single-family starts rose 7.6% during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's numbers offer the first glimpse into the impact of a tax overhaul bill passed in late December that reduced incentives for homeownership that are especially important in higher cost markets. The bill also cut individual tax rates and slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, along with other changes benefiting small businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree, said the tax code changes could boost builder margins by 10% to 15%, which could in turn encourage them to build more homes at the low end, where profit margins are thinnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home builders are able to be a little more aggressive in terms of getting out there and building homes," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>957 words</div><div>14 February 2018</div><div>06:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bronx is the new Brooklyn. Sort of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following in the footsteps of Queens, Hoboken and Jersey City, the Bronx—especially the gritty, once scorched South Bronx—is attracting new interest from renters and buyers priced out of Brooklyn and other trendy areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence: Data showing that home prices in New York City's northernmost borough have eclipsed the previous record high set in 2006, fueled by a surge in prices in the South Bronx, according to the <span class="companylink">Real Estate Board of New York</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark, already reached by the other boroughs, shows the relentless demand for housing in neighborhoods with easy public transportation to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is it all about transportation and value compared with Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan," said Charles Brophy, a <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> real-estate broker, who has watched the ups and downs of the housing market in Kingsbridge Heights in the northwest Bronx for more than four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a house in Kingsbridge Heights and nearby neighborhoods rose 15% in the fourth quarter to $470,000 compared with $407,000 in the same quarter the year before, according to the Real Estate Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That included a Tudor house near Van Cortlandt Park that Mr. Brophy sold for $565,000 in December. The buyer, he said, was from the Midwest by way of Brooklyn, and was attracted to the diversity and transportation in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Bronx, the average sale price for one-to-three-family houses was $515,000, up 2% from a peak set in the fourth quarter of 2006. The median price of $499,000 was 1% below the peak set in the second quarter of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John H. Banks, the president of the Real Estate Board, said he remembers vividly the 1970s, when the Bronx was known for widespread arson fires and other crimes. Since then, he said, the Bronx, like the rest of the city, had undergone a significant transformation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Bronx is coming to that transformation a little bit later, but it is happening nonetheless," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough has a way to go, even after large public investments in affordable-housing developments over many years. It has the highest poverty and unemployment rates and lowest median-household income of any borough, according to 2016 data from New York University's Furman Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crime in the Bronx has fallen sharply, though somewhat less than in other boroughs, with major crimes in the Bronx, down 75% since 1990, and robbery down 80%, according to police data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the population, which fell more than 20% during the 1970s, has been edging up since 1980, including a gain of more than 70,000 people since 2010, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reinvention of the Bronx is most evident in Mott Haven in the South Bronx, where a small supply of homes on the market caused a jump in real-estate prices toward the end of 2017. Luke Selimaj, a broker at Weichert Properties, said prices have been rising steadily in parts of the South Bronx below East 149th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, Mr. Selimaj put a modest two-family brick house on East 144th Street in Mott Haven on the market for $669,000. It was built in the 1990s as part of an affordable-housing program. After a bidding war among several buyers, the property sold in December for $705,000, according to real-estate website StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after, Mr. Selimaj listed a similar house with a larger yard, at 425 East 144th St., for $925,000, a price above what anything similar has ever sold for. It too went into contract quickly, for more than $850,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I took advantage of the low inventory," Mr. Selimaj said. "Either you want it or you don't. You have no other option."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers, he said, are moving from Long Island, and wanted a location an easy drive to visit family in New Jersey and in Westchester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, developers are focusing on the southern edge of Mott Haven, within about a half-hour subway ride to Midtown Manhattan. They are reclaiming old red-brick industrial buildings, former ice plants and piano factories, and bringing in restaurants and bars to add buzz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mott Haven reminds us of SoHo 30 years ago and, similarly, Dumbo 15 years ago," said Robin Schneiderman, a managing director of Halstead Property Development Marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a market analysis, Mr. Schneiderman predicted a "rapid gentrification," with at least 10 multifamily projects in Mott Haven under development, attracting more than 2,000 rentals and condominiums, along with 400 hotel rooms nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, Mr. Schneiderman said, would be to set rents and sale prices close to but below those available in more hip neighborhoods such as Long Island City, Downtown Brooklyn or Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new six-story luxury rental building with 130 apartments at 25 Bruckner Blvd. has just begun leasing, with a one-bedroom unit listed at $2,200 a month after concessions. The development includes a glassed in pool, a sauna and a "piano room" to celebrate the neighborhood's history in piano manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest project planned is a six-tower development with about 1,280 apartments, planned by Somerset Partners and the Chetrit Group along the Harlem River in Mott Haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks away, a Bronx-based developer, Joshua Weissman, is constructing a 91-unit rental building with views of Manhattan and the Harlem River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact is, the Bronx is safe and the Bronx has a cool story," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing prices recover from the Great Recession, municipalities across America are considering laws that will raise the cost of homeownership. The Wall Street Journal reports that cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Atlanta are requiring developers to set aside some portion of their new units to sell or rent at below-market prices to low-income households. Like many progressive promises, this is a fool's errand. These laws will reduce the cost of housing for targeted political groups if they increase the cost of housing for everyone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept, called "inclusionary zoning," has been implemented by 886 communities, nearly 90% of which are in California, Massachusetts and New Jersey. While the intent of these laws is to increase the supply of affordable housing, history shows they increase the cost of housing and limit the supply of new affordable units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider a project plan to produce 100 identical new housing units with development outlays for land, materials, zoning site preparation and other costs of $23.75 million. Including a 5% return for the developer, the project costs $25 million. Without government involvement, the market price for each housing unit will be $250,000. The successful sale of 100 units at this price would cover all out-of-pocket development costs and earn the developer a competitive profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens if the municipality requires the developer to sell 10% of these new units at below-market prices? Laws are rarely so specific, but assume that the municipality caps the price on affordable units at $125,000. The law doesn't change the cost of building. It merely changes the price the developer can legally charge for some of its new housing units. The total cost of $25 million must now be spread over 10 units, each with a maximum legal price of $125,000, and 90 units priced to cover the remaining cost. Each of the 90 "market price" units must sell for $263,889 for the developer to cover costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers may view inclusionary zoning as a free lunch, but requiring developers to sell or rent 10% of their housing units at below-market prices to "qualified households" means charging above-market prices to everyone else. The affordable-housing requirement increases the median house price in the development by 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact on nonsubsidized home prices can be even more counterproductive. Inclusionary zoning laws impose significant costs on developers, which are forced to find buyers with the necessary qualifications and financing to purchase the subsidized units. If the potential pool of nonsubsidized qualified home buyers falls short of 90 households when new units are priced at $263,889, the developer won't undertake the project. In that case the overall supply of houses will be smaller as new developments are abandoned, putting additional pressure on the prices of existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The example is simplistic, but the historical record bears out its common-sense predictions. A 2004 study by <span class="companylink">the Reason Foundation</span> found that inclusionary zoning laws led to less affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay area. The total production of new housing units declined, and the production of new affordable-housing units declined precipitously. The drop in new home construction also coincided with significant price increases for resales and new "market price" units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies by both the <span class="companylink">Cato Institute</span> and the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span> show that housing is more affordable where there are fewer land-use restrictions. If zoning, building codes, fees and inclusionary zoning laws raise development costs, housing will be expensive. Many zoning codes place restrictions on unit density, parking capacity, the size of dwelling units, landscaping and countless other factors that drive up building costs and price many households out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than promise the impossible -- making housing affordable by decree -- municipal governments should embrace practical solutions. They should adopt land-use and building code regulations that reduce development costs. They should expedite approval processes, lower impact fees and taxes, and reduce other unnecessary regulations. Only by adopting measures that trim development costs can municipal governments stimulate the production of new housing that is more affordable for everyone.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Bill Malcolm listed his childhood home in August in Sunnyvale, Calif., for $1.688 million, he thought he was asking a lot. After all, the ordinary, one-story house was less than 2,000 square feet, hadn't been structurally renovated since his parents bought it for $27,500 in 1963, and was on only a third of an acre. But he figured its location close to the headquarters of Apple and <span class="companylink">Google</span> would command a premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did: a premium of about $782,000 above his asking price, selling for $2.47 million a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was unbelievable," says Dave Clark, Mr. Malcolm's real-estate agent. Even in the notoriously overpriced Silicon Valley, where he regularly gets 10 or more offers for a listing, this one was different. It drew 21 offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is no secret the housing market is on fire. Last year, almost a quarter of all U.S. home sales were above asking price, according to real-estate listings website Zillow. But the average premium over asking for those homes was $7,000—not $700,000. Even in the hottest real-estate markets, where there is a severe shortage of inventory[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-growth-gained-momentum-in-september-1511877892], the highest bid typically isn't more than a couple hundred thousand dollars over asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What often distinguishes the houses that go way above asking—half a million or more—is a feature that the other homes in the neighborhood just don't have, says Toby Lumpkin, a real-estate broker with Realogics Sotheby's International Realty in Seattle. That can be a better view, more southern exposure, an especially tasteful renovation, a three-car garage in a parking-challenged city, or a side yard, which is what set apart Mr. Malcolm's house. It's also often a price low enough to attract attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kerry Bucklin saw a house for sale on Mercer Island, Wash., on the waterfront, he thought its price of $1.995 million was too low. The Midcentury Modern home[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/popular-midcentury-modern-homes-are-fetching-top-dollar-1516288450], built in 1959, needed updating and shared 210 feet of waterfront with five other houses. But it was the closest of the houses to the shore, offered unobstructed views in a parklike setting and allowed him to go paddling on Lake Washington without having to load a canoe on his car. At the same time, the property was close to the freeway, shaving 6 miles off his commute to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bucklin, 55, a real-estate lawyer, had been looking for a couple of years to replace the large family home mid-island, where he lived alone since becoming an empty-nester. He bought the home in June by paying just over $500,000 above asking, beating seven other offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C., a house in Georgetown listed at $4.9 million sold for $5.6 million after only a few days on the market—$700,000 over its asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is because it had a bevy of desirable features, says Christie-Anne Weiss, a Realtor with Ritzert Weiss Partners in Washington, D.C. It was on a quiet street, close to lots of stores and restaurants, was already renovated, came with three parking spaces, had lots of bedrooms plus a heated pool, and it was semidetached—with the long side of the house facing south, allowing light on three sides, a rare find in Georgetown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's so much pent-up demand," says Ms. Weiss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowhere is demand more pent up than in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the past four months, 39 homes in Silicon Valley have sold for $500,000 or more over the listing price, says Mark Wong, a real-estate broker with <span class="companylink">Alain Pinel Realtors</span>, based in Saratoga, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That figure includes a "lovingly cared for and well maintained home" (read: not updated). The 53-year-old, three-bedroom, one-story house on 0.197 acre in West San Jose got 15 offers and sold to an all-cash buyer for $2.5 million—$815,000 over asking. A three-bedroom, 2,040-square-foot house in the Glen Park neighborhood sold in October for $2.6 million—nearly $1 million over its listing price of $1.675 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Seattle is another hot spot[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-silicon-seattle-high-home-prices-1461163535]. Over the past year, the city has seen the greatest increase in the country in the share of sales above the asking price, surging to 52% of home sales in 2017 from 20% of sales in 2012, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One example: a three-bedroom, 3,980-square-foot house in Medina that Charles Simonyi, who recently sold <span class="companylink">Intentional Software</span> to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, bought for $3.5 million—$500,000 over the list price, according to public records. (Mr. Simonyi and his wife, Lisa, declined to comment).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the suburb of Bellevue, Arman Manoucheri had been looking for a house for three years, but nothing seemed right. Then, one day, he saw it: an updated blue painted Tudor with views that reminded him of Bellagio in Italy, and lots of privacy so he could play his drums at night without bothering anyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My heart dropped. I realized you cannot put a price on this because it couldn't be duplicated," says the attorney. He got the house for just over $500,000 above the $2.125 million listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many bidding wars in the Seattle area are won by people paying all cash. More also are removing contingencies such as inspections and financing[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-strangely-effective-and-easy-way-to-win-a-bidding-war-1516280661], and putting down nonrefundable deposits of $100,000 or more, says Daniel Marinello, director-broker with <span class="companylink">Windermere Real Estate</span> on Mercer Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Moghaddas of Avenue Properties, says more clients request so-called escalation clauses in their bids: an agreement to beat the highest offer by a certain amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars are less common in cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and Boston. New York has seen only a handful of sales of $500,000 and more over the asking price in the past year. One, Greta Garbo's longtime apartment, sold in December for $2.55 million above [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/greta-garbos-longtime-new-york-home-sells-for-8-5-million-1514304447]the $5.95 million list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a premium is about marketing. Helen Hitchcock put her 7,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom home on Mercer Island on the market for $6.5 million in March. A real-estate broker, she knew not to include the 8,600-square-foot lot with a view that she also owned behind her house, and which could have been bought by a developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two days, a potential buyer came by and Ms. Hitchcock offered him the extra lot for an additional $1 million. He bought the package for $7.5 million 15 minutes later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I knew anyone who could afford our house would want the back lot, too," she says.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>582 words</div><div>30 January 2018</div><div>10:16</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued their sharp upward trajectory in November, a trend that is likely to continue this year due to continued shortages of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which covers the entire nation, rose 6.2% in the 12 months ended in November, up slightly from a 6.1% year-over-year increase reported in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 6.1% over the year, up from 5.9% in October. The 20-city index gained 6.4%, up from 6.3% the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected the 20-city index to rise 6.3% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the primary culprit in the continued sharp price increases is a lack of new supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given slow population and income growth since the financial crisis, demand is not the primary factor in rising home prices," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "Without more supply, home prices may continue to substantially outpace inflation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer said that housing starts in recent years have been even weaker during the recovery than they were during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. From 2010 to the latest month of data, single-family starts have averaged 632,000 annually, less than the average of 698,000 in the financial crisis and far less than the long-term average of 1 million starts annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets that are seeing the steepest increases remain concentrated on the West Coast. Seattle reported the largest annual gain, at 12.7%, followed by Las Vegas at 10.6%. San Francisco, which had seen price increases slow over the last couple of months, reported the third-strongest gain, at 9.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's hard to find a place to call home anymore," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at financial firm MUFG. He said that home values "continue to move out of reach for home buyers in many markets which will lead to instability in the economy at some point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. index rose 0.2% in November before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.3% and the 20-city index rose 0.2% from October to November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.7% month-over-month, the 10-city index saw a 0.8% increase and the 20-city index rose 0.7%. All 20 cities saw price increases after seasonal adjustment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in 2017 reached their highest level since 2006, according to data released by the National Association of Realtors last week. Adjusting for population sales remain sluggish, however, a trend economists say is also due to the lack of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More supply will be critical to the continued health of the housing market going forward, as demand from home buyers is very unlikely to fade over the next year and beyond," Zillow Senior Economist Aaron Terrazas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's numbers don't reflect the impact of changes to the tax code [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-tax-law-just-one-month-old-is-roaring-through-u-s-companies-1516899466] passed late last year. Limits on deductions for state and local taxes and the mortgage interest deduction could dampen demand for housing and stymie home-price increases in a number of the pricier markets tracked by Case-Shiller, including the New York City area, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—New home sales in the U.S. lost steam in December but wrapped up a solid year in a segment of the housing market that has faced tight inventory and fast-rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family homes—a relatively narrow slice of all U.S. home sales— decreased 9.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] in December, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a sharper fall than economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say a post-hurricane bounceback in sales drove strong activity through the fall, and some of the December pullback could mark a reversal from those gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 8.3% in 2017 from the prior year to 608,000, the highest level since 2007. This offers positive momentum for the market heading into 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do expect new home sales to pick up over the next year," said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. "Home builders do sense that there is demand out there, particularly at more affordable price points, and are doing what they can to try to meet that demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in November jumped to a postrecession high, clocking in at a 689,000 unit rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite solid growth in sales in 2017, sales still remain well below the elevated levels seen before the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales dropped in all regions in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wider housing market, inventory has been tight recently—in part because of lackluster home construction—and that has contributed to a run-up in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home sold in December was $335,400. At the current sales pace, there was a 5.7-month supply of new homes on the market at the end of December. Though the December figure was up from 4.9 in November, supply remains tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective Charlotte home buyer Krishan Intwala, 32 years old, recently shifted focus from looking at updated resale homes to looking at new homes, recognizing the higher price of new homes makes it tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As much as we like [new homes], it's hard to swallow getting a smaller house, a smaller yard, a smaller lot of land," Mr. Intwala said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales data can be volatile from month to month. December's decrease comes with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 11 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which represent the bulk of the U.S. market, fell in December but rose in 2017 as a whole [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-fell-in-december-1516806728] to their highest level since 2006, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes slowed in December, but 2017 was still the best year for the hot housing market since the mid-2000s boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 3.6% in December from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2017 as a whole, though, sales increased 1.1% to 5.51 million, the best year for sales since 2006's 6.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales grew in November to the strongest pace in more than a decade, buoyed in part by solid economic growth. Economists said part of the sales gain could reflect catch-up after sale closings were knocked off course by late-summer hurricanes. December could have marked a reversal of some of that bounceback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The promising news is that existing home sales are up over the last year despite chronically low inventory," said Cheryl Young, senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "There is a lot of pent-up demand [and] still a significant amount of people looking to buy homes despite really low inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, the stock of homes on the market would be gone in 3.2 months, which the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> says is the lowest inventory since it began tracking these data in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edie Butler, a North Carolina-based Realtor with Keller Williams, said the supply of homes available for sale in the Charlotte market started decreasing after peaking in October 2010 at more than 50,000. This month, there were 29,800 homes for sale, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this time last year, we were in a seller's market," Ms. Butler said. "This year. . .we're in an even tighter seller's market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are converging to buttress home buying. The national unemployment rate in December was 4.1%, holding at a 17-year low. Gauges of household confidence remain elevated. Borrowing costs remain low by historical standards; the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in December was 3.95%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the limited inventory on the market is driving up home prices at a rapid pace, potentially blocking some would-be buyers. The median sale price for an existing home in December was $246,800, up 5.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in the tax law passed in December limited deductibility of the most expensive mortgages and made it pricier to live in states with high property taxes. Some of the monthly sales pullback could be attributed to hesitancy on the part of potential home buyers in more expensive states, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s Ms. Young said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes account for the bulk of homebuying activity in the U.S.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of housing units that began construction fell sharply at the end of 2017, but still capped a solid year of new single-family home construction that could soon relieve rising home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 8.2% in December [http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.19 million, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Residential permits, which can signal how much construction is queued up, also fell, dropping 0.1% to an annual pace of 1.30 million last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's housing starts decline came after two strong months of growth that stemmed from rebuilding efforts occurring in the wake of hurricanes that ravaged the southern and eastern U.S. Such large back-to-back growth usually isn't sustainable and appears to have corrected back to a normal level in December. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a decline, but a smaller drop at 1.5% for housing starts and a larger 0.8% decline for permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December also saw inclement winter weather in the South and East that likely significantly impacted home construction. The South saw housing starts drop 14.2% and the Northeast dropped 4.3% to the lowest level since May 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Starts were always likely to correct after overshooting… But the severe weather in late December likely did extra damage, and the first half of January likely will be depressed too," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-starts data can be volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Looking past monthly volatility, starts were up 2.4% in 2017 when compared to 2016, and permits increased 4.7% in the same period, signaling solid construction in 2017 that coincided with rising demand that has pushed up prices amid a chronic homes shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for existing homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-jumped-in-november-1513782145?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=20] hit $248,000 in November, up 5.8% from a year earlier, which is a more rapid rise than both inflation and wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But construction of new single-family homes appears to be ramping up at a solid pace. Permits and starts both increased by about 9% in 2017 from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should more construction come about, the much needed additional inventory will help calm home price appreciation. That would be a good trend for housing affordability," National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a press release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New residential construction hit a postrecession high in October 2016 but has trended lower since as multifamily construction has declined. It remains far below the levels reached during the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor shortages, rising land costs and increasingly restrictive land-use regulations have helped create a shortage of inventory that is driving up home prices much more quickly than wages and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home builders are feeling upbeat about the housing market. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' Housing Market Index, which gauges home builder sentiment about the market for single-family homes, fell in January, but remained near an 18-year high.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>833 words</div><div>10 January 2018</div><div>11:37</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any central banker watching the stock market today should get a queasy sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing boom preceded the last recession. A tech stock bubble ushered in its forerunner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, stock [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/tech-boom-creates-new-order-for-world-markets-1511260200] and property prices are once again setting records [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-stocks-extend-gains-1515034296], in absolute terms and relative to household incomes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-report-says-stocks-homes-values-helped-total-household-net-worth-rise-1512667073]. That may leave the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell, nominated to succeed [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/choosing-powell-as-fed-chairman-is-a-safe-gamble-1509653197] Janet Yellen as Fed chair next month, confronting some agonizing trade-offs in the next year or two: What if low inflation calls for low interest rates but those low interest rates make an eventual, destructive asset bust more likely? Should he lean against an incipient bubble by raising rates faster now, or plan to mop up the mess if assets collapse later?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the past isn't much help as a guide to the present. The 2008 cataclysm resulted not just from falling housing prices, but the knock-on wave of mortgage defaults that then brought down the institutions that held the debt. Today, the financial system has much thicker buffers [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-stress-tests-clear-31-of-33-big-u-s-banks-for-capital-returns-1467232237] against loan losses and is more closely regulated. Credit growth isn't excessive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock price-to-earnings ratios are by some measures the highest since 1999 [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-earnings-record-offers-hope-that-rally-will-continue-1512455401], but today's are more justifiable. In 1999, government bonds yielded 6%; today, they yield 2.6%, which makes them a less appealing alternative to stocks. Moreover, even if stocks fell, that wouldn't necessarily destabilize the financial system [https://blogs-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2017/11/29/yellen-to-congress-dont-fear-the-stock-rally/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there's nothing flashing red there, or possibly even orange," Ms. Yellen said in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it doesn't take a crisis for an asset bust to hurt. The 1990s tech stock run-up fueled a surge in investment and spending via higher wealth and easier financing conditions. When the bubble burst in 2001, that surge reversed, dragging the economy down. The damage was contained because the Fed quickly slashed interest rates by nearly 5 percentage points. Today, it can at most cut them by 1.5 points [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-sees-continued-path-of-increases-in-2018-1513191780].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market's 23% rise since the end of 2016 has been a powerful economic tailwind. Increased wealth has encouraged consumers to spend more and save less of their paychecks, driving the personal saving rate below 3%, the lowest since 2007 [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/consumers-cant-be-economys-saving-grace-in-2018-1513962555]. Both spending and stocks have gotten an added kick from the recent tax cut [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/gop-tax-bill-fixes-some-problems-but-exacerbates-others-1513787259].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't a stretch to see all those factors switching into reverse within a year or two. And if dangerous excesses are simmering in the financial system, they may not appear until the boom goes bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the old days, recessions occurred because an overheating economy led to higher inflation, then higher interest rates and a pullback in spending. In such a world, getting interest rates correct could achieve both low, stable inflation and sustainably low unemployment, which economists dubbed the "divine coincidence."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as Mr. Powell noted a year ago, no divine coincidence dictates that the ​same interest rate will achieve both 2% inflation and a stable financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether that means the Fed should stop bubbles from forming in the first place has long vexed officials. Before the global financial crisis, they concluded no: pre-emptively pricking bubbles seemed much riskier than letting them burst of their own accord. They are less dogmatic now. Though officials' first choice is to use regulatory authority to ensure any such bust doesn't sink any financial institutions, Ms. Yellen said in 2010 she couldn't "unequivocally rule out" using higher interest rates to pre-empt a bubble. But she set the bar quite high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In actions, if not words, Fed monetary policy already does respond to financial stability concerns and asset prices. In a 2016 study, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren and two co-authors counted how often words such as "bubble," "bust," "crisis" and "volatility" appeared in transcripts of monetary policy discussions at Fed meetings. They found that such worries tended to move interest rates more [https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2016/does-fed-policy-reveal-a-ternary-mandate.aspx] than mere considerations of inflation and unemployment could justify, although the influence was stronger when rates were falling than rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Powell largely agrees with his predecessors that monetary policy should be a last resort for dealing with financial excess. Yet his bar doesn't appear to be as high. When Mr. Powell joined the Fed in 2012, he told colleagues he worried that the Fed's bond-buying program could fuel risk-taking down the road, according to meeting transcripts released last week [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/powell-backed-feds-bond-buying-plan-with-reservations-in-2012-1515171836].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2015 speech, he said: "Tighter monetary policy might eventually be necessary" if dangerous risk-taking reappeared. A year ago, he went further: "The current extended period of very low nominal rates calls for a high degree of vigilance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case for vigilance has only grown since.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA—The gentrification of the Fishtown neighborhood here looks like something city planners dream of, with developers renovating old row houses as young professionals, along with new restaurants and businesses, pile in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home prices have shot up so quickly in recent years that the latest wave of young professionals say they are having a hard time making the finances work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now several Philadelphia City Council members want to pass a law requiring property developers to set aside 10% of new projects as below-market units, to improve overall affordability in a city that once was among America's biggest bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring housing costs aren't confined to New York or San Francisco. Cities including Pittsburgh, Detroit, Buffalo and Nashville all have explored or adopted policies that, like Philadelphia's, seek to create more cheap housing by an approach known as inclusionary zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers say the approach can backfire by making projects too expensive to build, even with tax abatements or other compensation for the added costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really underscores the housing-affordability problem is much more widespread than simply a problem in the 10 most expensive coastal cities[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/can-lofts-and-cool-workspaces-lure-people-back-downtown-even-in-fort-wayne-1514894400]," said Stockton Williams, executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the <span class="companylink">Urban Land Institute</span> in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit in 2017 passed a law requiring developers that receive city subsidies or discounted land to set aside 20% of units for lower-income households, typically those making between about $34,000 and $41,000 for a family of four. Officials say it is an effort to get ahead of affordability woes as parts of the city revitalize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Atlanta passed a requirement that developers set aside a share of units for low-income families in new projects in certain rapidly gentrifying parts of the city. Pittsburgh may also consider an ordinance this year that could force developers to include affordable housing in new projects, in return for a tax benefit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back, officials in cities like Washington and Boston have remarked that if they had done more early on to preserve affordable housing, "they might not have as acute of a problem as they have today," said Arthur Jemison, Detroit's director of housing and revitalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Philadelphia, the downtown Center City area has experienced a residential building boom, much of it higher-end properties. In neighborhoods to the north and south, an influx of professionals has pushed up values in historically working-class neighborhoods. Once-gritty Fishtown now brims with art galleries and pubs serving craft beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2014, the median home value in Fishtown has jumped more than 50% to around $250,000, according to home-search website Zillow. Parts of nearby Kensington have experienced similar increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet census figures show that about 400,000 of the city's 1.6 million residents live under the poverty line, the highest rate among the 10 most populous U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Wilcox had identified Philadelphia as the city where she would launch her new career as a speech-language pathologist. The relatively cheap housing was a big draw—especially compared with her native Boston as well as Seattle, where she spent her 30s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when she arrived in July, graduate degree in hand, Ms. Wilcox found she no longer could afford to buy in Fishtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was kind of remarkable how much prices had gone up in that short period of time," said Ms. Wilcox, 41 years old. "It's crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Wilcox, who lives by herself, wouldn't benefit from the proposed new law. With a salary of nearly $60,000, she earns too much. Yet a house in her preferred part of Fishtown seems out of reach for $220,000, the maximum she feels she could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, she pays $950 to rent a small house in a "shady" part of Kensington. Her plan is to save and resume her search in a year, despite worries the market will be even further out of reach. "I'm afraid to think what a year from now it will look like," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While swaths of Philadelphia are considered affordable, much of the city's housing stock is in bad shape and located in areas lacking jobs, public transit and amenities such as parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't necessarily have an affordable-housing crisis, we have a quality affordable-housing crisis," said Andrew Goodman, community engagement director at the nonprofit New Kensington Community Development Corp., which backs the inclusionary zoning bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measure would require developers to reserve 10% of new rental or for-sale units at below-market price levels, or pay into a city housing fund whose mission includes fixing homes. In return, developers could build more overall units than zoning limits would permit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify for a below-market unit under the bill, a household could earn no more than 50% to 80% of the area's median income, or roughly $41,500 to $66,500 a year for a family of four. The lower range would apply to rentals, the higher range to for-sale units. Monthly housing costs for a family of four would be capped at $1,040 to $1,663, based on income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration of Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, supports the goals but says the bill would set rents too low to cover construction and other developer costs. The council could vote on the bill later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leo Addimando, managing partner at the Alterra Property Group and vice president of the city's Building Industry Association, said he supports mixed-income housing but thinks the council's proposal would worsen the imbalance between the city's high construction costs and comparatively low rents, yielding fewer new housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will certainly slow down residential development," said Mr. Addimando.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>697 words</div><div>28 December 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A8B</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures 2017 was a banner year for Manhattan residential real estate, with median prices setting a record, and sales volume rising above 2016 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the year ended not with a bang, but worries over the future of the market. While median apartment prices are up from 2016 to 2017, they began falling toward the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median Manhattan apartment price of $1.08 million in the fourth quarter was up 4.6% compared with the same quarter in 2016. But it fell 9.8% compared with the record it hit in the second quarter of 2017, according to an analysis of city property records by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and analysts attributed the slide to an oversupply of expensive apartments in Manhattan, and uncertainty over a major overhaul of the tax code that was signed by President Donald J. Trump last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some analysts said that as buyers understand the implications of tax changes more clearly, the Manhattan market could pick up some momentum next year. Of course, all bets are off if there is upheaval in the economy or the financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, a major New York-based brokerage, said that many buyers are convinced that prices peaked in 2017 and have fallen since and may continue to be under pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We lost a lot of deals in the fourth quarter, while people waited to see the outcome of the tax bill, she said. "Now that the uncertainty is gone they will be able to make a decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said buyers were active but "focused on value and reasonable pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The good news is there are a lot of buyers who are ready to purchase next year," Ms. Liebman said. "Sellers who don't overshoot the mark should do well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2017, records were set for median prices for both co-ops and condominiums, with the overall median price of a Manhattan apartment setting a record of $1,150,000, up 6.5% from 2016. Median apartment prices have risen every year since 2011, on an annual basis, according analysis by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Manhattan condo was $1.7 million in 2017, up 2.7% compared with 2016, while the median price of a co-op was $800,000, up 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only price decline in 2017 was with new developments. Their median price of $2.6 million was down 0.6% compared with the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing market toward the end of this year also showed up in contract signings at the ultraluxury end of the market. The pace of contract signings for the most expensive apartments priced at $10 million or more slipped during October and November, according to real-estate data and listing site UrbanDigs.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noah Rosenblatt, a broker and founder of UrbanDigs said that deal volume for lower-priced segments of the market, especially apartments listed for under $2 million, remained strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think this tax overhaul is going to kill the real-estate market," Mr. Rosenblatt said. "We already came down at the higher-end price point. A lot of things are priced in and baked in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another broker, Donna Olshan, who produces a weekly report on contract signings above $4 million, said that there were worrying signs in the luxury market, including an increase in the average time a listing spent on the market of nearly four months, from about 10 months in 2016 to 14 months this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top sales of 2017 included the sale of three penthouses on the 92nd and 93rd floor at 432 Park Ave., the glass and concrete skyscraper on East 56th Street and Park Avenue, for a total price of $91.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-most expensive deal of the year was the $80 million sale of an Upper East Side mansion at 12 E. 86th St. Brokers say that sale is due to close before the end of the year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kansas City, Mo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Chinese calendar, this is the Year of the Rooster. But in the annals of U.S. museums, 2017 could go down as the Year of the Han. A dynasty that ruled over a unified China almost uninterruptedly from 206 B.C. to A.D. 220, the Han Empire has been the subject of three major shows. Each has featured terra-cotta figures of musicians, dancers and soldiers, mouthwatering ornaments and beautifully carved jade. But each has combined these with other works to illustrate a particular aspect of the Han, a dynasty whose name has become synonymous with ethnic Chinese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first show, which opened in February at the San Francisco Asian Art Museum, focused primarily on the daily life of royals, from private chambers to banquet halls. The second, at the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span>, which closed in July, emphasized the building of a unified state and shared identity. A third exhibition now highlights the medium of jade and the cultural impact of the Chu, a long-lived kingdom that became a vassal state of the Han.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Dreams of the Kings: A Jade Suit for Eternity" originated at New York's China Institute Gallery, whose director, Willow Weilan Hai, collaborated with a team from the Xuzhou Museum, which lent the 70-plus works. After a May to November run in New York, it has opened in its second and last venue, <span class="companylink">The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art</span>, where its installation and proximity to the museum's renowned collection of Chinese art endow this gem of a show with added depth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Dreams of the Kings: A Jade Suit for Eternity'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art</span>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through April 1, 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, for example, we never lose sight of the fact that all the works were found in tombs. The show starts in a large gallery, where displays on the right speak of the Chu's power and military might, while those to the left present evidence of the elegant lifestyle and rich artistic culture they underpinned. One side showcases figurines of armed soldiers and kneeling charioteers, a suit of armor, and royal seals in bronze, silver and gold. The other side offers figurines of court attendants; elegant and everyday bronze wares; a collared leopard sculpted in marble; and a cluster of terra-cotta musicians and dancers that illustrate two of the Chu's principal artistic contributions to Han culture (a short video supplies motion and sound).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is jade, a stone harder than steel yet variously ground, etched and pierced. It permeates the show. Here a delicately carved dragon-shaped pendant, there a sculptural sword ornament. Here an ethereal ritual disc, there two drinking vessels made from scooped-out chunks of the stone. According to Colin Mackenzie, the Nelson-Atkins's senior curator of Chinese art and author of the catalog's essay on jade, nobody yet knows exactly why this medium reached such heights under the Han. Certainly the wealth of patrons helped, but it isn't clear what role, say, the use of iron or some new, as yet unidentified technique played.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is certain is its centrality in death rituals. Anywhere you stand in the gallery, you see the show's prized work: the burial suit of a second-century B.C. Chu king made of 4,248 pieces of jade joined with knots of gold wire. It is the oldest such burial suit found to date, and it lies as though in state in the small adjoining Temple Room, surrounded by yet more jade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By ensconcing the show within the galleries of the permanent collection, the Nelson-Atkins broadens its story. Two lacquer cups and a piece of embroidery from 206 B.C. to A.D. 9, for example, add two missing mediums. A Han dynasty tomb brick with the relief of a stag's head reminds us that regional styles co-existed. And a wood figure from the fourth-century B.C. bears similarities to the show's clay figurines. Then, once again, there is jade, which appears throughout the permanent collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jade had been prized since Neolithic times, and, for more than 500 years, the elite had covered the faces of their dead with masks of jade, an example of which is in the show. But during the Han dynasty they also fully encased corpses in "boxes" or "cages" made of small jade tiles. One theory is that this burial suit evolved from the face masks and/or military armor, expressing the belief that jade could safeguard the body indefinitely from the malevolent forces that cause its decay. While it isn't clear when the practice began, it proved short-lived. One of several rulers vying to succeed the Han, Emperor Wen of Wei (reigned 220-226) prohibited lavish burial practices, decrying them as "foolish" and harmful. "Every Han imperial tomb has been unearthed," he argued, their treasures stolen and the bodies themselves destroyed. "What suffering they must endure," he lamented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He might be heartened to see people almost two millennia later conserving and studying what robbers left behind.</p>
