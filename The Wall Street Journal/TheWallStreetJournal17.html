<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—China's housing market continued to show a modest slowdown in February as new data show that price growth was capped by discounts in some cities while the Lunar New Year holiday had an impact on sales overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average new-home prices issued by data provider China Real Estate Index System on Friday showed prices grew 10.79% in February from a year earlier, compared with January's 11.1%, which also slowed from December's 11.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey tracks new-home sales in 100 Chinese cities. The average price in February rose 0.54% compared with January, the survey said. That is down from 0.63% in January over December, which was the slowest on-month gain in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More customers are staying on the sidelines since some property developers started to introduce price cuts from mid-February, sales agents said. In Hangzhou in east China, at least two property developers introduced discounts on their new homes last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While January and February are typically slower periods for home sales, some observers have warned that housing prices in China may cool in 2014 because many developers are concerned about clearing inventory in places where there is an oversupply of homes, especially in tier two and tier three cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the survey, more cities showed a pickup, however, as 64 cities registered higher month-on-month prices compared with 62 in January. Prices in the remaining cities fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers are trying to avoid the risk of a sharper correction down the line and have implemented cooling measures to restrain home prices. Home prices in some cities are starting to moderate amid slower economic growth and expectations of weaker gains in housing sales this year compared with 2013's sharp upturn. A large chunk of demand from genuine home buyers was already digested last year, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese government launched a property-tightening campaign in 2010 to rein in frothy housing prices, but its results have been limited so far. China raised mortgage and down-payment rates for second-home buyers and imposed curbs on multiple home purchases, but they have been arbitrarily enforced by local governments, according to sales agents and analysts. Local governments, which get a large chunk of their revenue from land sales, have an interest in keeping land and property prices high, analysts say.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Demand for U.K. homes has remained strong so far this year, pushing house prices higher in February for the 14th month in a row, according to a survey on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This trend looks sent to continue. Although there are signs that the supply of new homes in the U.K. is growing at the fastest pace since 2007, easier mortgage availability—in part aided by Government programs—has also boosted demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. lender Nationwide's monthly house price index—which is based on the value of the new mortgages it provides each month—rose 0.6% on the month and by 9.4% on the year in February. That was the highest annual gain since May 2010 and lifted the average house price to £177,846 pounds ($296,487).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Nationwide said house prices rose 0.8% on the month and by 8.8% on the year. The monthly gain was revised after the lender originally reported an increase of 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand continues to be supported by record low interest rates, improved credit availability and rising consumer confidence, thanks to the healthy gains in employment recorded in recent quarters," said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Price growth is being supported by the fact that the supply of housing remains constrained, with housing completions still well below their precrisis levels, which was already insufficient to keep up with the pace of household formation," Mr. Gardner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data show that, even after the withdrawal of the Funding for Lending Scheme from mortgages in November last year—which had encouraged lenders to increase their mortgage business—demand for homes remains strong. While the broader mortgage market is recovering, the Government's Help to Buy Scheme is also supporting mortgage growth, as it helps would-be buyers secure a mortgage large enough to enable them to purchase a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the latest Government data published Thursday showed the Help to Buy program has been used in 14,823 homes sales in the 10 months it has been open for business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in demand for homes has added upward pressure to house prices and comes despite 174,471 planning permission applications being granted in 2013, the highest number since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for home construction in the U.K. remains upbeat. A string of U.K. house builders announced financial results this week with all of them reporting healthy profits and forward sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barratt Developments PLC</span> was among the builders to report a rise in profits Thursday. Group Chief Executive Mark Clare said the outlook for the business and the sector is positive, but in order to ensure business growth continues, tough rules put in place during the downturn must continue to be adhered to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our forward order book is up 56% so we're positive in terms of output for the full year" Mr. Clare said. "We are equally positive for 2015 and we want to continue to grow business going forward," he told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barratt Developments</span> doesn't forecast U.K. house prices, but, Mr. Clare did say that, while house prices excluding London are still rising below the rate of inflation, they are beginning to "warm up".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As well as a slowdown in demand, signs of upward pressure in affordability would be a warning sign over house prices," Mr. Clare said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Clare also said that the price of land for residential building was "good," which encouraged development, but that at some point this would change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, while prices for residential land remain good value, the same cannot be said for farmland. According to the latest report from the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span>, the average price of farmland across England and Wales rose to a fresh record high in the second half of 2013 of £7,754 per acre, up 14% from the same period in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Farmland price growth has been enormous in recent years," said Jeremy Blackburn, RICS head of U.K. policy. "With commodity prices now having remained strong for some time, many farmers have been looking to expand their businesses and, with so little actually coming up for sale, competition for good land is fierce." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday, bringing the S&amp;P 500 back near record territory, as investors were cheered by a surprisingly strong report on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 37 points, or 0.2%, to 16217 in midday trading. On Tuesday, the Dow erased an early gain of as much as 59 points to close down 27 points, or 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 index advanced four points, or 0.3%, to 1849, and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index gained 24 points, or 0.6%, to 4311.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock benchmarks turned higher after the Commerce Department reported that U.S. new-home sales surged unexpectedly in January. New single-family home sales rose 9.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000, their highest level since July 2008. A decline of 3.1% was expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had some punkish readings on the housing market," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for <span class="companylink">Janney Montgomery Scott</span>. "The erosion we've seen. . .was a little disturbing. So this is kind of a breakthrough report."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. shares have rallied in recent weeks, recouping most of their losses from tumultuous January trading sparked by an emerging-market selloff. The S&amp;P 500 advanced into record territory on Monday and Tuesday, but both times failed to close above its all-time closing high of 1848.38, reached Jan. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 is up 3.9% for February, despite other recent disappointing economic releases, as investors contend the weakness is a result of bad weather in parts of the country, and therefore temporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said mortgage applications fell 8.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the latest week, with the purchase index dropping 4% to the lowest level since 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tesla Motors</span> climbed 3.7%. The stock has run up 18% over the past two sessions to an all-time high, ahead of an expected announcement of a battery-production partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's rallied 5.7% after the home-improvement retailer reported earnings that were in line with analyst estimates, and added $5 billion to its stock-buyback program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DreamWorks Animation retreated 13% after the computer-animation studio reported revenue that fell more than expected, offsetting adjusted earnings that were in line with forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> climbed 9.3% after reporting better-than-expected adjusted earnings, citing strength in its direct-to-consumer business and improving same-store sales trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares trimmed losses in afternoon action, but most markets still closed in the red. The Stoxx Europe 600 index , which closed at a six-year high on Tuesday, fell 0.2% to 337.70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeronimo Martins lost 6.5%, after the Portuguese retailer reported 2013 results that missed analysts forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks also were among decliners, with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span> down 2.5% after being criticized by U.S. senators over its role in tax evasion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Swiss Life Holding</span> jumped 6% after the insurer raised its dividend 22%. It also posted net income for 2013 that beat forecasts of analysts polled by Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</span> gave up 1.6% after <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> cut the luxury-goods firm to "underperform" from "neutral." The analysts said <span class="companylink">LVMH</span> is likely to underperform its peers in 2014 despite a diversified portfolio of brands with solid market positions and a strong management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GfK German consumer-climate indicator for March rose to a six-year high of 8.5 points, topping expectations of 8.2 points. In addition, the second estimate of fourth-quarter U.K. gross domestic product showed growth of 0.7%, matching expectations.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>1094 words</div><div>27 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank lending for land development and construction is turning up after hitting a 14-year low early last year, a sign that the supply crunch for new homes could ease in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. show that the outstanding balance on loans for land acquisition, development and construction rose in the fourth quarter to $209.9 billion, compared with $206 billion in the third quarter. While that's a relatively small gain, economists note that if the overall balance is growing it means that originations of new loans are likely rising even faster. It was the third consecutive quarter of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in lending would spur additional home construction and possibly put downward pressure on prices, which have been rising rapidly over the past two years and weighing on the housing recovery. Last year, the average price of a new U.S. home was $322,100, up 10.2% from 2012 and the highest annual figure since the Census Bureau began tracking new-home prices in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rising prices are great news for sellers, the tight supply of homes has priced many would-be buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Ray has spent six weeks combing the Tampa, Fla., market for a new home in his price range. So far, sticker shock has stymied his search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprised by how much higher prices are than he anticipated in the local market, where home values have increased by 44% from their nadir in late 2011 according to <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., Mr. Ray is reassessing his strategy. He and his wife, Teresa, have increased their budget to $210,000 from $175,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes me second-guess where I want to buy and, truly, do I really want to go above and beyond the amount of money I want to spend," said Mr. Ray, a 50-year-old property manager for a bank. "If you really find something you like, it's overbudget."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders started construction on 618,000 single-family homes last year, in contrast to the typical annual starts of 1 million units since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest increase in construction lending "is an encouraging signal," said David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, which forecasts a 33% increase to 822,000 single-family home starts this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lending remains far from peak, as outstanding land and construction loans topped out at $631.8 billion in the first quarter of 2008. "We still have a long way to go to get back to a normal flow of credit to builders," Mr. Crowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it can take from six months to more than two years for an increase in lending to show up in the housing supply -- depending on whether the loan is used for construction or land acquisition and development -- a pickup in building and a more-balanced market could boost the economy and kick the housing recovery into a new gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few industries stimulate growth as robustly as construction and home building, due to the jobs created and related spending on furniture and appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the FDIC issued its latest data, companies that build homes had noted a change in sentiment from lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I hadn't gotten calls for years from banks, but now I get calls from them all the time," said C. Pat DiFonzo, president and owner of housing developer <span class="companylink">Zena Land Development LP</span> in Grapevine, Texas. "They're all chasing deals now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other figures underscore the rebound in lending for residential projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the FDIC, outstanding loans solely for construction of homes -- excluding development, land acquisition and commercial projects -- increased to $43.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up from a recent low of $40.7 billion in last year's first quarter. The FDIC has tracked that measure only since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turnabout in lending comes at an inflection point for the broader housing industry. While few observers are predicting a downturn, by many measures sales of new and existing homes have slowed in recent months due to an increase in interest rates, steep gains in average home prices last year and unusually harsh weather in December and January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both home-construction starts and sales of existing homes declined in January, and several national home builders reported declines in new orders in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, census data released Wednesday showed sales of new homes in January at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000, up 9.6% from the revised rate in December and up 2.2% from January 2013. January typically is a slow month for home sales before the spring selling season, so the figures can fluctuate dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers say they are opening their doors a little wider to construction in part because borrowing by companies in other sectors has been weak. "The banks, especially the community and midsize banks here in Atlanta, can't get all of their loan growth," said Stephen Palmer, manager and chief financial officer of Home South Communities, a closely held builder in Atlanta. "I have today triple the commitments that I need for construction financing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lenders aren't keeping their doors tight, they aren't wide open either. Particularly difficult to obtain are loans for land acquisition and development, which entails installing infrastructure such as roads and utilities -- endeavors that lenders consider more risky than home construction. Smaller, cash-strapped builders still face a challenge in landing loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're still not able to get financing in the amounts and volumes needed for the industry," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. The builders association is shepherding the formation of two lending pools from which investors would make development and construction loans to small builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the added financing yields more housing supply, it will benefit first-time buyers like Samy Mikkilineni. The 33-year-old information-technology manager and her husband have searched for their first home in the Smyrna, Ga., area for four months, boosting their spending limit to $310,000 from $270,000. They're surprised by how much prices have climbed in the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looks like maybe we should have bought [a home] two years back," Ms. Mikkilineni said. "Maybe we'd have gotten a better deal. We feel that [prices] might go up a little more, so we want to do it now instead of waiting another year."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Justin Lahart </div><div>844 words</div><div>27 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers know that location is all. But it also is critical to investing in builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digging into where these companies stake out their ground offers a way of playing house-price trends, whether investors feel bullish or fear that rising interest rates will undermine prices. While exchange-traded funds often make it tempting to simply bet the sector, investors should recognize that exposure to different housing markets make, say, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> a very different company from <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So home builders shouldn't be lumped together. Yet they often are, with multiples of book value and earnings clustered around the sector median for most members of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> broad index of home-builder stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crucial difference between housing markets in places such as San Jose, Calif., and Austin, Texas -- more important than considerations like quality of life -- is the availability of land, according to <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> economist Albert Saiz. For a 2010 paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, he used satellite-based data to determine the amount of land available for development in 269 U.S. metropolitan areas, covering roughly three-quarters of the population. The more hills and other impediments an area has, the less land can be developed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Saiz gave each metro area an "elasticity score" -- the higher the number, the easier it is to put up a home. San Jose scored 0.76, ranking it the 10th most constrained among the 100 largest areas by population. Austin, scoring 3.0, ranked a decidedly easier 88th. The range for all 100 was 0.6 to 5.5. Mr. Saiz found the scores correlate with other constraints, such as zoning and taxes. Since he did his analysis, the scores have likely changed only a little, if at all, as they reflect land-use fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tapping this data, economists Atif Mian at <span class="companylink">Princeton University</span> and Amir Sufi at the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago's Booth School of Business</span> have shown that more constrained areas saw bigger booms in the housing bubble -- but also bigger busts on the way down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So home builders' fortunes -- and risks -- are tied to where they sell houses. Those heavily concentrated in more constrained areas suffered for it. Among them: one-time stock market darling <span class="companylink">WCI Communities</span>, a Florida-based builder that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While house prices in constrained areas have bounced around more than in less-restricted areas, they also have done better over the long haul. Consider two gauges of home prices, one made up of the 10 most elastic areas in 20 separate S&amp;P/Case-Shiller metropolitan home-price indexes, the other of the 10 least-flexible areas. The latter is more volatile but up 65% since January 2000. The former is up 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting a precise bead on the builders' exposures to different cities isn't possible and constraints can differ markedly even within cities. The delineations of the metro areas Mr. Saiz used are slightly different than what the Census Bureau now uses. But data on communities where the builders sell homes serve as a useful proxy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To analyze this, The Wall Street Journal paired <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s community counts for 15 listed builders with Mr. Saiz's scores. Each metro area in which a builder operates is weighted: If it has 10 communities in the Dallas area and five around Miami, Dallas matters twice as much. The small fraction of communities not within the areas Mr. Saiz analyzed is excluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Homes</span> scores lowest at 0.9, indicating it is weighted towards more constrained areas. The California builder has moved to broaden its portfolio, agreeing late last year to buy Weyerhaeuser's home-building business. Still, at the time, TRI noted that business had ownership or control of "approximately 27,000 lots primarily located in high-growth, lot-constrained markets." Other builders with low scores include Toll and <span class="companylink">M.D.C. Holdings</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end of the spectrum is <span class="companylink">LGI Homes</span>, scoring 2.2, with its large number of communities in Texas. The likes of LGI -- along with Horton and <span class="companylink">Ryland Group</span>, which also score highly -- should offer investors relative insulation if house prices crack. In periods of growth, they should generate steady profits as they buy land, build on it and sell. Their biggest risk may be that they operate in markets where barriers to entry are lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constrained builders, conversely, must navigate markets where securing land can be tricky and there can be sudden price declines. But when prices rise, they can do very well, making them more suited for investors with a broadly bullish view on U.S. property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With house prices supported to some extent by ultralow interest rates -- and the vagaries of Federal Reserve tapering -- buying America's builders is especially fraught with uncertainty. Rather than being all over the map, investors can, and should, pick their spot.</p>

Treasury bonds rose, boosted by worries over Ukraine and a strong government bond auction. U.S. oil prices advanced on a smaller-than-expected increase in crude inventories, while gold futures fell and the dollar rose after a strong report on new home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPENING CALL:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings season continues in force Thursday in Hong Kong -- tycoon Li Ka-shing 's property flagship <span class="companylink">Cheung Kong Holdings</span> is expected to report fourth-quarter figures as is his conglomerate <span class="companylink">Hutchison Whampoa Ltd</span> . Other companies reporting include retailer <span class="companylink">Giordano International</span> , Chinese wireless carrier <span class="companylink">China Unicom</span> , and shipper <span class="companylink">Pacific Basin Shipping</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EQUITIES:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stock benchmarks closed slightly higher, while the S&amp;P 500 failed to hold in record closing territory for a third-straight session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said activity was light, and largely driven by short-term players waiting to see if the S&amp;P can hold all-time closing highs before buying or selling. On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 ventured near to record territory during the session but retreated from those levels midday. On Monday and Tuesday, the index also pushed near all-time highs before pulling back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks initially gained in midmorning trading after a housing report, a bright spot in an otherwise downbeat string of reports from the sector in recent weeks. Sales of new single-family homes surged 9.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000, the Commerce Department reported, the highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate action, Target shares rallied 7% after the company reported profit that fell by less than Wall Street analysts expected, though the retailer was hit by fallout from its holiday data breach and losses from its push into Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> rose 5.4% after the home-improvement retailer reported earnings in line with analyst estimates, and added $5 billion to its stock-buyback program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia, China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% to snap a four-session losing streak, while Japan's Nikkei Stock Average lost 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREX:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rose against major currencies, receiving a boost from unexpectedly robust U.S. housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing data over the past couple of months have come in on the downside so much recently that a good housing report might provide some upside support on the dollar," said Robert Lynch, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent string of disappointing data amid severe winter weather have made it difficult to gain an accurate picture of the strength or weakness of the U.S. economy, which guides dollar price movements on a macro level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro dropped against the dollar early in the New York session following news that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered surprise military exercises for 150,000 soldiers throughout the country, including those based in proximity to Ukraine's northern border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell against other major currencies, including 0.3% against both the yen and the pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BONDS:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury bonds rose for a second straight session, boosted by worries over Ukraine and a strong five-year <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bought Treasurys after President Vladimir Putin ordered a test of combat readiness for troops in several parts of Russia. While Russia's defense minister insisted it had nothing to do with unrest in Ukraine, the development added to investors' anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russia's ruble and Ukraine's hryvnia sold off while government bonds in Ukraine fell. The news overshadowed a U.S. report that showed a 9.6% rise in new homes sales last month, which contrasts with some disappointing releases on the housing market earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $35 billion sale of five-year Treasury notes saw strong demand, giving the bond market an extra boost. The new five-year notes were sold at a yield of 1.530%. The auction attracted $2.98 in bids for each dollar offered, the most since September 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMODITIES:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. oil prices rose after weekly U.S. inventory data showed a smaller-than-expected increase in national crude supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of crude stored in the U.S. increased by just 68,000 barrels, well below the 800,000-barrel increase analysts projected in a survey by The Wall Street Journal and estimated by an industry trade group, the <span class="companylink">American Petroleum Institute</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the smallest weekly increase since June, suggesting that demand for crude may be stronger than the market expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A severe winter across much of the U.S. has boosted demand for crude, which can be refined to produce heating oil to warm homes and businesses, and helped oil prices climb to a four-month high last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span> reported Wednesday that crude stored in a major hub fell by 1.1 million barrels. Improvements in the nation's oil infrastructure have enabled greater shipments of crude from the hub in Cushing, Okla., to Gulf Coast refineries, where it can be processed and sold to meet overseas demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold futures fell, ending a three-day winning streak after stronger-than-expected housing data prompted some investors to lock in recent gains.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>542 words</div><div>26 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices last year posted their largest annual gain since 2005, according to a report released Tuesday, but signs are emerging that price gains are leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. prices increased 11.3% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price index. The Case-Shiller index that measures home prices in 20 major metro areas rose 13.4% over the same span. A separate index, released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, said prices had gone up 7.7%, also to an eight-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are proving to be a double-edged sword because, together with higher mortgage rates, they are reducing affordability, which has curbed sales. "Home prices will probably go up this year, but not like they've been," said Robert Shiller, the <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> economist who co-founded the index that bears his name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller said that last summer's surge in mortgage rates, which jumped from around 3.5% in early May to 4.5% by June, had taken a toll on housing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rebounded strongly over the past two years as low prices and rates attracted strong demand first from investors and later from traditional buyers who competed over a shrinking supply. Higher prices have led investors to slow their purchases in more markets, while rising rates have dented affordability for owners who need a mortgage, especially first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices declined 0.1% in December from November in the 20-city index, the second straight monthly decline. Sales tend to slow in the winter, which can lead to softer prices, but the monthly declines during the fourth quarter were still the smallest for that period in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent measures of housing sales have pointed to weaker activity, which could drag on economic growth if they don't rebound during the spring selling season. Sales of previously owned homes fell by 5.1% in January from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last week. The Commerce Department is set to report Wednesday on new-home sales for January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives say as housing costs rise, buyers are becoming more selective. "A house with a $1,600 mortgage payment last year now has a $2,000 mortgage payment. Buyers are saying, 'I better like it,' " said Glenn Kelman, chief executive at Redfin, a national brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's home-price report, along with other data from <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., point to a deceleration in home prices in many of the markets that have posted the largest rebounds over the past two years. Home prices in Phoenix fell by 0.3% in December, breaking a streak of 27 consecutive monthly gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any moderation in home prices could tamp down concerns that prices were rising unsustainably fast relative to incomes. On the whole, U.S. home prices have risen 21% after hitting bottom in early 2012, according to Tuesday's report. Prices, which fell 35% between 2006 and 2012, are now 21% below their previous peak and back at levels seen in mid-2004.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Land Investors Phase Down --- Several Big Developers Are Selling Tracts Amid Forecasts of Slowing Price Gains</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>930 words</div><div>26 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas developer H. Ross Perot Jr. and a few other big land investors are taking some chips off the table, betting that the swift increase in prices on residential land in recent years will abate in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists predict home prices this year will increase by roughly half of their percentage gain in 2013, when they rose by an average of 11.3%, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index of home prices. The direction of home prices heavily influences what home builders will pay for land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless home prices go higher, I don't see land [prices] going much higher," says Mr. Perot, whose <span class="companylink">Hillwood Development Co</span>. owns 9,400 residential acres in seven states. His father founded <span class="companylink">Electronic Data Systems</span> and was a presidential candidate in 1992 and 1996. "Land's about as expensive as it can be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillwood sold 13 residential tracts totaling 4,300 acres in the past year for $125 million, nearly double the amount it had invested in them. Hillwood also bought two tracts last year totaling 1,800 acres, but 2013 was the first year in the past 10 that Hillwood was a net land seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unusual for Hillwood to sell huge tracts of raw land. Typically, the company develops tracts into dozens or hundreds of home lots -- with electricity, roads and other infrastructure -- and sells them piecemeal to multiple home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Texas land investor, Stratford Land Co., intends to complete sales of at least $400 million of land early this year after selling $100 million of land last year and $150 million in 2012. To sell, Stratford looks to double the money it spent on the land. It still holds about $1 billion of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to take some chips off the table," Stratford founder and CEO Phillip Wiggins said in an interview. "It seems like we've timed this very well. But we have the rest of the portfolio to play a little long on, because we think there's still some wind behind our sails for a few years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment-management firm <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. since 2009 has amassed more than 20 residential projects spanning 30,000 lots in distressed markets. Last year, Paulson for the first time since then sold tracts in a few markets, though it intends to also keep buying and holding land in markets where it thinks prices still have room to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a result, we have been measured in our sales activity over the past year," says Michael Barr, portfolio manager for the Paulson Real Estate Funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Starwood Land Ventures LLC</span>, an arm of investor Barry Sternlicht's <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>, since 2007 has amassed a portfolio spanning roughly 17,000 lots, buying mostly at the market's nadir in 2009 and 2010. Last year, Starwood Land posted its largest year of land sales, divesting tracts totaling 2,300 lots for $150 million. Meanwhile, it bought one tract of 675 lots for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market was right and the prices were very good -- in some cases above what they were in the peak years," says Mike Moser, Starwood Land's co-CEO. "So, it's time to start harvesting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has been hot for residential land because home builders have been trying to ramp up their production as the housing market has recovered. Last year, builders started construction of an estimated 618,300 single-family homes, up 15.5% from 2012, but still roughly half of historical averages, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> predicts builders will start construction of 822,000 single-family homes this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lot prices in 2013 increased more than 20% on average nationally from 2012 levels, according to housing-research and analysis firm Zelman &amp; Associates. In red-hot California, lot prices increased in Modesto by 73% in the past year, according to land brokerage Land Advisors Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the land market lost momentum late last year as home buyers began to balk at rising prices and higher interest rates. That weakening of demand tempered home builders' appetite for top-dollar land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at the sequential, quarter-to-quarter change in land prices underscores the cooling of the market. According to Zelman's monthly surveys of builders, brokers and developers in 55 major markets, prices of finished lots receded from their biggest recent gain -- 6.8% in the first quarter of 2013 from the previous quarter -- to a more tepid 2.9% gain in last year's fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and market observers now predict smaller price gains -- and, in some cases, flat prices -- for land in 2014. "We expect the pace of acceleration to ease," Zelman analyst Ryan McKeveny said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the investors that sold land in the past year will remain in the business. Mr. Perot's Hillwood intends to develop another 1,600 lots this year, mostly in Texas. That includes its 1,000-acre Harvest project north of Fort Worth, which includes a working farm, a community garden, a man-made lake, an activities coordinator and automation systems in every home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're sellers at the right price at the right time and the right circumstance," says Fred Balda, president of Hillwood's residential-development division. "We were fortunate to have that [scenario] the last couple of years. But we're not vacating our core business."</p>

</div><div class="author">James Ramage </div><div>463 words</div><div>26 February 2014</div><div>11:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK—The dollar rose against major currencies Wednesday, receiving a boost from unexpectedly robust U.S. housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greenback gained 0.2% to 102.45 yen, while the euro slipped 0.5% to $1.3684. The dollar gained 0.5% against the Swiss franc and 0.1% versus the British pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said new home sales in January rose to their highest level since July 2008. Sales of new home climbed 9.6% last month to 468,000, easily outpacing forecasts of around 401,000, while sales in December were revised upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing data over the past couple of months have come in on the downside so much recently that a good housing report might provide some upside support on the dollar," said Robert Lynch, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent string of disappointing data amid severe winter weather have made it difficult to gain an accurate picture of the strength or weakness of the U.S. economy, which guides dollar price movements on a macro level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve could elect to postpone its measured reduction of asset purchases should it decide, after weighing the figures, that the economy isn't showing enough of a recovery. Such a move would hurt the dollar's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro dropped against the dollar early in the New York session Wednesday following news that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered surprise military exercises for 150,000 soldiers throughout the country, including those based in proximity to Ukraine's northern border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Russia's defense minister insisted the move wasn't related to current political developments in Ukraine, rising tensions between the two countries have spooked investors. Analysts noted that energy flows to Europe from Russia pass through Ukraine. In addition, Eastern European countries have greatly ramped up their exports to the euro zone. Disruptions to either would likely affect economies within the currency bloc and consequently hurt the euro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Ukraine-Russia news has grabbed headlines and shaken euro-dollar out of an almost sleepy sideways bias," Mr. Lynch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell against other major currencies Wednesday, including 0.3% against both the yen and the pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar rose against most emerging-market currencies, gaining 1.2% against the Turkish lira, to 2.2416, and 1.0% against the South African rand and the Hungarian forint, to 10.8350 and 226.87, respectively.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes surged unexpectedly in January, easing concerns about a deeper housing-sector slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales rose 9.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000 from a month earlier, reaching their highest level since July 2008, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. From a year ago, new-home sales were up 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's increase was boosted by sales in the Northeast, where activity expanded by 73.7% and reversed the prior month's declines. The South and West also saw gains, but new home sales in the Midwest fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales measures are typically choppy around this time of year as snowstorms and cooler temperatures can shutter construction sites and discourage people from venturing out to look at properties. Because the level of activity is so low, seasonal adjustments can magnify month-to-month changes, said <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span> chief economist Stephen Stanley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures come after months of slowdown that many economists are attributing at least in part to the tough winter that much of the country experienced. "This was a perplexing report," said Millan Mulraine at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of improvement for the housing market, home prices last year posted their largest annual gain since 2005, according to the Standard Poor's/Case-Shiller price index Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales figures "will raise more questions as to how much of the recent weakness—not only in housing, but other data as well—is due to the weather," said economists at <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates and home prices could encourage prospective home buyers to move quickly. Some economists say this pent-up demand will help drive traffic and activity in the months ahead. Indeed, a separate Commerce Department report last week said permits for new homes, a sign of future demand, were up from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, other housing-market indicators are showing signs of weakness. Construction of new homes tumbled last month, the Commerce Department said last week. And a measure of sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in January as well, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> report last week. Those sales, which make up the bulk of home transactions, were down to the lowest level in 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales peaked in July 2005, when they hit an annual pace of nearly 1.4 million. Sales hit a low of 270,000 in February 2011.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos   </div><div>681 words</div><div>26 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices last year posted their largest annual gain since 2005, according to a report released Tuesday, but signs are emerging that price gains are leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. prices rose 11.3% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price index. The Case-Shiller index that measures home prices in 20 major metro areas rose 13.4% during the same span. A separate index, released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, said prices had gone up 7.7%, also to an eight-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are proving to be a double-edged sword because, together with higher mortgage rates, they are reducing affordability, which has curbed sales. "Home prices will probably go up this year, but not like they've been," said Robert Shiller, the <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> economist who co-founded the index that bears his name. Mr. Shiller said last year's spike in mortgage rates, which jumped from around 3.5% in early May to 4.5% by June, had taken a toll on housing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rebounded strongly during the past two years as low prices and rates attracted brisk demand, first from investors and later from traditional buyers who competed over a shrinking supply. Higher prices have led investors to slow their purchases in more markets, while rising rates have dented affordability for owners who need a mortgage, especially first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that [the entry-level] market is not participating in the recovery as it normally has," said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices decreased 0.1% in December from November in the 20-city index, the second straight monthly decline. Sales tend to slow in the winter, which can lead to softer prices, but the monthly declines during the fourth quarter were still the smallest for that period in eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent measures of housing sales have pointed to weaker activity, which could drag on economic growth if they don't rebound during the spring selling season. Sales of previously owned homes fell by 5.1% in January from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives say as housing costs rise, buyers are becoming more selective. "A house with a $1,600 mortgage payment last year now has a $2,000 mortgage payment. Buyers are saying, 'I better like it,' " said Glenn Kelman, chief executive at Redfin, a national brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders during the past year have boosted profits by building more-expensive homes. Luxury builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. on Tuesday reported a 21% increase in its average sale price during the quarter that ended in January versus the previous-year period. But those price gains appear to be curbing sales volumes. Toll said new contracts for homes in the quarter fell 6% from a year earlier and it cut its forecast for total closings for its 2014 fiscal year by 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's home-price report, along with other data from <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., points to a deceleration in home prices in many of the markets that have posted the largest rebounds during the past two years. Home prices in Phoenix fell by 0.3% in December, breaking a streak of 27 consecutive monthly gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities reported annual gains last year, with the largest in Las Vegas (25.5%), San Francisco (22.6%) and Los Angeles (20.3%). Those have seen the pace of increases slow since last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any moderation in home prices could ease concerns that prices were rising unsustainably fast relative to incomes. On the whole, U.S. home prices have risen 21% after hitting bottom in early 2012, according to Tuesday's Case-Shiller report. Prices, which fell 35% between 2006 and 2012, are now 21% below their previous peak and back at levels seen in mid-2004.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas developer H. Ross Perot Jr. and a few other big land investors are taking some chips off the table, betting that the swift increase in prices on residential land in recent years will abate in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists predict home prices this year will increase by roughly half of their percentage gain in 2013, when they rose by an average of 11.3%, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national index of home prices. The direction of home prices heavily influences what home builders will pay for land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unless home prices go higher, I don't see land [prices] going much higher," says Mr. Perot, whose <span class="companylink">Hillwood Development Co</span>. owns 9,400 residential acres in seven states. His father founded <span class="companylink">Electronic Data Systems</span> and was a presidential candidate in 1992 and 1996. "Land's about as expensive as it can be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillwood sold 13 residential tracts totaling 4,300 acres in the past year for $125 million, nearly double the amount it had invested in them. Hillwood also bought two tracts last year totaling 1,800 acres, but 2013 was the first year in the past 10 that Hillwood was a net land seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unusual for Hillwood to sell huge tracts of raw land. Typically, the company develops tracts into dozens or hundreds of home lots—with electricity, roads and other infrastructure—and sells them piecemeal to multiple home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Texas land investor, Stratford Land Co., intends to complete sales of at least $400 million of land early this year after selling $100 million of land last year and $150 million in 2012. To sell, Stratford looks to double the money it spent on the land. It still holds about $1 billion of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to take some chips off the table," Stratford founder and CEO Phillip Wiggins said in an interview. "It seems like we've timed this very well. But we have the rest of the portfolio to play a little long on, because we think there's still some wind behind our sails for a few years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment-management firm <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>. since 2009 has amassed more than 20 residential projects spanning 30,000 lots in distressed markets. Last year, Paulson for the first time since then sold tracts in a few markets, though it intends to also keep buying and holding land in markets where it thinks prices still have room to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As a result, we have been measured in our sales activity over the past year," says Michael Barr, portfolio manager for the Paulson Real Estate Funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Starwood Land Ventures LLC</span>, an arm of investor Barry Sternlicht's <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>, since 2007 has amassed a portfolio spanning roughly 17,000 lots, buying mostly at the market's nadir in 2009 and 2010. Last year, Starwood Land posted its largest year of land sales, divesting tracts totaling 2,300 lots for $150 million. Meanwhile, it bought one tract of 675 lots for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market was right and the prices were very good—in some cases above what they were in the peak years," says Mike Moser, Starwood Land's co-CEO. "So, it's time to start harvesting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has been hot for residential land because home builders have been trying to ramp up their production as the housing market has recovered. Last year, builders started construction of an estimated 618,300 single-family homes, up 15.5% from 2012, but still roughly half of historical averages, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> predicts builders will start construction of 822,000 single-family homes this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lot prices in 2013 increased more than 20% on average nationally from 2012 levels, according to housing-research and analysis firm Zelman &amp; Associates. In red-hot California, lot prices increased in Modesto by 73% in the past year, according to land brokerage Land Advisors Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the land market lost momentum late last year as home buyers began to balk at rising prices and higher interest rates. That weakening of demand tempered home builders' appetite for top-dollar land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at the sequential, quarter-to-quarter change in land prices underscores the cooling of the market. According to Zelman's monthly surveys of builders, brokers and developers in 55 major markets, prices of finished lots receded from their biggest recent gain—6.8% in the first quarter of 2013 from the previous quarter—to a more tepid 2.9% gain in last year's fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and market observers now predict smaller price gains—and, in some cases, flat prices—for land in 2014. "We expect the pace of acceleration to ease," Zelman analyst Ryan McKeveny said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the investors that sold land in the past year will remain in the business. Mr. Perot's Hillwood intends to develop another 1,600 lots this year, mostly in Texas. That includes its 1,000-acre Harvest project north of Fort Worth, which includes a working farm, a community garden, a man-made lake, an activities coordinator and automation systems in every home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're sellers at the right price at the right time and the right circumstance," says Fred Balda, president of Hillwood's residential-development division. "We were fortunate to have that [scenario] the last couple of years. But we're not vacating our core business."</p>

</div><div class="author">Shelly Banjo </div><div>612 words</div><div>25 February 2014</div><div>09:25</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>. is adding more upscale items to its lineup, as its customers show a willingness to splurge on their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The giant home-improvement retailer said sales of premium products have posted four straight quarters of growth. The results highlight the growing divergence between chains that can cash in on wealthier shoppers who benefit from rising home and stock prices, and retailers like <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>. that cater to lower-end customers and are suffering because of reductions in federal food stamp outlays and unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s customers are spending more. The number of shopping trips where customers spent more than $900 increased by 5.5% in the three months ended Feb. 2, compared with a 2.5% increase for tickets under $50. Those bigger tickets helped sales excluding newly opened or closed stores rise 4.9% in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to make sure we have products across the entire price spectrum, but we are adding on the higher end and also adding products with innovation that would come with a premium price," Chief Financial Officer Carol Tomé said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> this spring will introduce a higher-end patio furniture line, a new gourmet barbecue system and a toilet seat that comes with an integrated LED light. It is also adding new products at lower price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> were up 2.7% after the company said its earnings slipped to $1.01 billion in the quarter from $1.02 billion a year earlier, when the period had an extra week due to the oddities of the retail calendar. Net sales fell 3% to $17.7 billion. Excluding the additional week, which added about $1.2 billion in sales, sales were up 3.9% from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online sales rose by about 50% to $2.7 billion last year and continue to be a focus for the company. The retailer will spend roughly 40% of the $1.5 billion in planned capital expenditures this year on "interconnected retail" and information technology, Ms. Tomé said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of recovery in the housing market have helped boost results for home-improvement retailers such as <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>., which is due to report earnings Wednesday. The improved results have bucked the overall weak trend for retailers, many of which have pointed to the harsh winter for disappointing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> said it expects sales to increase by 4.6% for the new fiscal year, excluding newly opened or closed stores, as well as revenue growth of 4.8%. In December, the company had forecast new-year revenue growth of 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower outlook reflects expectations of a weaker dollar. The company also expects the lift from housing to slow as prices decelerate, new home formation remains soft and credit availability remains tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to get those millennials into a home," Ms. Tomé said. "We would have hoped in a recovering environment that young people would be able to move out of parents' homes and into their own homes, so the fact household formation dropped was sort of surprising."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it expects home prices to appreciate in 2014 at half the rate they appreciated in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last year, we saw strong recovery in housing prices and we expect it to continue, but at a lower rate," Ms. Tomé said. "While some of the housing data has softened, we continue to believe we're in a moderate stage of recovery."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices last year posted their largest annual gain since 2005, according to a report released Tuesday, but signs are emerging that price gains are leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. prices rose 11.3% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price index. The Case-Shiller index that measures home prices in 20 major metro areas rose 13.4% during the same span.

"Home prices will probably go up this year, but not like they've been," said Robert Shiller, the <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> economist who co-founded the index that bears his name. "It's going to slow down." Mr. Shiller said last year's spike in mortgage rates, which jumped from around 3.5% in early May to 4.5% by June, had taken a toll on housing activity. While interest rates are "still low," the sudden increase "has offset the wild enthusiasm to buy a house that a lot of people felt in 2012," Mr. Shiller said. "We're seeing the impetus for the recent increase pulled out with the rise in mortgage rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rebounded strongly during the past two years as low prices and rates attracted brisk demand, first from investors and later from traditional buyers who competed over a shrinking supply.

Toll said new contracts for homes in the quarter fell 6% from a year earlier and it cut its forecast for total closings for its 2014 fiscal year by 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National builder <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc</span>. began increasing certain incentives in mid-January to boost sagging sales, J. Larry Sorsby, the company's finance chief, said at an investor conference Tuesday. Incentives typically include free upgrades on home finishes or assistance with closing costs, which reduce builders' profit margins. Hovnanian said Monday that its revenue increase for the quarter ending in January would be "meaningfully lower than anticipated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market's not bad—don't misunderstand what I'm saying," Mr. Sorsby said. "We're just disappointed that we're not back to last year's levels."</p>

</div><div class="author">Kosaku Narioka </div><div>486 words</div><div>25 February 2014</div><div>06:33</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO—The price of land in Japan's major cities climbed in the final months of 2013, as easy money washing through the financial system found its way into commercial and residential property investments, guided by growing confidence in the longer-term economic outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in more than two-thirds of places surveyed between October and December, a report released on Tuesday by the land ministry showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's property market has been showing signs of life after being comatose since the collapse of the asset bubble in the early 1990s. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s loose monetary policy has kept interest rates ultralow, while improving economic sentiment and expectations for higher prices ahead have encouraged banks to lend and people to buy property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Monetary easing has supplied ample funds to the market, and investment is getting hot," said Shigeo Hirayama, head of research at Urban Research Institute Corp., a real-estate research and consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly survey of residential and commercial land showed that prices rose in 122 locations of 150 surveyed. The gains were lead by Tokyo's upscale Ginza shopping district and the area in front of the train station in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, home to auto maker <span class="companylink">Toyota Motor Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to conventional buyers such as railroad companies and warehouse firms, regional banks and some domestic pension funds have entered the market because yields on Japanese government bonds—their traditional investment destination—remain low under the central bank's easing policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said some Asian and American long-term funds have started to invest in Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some competition is unavoidable," said Yasuo Kono, Japan strategist at <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span>, which has $46.3 billion assets under management. "Demand for investing in good properties will likely persist."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property prices have also likely been helped by buying ahead of a sales-tax increase in April. But real-estate experts aren't necessarily anticipating sharp falls in demand after the levy goes up, because underlying economic conditions are expected to be largely unchanged, and another increase in the sales tax is planned for October 2015.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's yuan hit a four-month low Monday, dragging down other currencies in the region and fueling speculation that years of gains may be nearing an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that global investors are retreating from bets on further appreciation, the offshore yuan, which is freely traded, fell to the same level as its onshore counterpart, which is strictly controlled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yuan is entering its second week of declines triggered by a surprise move by the central bank to guide it lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say China is aiming to force out speculators seeking to profit from gains in the currency, and to stem heavy inflows from abroad that flood the country with excess cash and hurt efforts to curb credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS AG</span>, one of the world's biggest currency traders, said the central bank's recent moves signal a change in policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Chinese government appears to want increased flexibility in the yuan's exchange rate, rather than continued strengthening," <span class="companylink">UBS</span> economist Wang Tao said. "The era of steady [yuan] appreciation may be drawing to a close."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said exporters were feeling the pain from a currency that had been rising until recently, and forecast a largely stable yuan for the rest of the year at about 6.1 per dollar. The dollar was trading at 6.0984 yuan late Monday, compared with 6.0913 on Friday. A higher number means a weaker Chinese yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The People's Bank of China</span> sets a daily reference rate for the yuan, allowing it to trade 1% higher or lower each day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in the currency comes as concerns mount over slowing growth in the world's second-biggest economy and signs of rising financial stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property stocks were slammed Monday on news that developers in two cities in eastern China had started to cut prices of new homes in a bid to spur sales, raising fresh concerns about the health of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The shift in [yuan] dynamics was mainly driven by several factors: weakening economic outlook, policy shift and technical adjustment by market investors," analysts from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yuan's slide is having ripple effects on currencies in other Asian nations with close trading ties to China. The South Korean won hit its lowest level in more than two weeks against the U.S. dollar. The currencies of Singapore and Taiwan also had heavy selloffs last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullish bets had buoyed the yuan since the beginning of the year, according to traders and analysts, driven by hopes that the currency would keep appreciating as China continued to promote its international use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were way too many structured products [betting on yuan appreciation] bought by private-bank investors and wealthy individuals," said Eric Yum, head of offshore yuan and Hong Kong dollar trading at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. "Panic selloff was triggered when the <span class="companylink">PBOC</span> kept fixing the yuan at weaker levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot-money inflows -- defined as net capital inflows not intended for foreign direct investment -- accounted for more than $150 billion of the $433 billion increase in China's foreign-exchange reserves in 2013, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> said. That had been helping to push up the yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some reckon, though, that China's long-term policy to let the yuan appreciate won't change much, given Beijing's plan to internationalize its currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, they figure, the central bank may be reluctant to let the yuan become too weak because that could trigger outflows from investors and multinational companies operating in China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's <span class="companylink">Industrial Bank Co</span>., a midsize bank, said Monday it has stopped issuing some new loans to property developers.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>809 words</div><div>24 February 2014</div><div>07:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—China's red-hot property market is showing its strongest signs yet of a cool-down, as price growth eases, credit for many developers dries up, and some start to cut prices at new housing projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential slowdown could be welcomed by Beijing, which for more than four years has tried to cool the market to keep the high cost of housing from becoming a political and social problem. But a sharp slowdown could hit the Chinese economy just as growth is slowing, and the central government is looking for ways to keep it steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest sign came Monday as new home price acceleration in China's biggest cities showed its first slowdown in a year. It follows indications from banks and developers that lenders are treating the sector with increasing caution amid worries about possible bad loans. On Monday, China's Industrial Bank Co. confirmed that it stopped issuing some new loans to property developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, developers are also worried about an oversupply of homes. Developer DoThink Group last week said it cut prices by 12.2% at its North Sea Park project in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou to 15,800 yuan ($2,592) per square meter from 18,000 yuan per square meter. It said late last week it started discounting apartments at its 12-tower high-rise project, which had been on sale in phases since April 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the price cuts in Hangzhou and in the nearby city of Changzhou are an indication that those places have an oversupply of housing, which could spread to larger cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The risk in the property sector is currently underappreciated, and the price cuts in Changzhou and Hangzhou are worrying signals worth investor attention," said Nomura economist Zhiwei Zhang in written comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A sharp slowdown in property investment is possible and would increase systemic risks," Mr. Zhang wrote. He added that the sector's "contribution to GDP growth has been critically important over the past five years, and the government may not have the proper policy tools to manage a situation where oversupply eventually causes property prices to fall, particularly in third- and fourth-tier cities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results released Monday marked the first slowdown since home prices first began surging in January 2013, after a sluggish 2012. Shares of <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, the nation's largest property developer by revenue, closed 6.6% lower Monday, and <span class="companylink">Poly Real Estate Group</span> fell 8.5%. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has been grappling with a resurgent property market in big cities that has resisted government curbs aimed at reining in high prices. The boom has also contributed to growing supplies of new homes in smaller cities, raising concerns about a sharp drop in prices and deteriorating loan quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average new-home prices in 70 Chinese cities rose about 9% in January from a year earlier, according to Wall Street Journal calculations based on data released on Monday by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Statistics</span>. While that figure shows China's housing market remains frothy, it also marks a drop from December's 9.2% rise as well as November's 9.1% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The oversupply situation has a greater bearing on slowing down the property market this year. The current liquidity tightness is unlikely to last into the second half, because economic growth isn't that great," said Nicole Wong, a property analyst at CLSA. "Property-price growth this year will decelerate, and in some cities, there will be price cuts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial Bank, a midsize lender, said on Monday in a filing to the <span class="companylink">Shanghai Stock Exchange</span> that it had halted some types of property loans until the end of March, when it will unveil new policies. The bank said the move is aimed at "adjusting its asset structure and to better serve the real economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have periodically tightened lending to developers; the last time was in 2010-2012 when the government worried that easy credit was helping drive up prices. Worries about a slowing economy led to a loosening in early 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now banks are growing cautious about lending to developers, especially those active in smaller cities that face an oversupply of housing, and Beijing is concerned about a buildup of debt and unoccupied housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Changzhou, the developers of a 21-tower project announced discounts last week. Prices were reduced to an average of 7,000 yuan per square meter, with some units selling for 5,380 yuan per square meter, down from an 11,000-yuan price tag in December, according to data from property broker <span class="companylink">SouFun Holdings</span>. One of the developers, <span class="companylink">Agile Property Holdings</span>, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns over the Chinese property market weighed on investor sentiment in Asia Monday, sending many of the region's stock markets lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shanghai Composite lost 1.7% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.7% after Chinese local media reported mainland bank <span class="companylink">Industrial Bank Co</span>. stopped lending to property developers. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tightening "was translated by investors as a precaution against a potential weakening of the property sector," said Li Wenjie, an analyst with investment advisory firm CEBM Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data Monday showing that Chinese new home prices in January rose 9% from a year earlier—slightly slower than 9.2% in December—also suggested a tighter lending environment in the country. Large property developers fell sharply, with <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>. sinking 4.9% in Shenzhen and <span class="companylink">Gemdale Corp</span>. plunging 7.7% in Shanghai. In Hong Kong, <span class="companylink">China Overseas Land &amp; Investment Ltd</span>. fell 3.6% while <span class="companylink">China Resources Land Ltd</span>. fell 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Away from China, the main economic news over the weekend came from Australia. G-20 officials ended a summit there by saying that they would look to boost global growth by more than $2 trillion over the next few years under a strategy from the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, advanced economies would continue to with their easy money policies, while emerging markets would work to restructure their economies and keep inflation at bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The G-20 news helped much of Asia started the day in positive territory, but China property worries eventually weighed on the region. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5% to 1949.05, while Singapore's Straits Times Index was flat late in Asia. Indonesia's JSX was 0.2% lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nikkei ended down 0.2% at 14837.68 as the yen strengthened slightly in Asian trade. The dollar was last at ¥102.33, compared with ¥102.48 late Friday in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exchange rate between the dollar and the yen could be impacted later in the week by a string of upcoming U.S. economic indicators—such as January new home sales and durable goods orders, as well as revised fourth-quarter gross domestic product figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 ended up less than 0.1% at 5440.20 as the market gave up nearly all of its early gains from early in the session after Chinese markets opened meekly. In addition, a number of major stocks going ex-dividend also weighed on the market—meaning new buyers of stock will no longer receive the next dividend. Retailer <span class="companylink">Wesfarmers</span> lost 2.3% and <span class="companylink">Telstra Corp</span>. was 2.5% lower.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>633 words</div><div>24 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Garden City Hotel</span> is working to wrap up a major overhaul costing more than $40 million, the latest of several rebuilds in its 100-year-plus history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation of the hotel -- some of its 272 rooms began reopening last week -- is one of the latest signs of new investment in the Long Island village about 20 miles from Manhattan. One of the country's first planned suburban communities, Garden City has attracted some of New York City's most prolific real estate families, including the Pilevskys, the Moinians and the Albanese.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris Moinian, who is the brother of well-known Manhattan developer Joe Moinian, has led the <span class="companylink">Garden City Hotel</span> project. Morris Moinian heads up Fortuna Realty Group, which purchased the <span class="companylink">Garden City Hotel</span> in 2012 and also has developed The <span class="companylink">Dylan Hotel</span> at 52 E. 41st St. and Chelsea's <span class="companylink">Hotel Indigo</span> at 127 W. 28th St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Money has been no object," Mr. Moinian said. "I always had my eyes on it. It's one of the most iconic trophy assets in the eastern United States."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Garden City Hotel</span> opened in 1874 and was the largest and most exclusive hotel on Long Island. Designed by architect Stanford White, the building gained prominence when Charles Lindbergh stayed there before his trans-Atlantic flight to Paris in 1927.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the hotel burned down and was rebuilt. It also was razed in 1974 and rebuilt again. Other guests have included John F. Kennedy, Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rooms were shut during the renovation, but the hotel restaurant and meeting rooms stayed open. Some rooms opened up last week with nightly rates ranging from about $200 to more than $400, depending on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garden City itself, part of the town of Hempstead, was envisioned as a suburban luxury community by millionaire Alexander Turney Stewart in 1869. He established it by buying thousands of acres of land. On them, big houses, boulevards and the <span class="companylink">Garden City Hotel</span> were built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has gone through a several economic ups and downs. Nassau County's overall vacancy rate -- 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013 -- is well above Manhattan's, which was 11.1%, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, the commercial real estate company. But the Nassau rate was 0.6 percentage points lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say they've seen an improvement in recent years. According to the <span class="companylink">Albanese Organization</span>, which began acquiring buildings in Garden City in the late 1990s, some office rents are in the mid-$30s a square foot, about 20% higher than 10 years ago, according to Russell Matthews, an Albanese principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albanese has ownership stakes in eight commercial properties on Franklin Avenue. The company recently signed its tenth lease since last May for a total of 43,725 square feet of office and retail space. Tenants signing office deals include <span class="companylink">First Republic Bank</span> and the law firm Harding Burke &amp; Hogan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip Pilevsky's Philips International spent $18.5 million in late 2012 to purchase two medical office buildings that total 77,620 square feet at 520 Franklin Ave. and 601 Franklin Ave., also evidence of the resurgence. Philips has started to convert the buildings to condominiums to sell units to businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philips also owns two other buildings in Garden City, a residential rental building called Hampshire House that it bought in 2004 and a retail building at 730 Franklin Ave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe Garden City is definitely coming back and it's on its way to being what it once was," said Seth Pilevsky, co-president of Philips International and Mr. Pilevsky's son.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of shedding debt, Americans are taking advantage of easier lending conditions, fueling a rise in borrowing that could prop up a shaky economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumers late last year drove the largest quarterly increase in household credit outstanding since the third quarter of 2007, just before the recession started, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>. Between October and December, household debt—which includes mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and student loans—jumped $241 billion, or 2.1%, to $11.52 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One major factor has been stable mortgage debt, the biggest piece of household borrowing. Mortgage debt increased by $16 billion in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, ending a four-year streak of year-over-year declines. Fewer Americans are filing for bankruptcy or going into foreclosure, moves that lower total mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, people are borrowing more to pay for education, cars and homes. All told, household credit outstanding was up $180 billion in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the first year-over-year increase since late 2008. Household debt remains 9% below its peak of $12.7 trillion in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and the <span class="companylink">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</span> have found banks relaxing their criteria for businesses and consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall inflation remains muted at the start of 2014, but housing inflation is starting to rise. The Labor Department's "owners' equivalent rent index"—the imputed cost to homeowners if they had to pay rent for their own homes—was up a year-on-year 2.5% in January. That's below the 4% rises the OER index posted in early 2007, before the recession hit late that year, but up from an average of around 2% for the past couple of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported Thursday that the consumer-price index of all goods and services increased 1.6% in the year through January. Core CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, also rose 1.6%. The OER index accounts for nearly a quarter of the entire CPI, so a pickup in that category will boost overall inflation.</p>

</div><div class="author">David Reilly </div><div>399 words</div><div>23 February 2014</div><div>08:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will January snow showers give way to May housing flowers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The harsh winter has taken a toll on the housing recovery. Last week showed existing-home sales in January fell 5% from the previous month while housing starts dropped 16%. This week isn't likely to bring a thaw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Case-Shiller/S&amp;P index figures due Tuesday are expected to show home prices rose more than 12% in 2013, the latest reading will reflect activity before the worst weather hit. New-home sales for January, due out Wednesday, are expected to show a third consecutive month of decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending-home sales data, expected Friday, could be even worse. If they disappoint, it would mark the eighth consecutive month of declines. That would be particularly troubling because these are a leading indicator, based on contract signings, as opposed to existing-home sales, which are based on closed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter, though, usually gives way to spring. That could lead to a sharp bounce back, especially if the decline now being seen reflects delayed, rather than scrapped, home-buying activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether that is the case depends on heavier forces than snow—the impact of higher mortgage rates and the depth of employment gains. Talk starting last May that the Federal Reserve would taper its bond purchases led to a swift rise in long-term yields. Pending home sales began showing month-over-month declines in June. Mortgage applications, meanwhile, went into retreat from May onward, having risen from early 2011 until then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The climb in mortgage rates from bargain-basement levels around 3.35% understandably dented activity. Yet today's rates—at an average of about 4.3% for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage—are still historically low. After an adjustment period, buyers are likely to act on this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The degree to which they do so depends on employment. Questions about the strength of the job market abound given the surprisingly fast fall over the past year in the unemployment rate to 6.6% in January—even as payroll gains in December and January were tepid. The worry is that the rate is being driven by declines in labor-force participation and that it doesn't reflect underemployment among many workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For housing to get past the current icy patch, the jobs market will first have to regain its footing.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell in January to their lowest level in 18 months as higher prices and mortgage rates squeezed buyers who continue to face shortages of properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell by 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.62 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday. The median sales price in January stood at $188,900, up 10.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report shows how the housing market is struggling to shift gears, from a marketplace propelled by investors chasing foreclosed properties to one where first-time and trade-up buyers play a larger role now that the supply of distressed properties has dropped sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volumes are being challenged by reduced affordability of homes and severe winter weather in many parts of the country -- two factors putting a damper on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real-estate agents say the market also is being constrained by a lack of supply. There were only 1.9 million homes on the market in January, according to the Realtors' group. While that was a 2.2% increase from December, only three months during the past 12 years have seen inventories at even lower levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the market picks up in the spring depends on whether homeowners like Ravi Parikh, an information-technology consultant in the Chicago area, puts his home on the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Parikh, 51 years old, owns his Hoffman Estates, Ill., home outright, and is looking to trade up to something bigger. But so far he hasn't listed, as he can't find anything good to buy. "I am finding a limited number of houses in [my] price range. If something comes up in that prices range it gets snapped up immediately," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists worry that if inventory levels don't improve, the housing recovery faces a rough road, as the boost from distressed-property investors and ultralow interest rates -- which sparked the rebound over the past two years -- weakens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of inventory is "greatly hindering the buyers' enthusiasm," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. "They're making a major expenditure. They don't want to see two homes -- they want to see 10 homes before buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, sellers' primary concern was selling their home for less than they wanted -- or, in many cases, for less than they owed on their mortgage. Today, homeowners worry they will sell their homes before they can find something that they can afford to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Amy Lass, a 32-year-old lawyer in Carlsbad, Calif. Ms. Lass and her husband bought their current home, a $400,000 townhouse, near the bottom of the market. It is now worth around $525,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lass says she isn't sure she will list her house any time soon. That is because prices in the San Diego area have risen so fast -- and inventory has fallen so low -- she is worried about finding another place to live. Just as the rising price of her home has given her access to a six-figure down payment, four-bedroom homes in her area have risen to around $750,000 to $800,000 -- out of her price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a double-edged sword. I'm going to reap the benefit when I sell, but on the flip side I don't have as much buying power," she said. "It's not like I can sell high and buy low."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect inventory to rise in the spring, as higher prices entice more sellers to list. Rising home prices have also created a new pool of potential sellers who until recently were "underwater" -- owning homes worth less than their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the inventory problem can be "self-perpetuating, sooner or later, when there's not enough inventory, prices rise and that draws people to sell," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gabby Warshawer  </div><div>1173 words</div><div>22 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past several years SoHo's residential real-estate market has been among the most expensive in New York City, a trend that is expected to continue given the extremely limited amount of new development in the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the former manufacturing hub was colonized by artists who lived and worked in its lofts in the 1970s, the spaces became coveted residential real estate in subsequent decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the historic-preservation movement in SoHo, which happened in tandem with its revival as a residential area, sought to protect its many cast-iron buildings in the face of a Robert Moses plan to construct two elevated highways in the neighborhood. Most of SoHo was given landmark designation in 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has also become more of a tourist destination over the past couple of decades, and shoppers flock to Broadway's stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While record sales prices were reached in other Manhattan neighborhoods, median real-estate prices for SoHo residential properties were the second highest in the city last year, trailing only neighboring TriBeCa, according to data compiled by the real-estate website StreetEasy.com. The overall median sales price in SoHo was $2.5 million in 2013, compared with $2.6 million in TriBeCa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For new developments, StreetEasy said the median price in SoHo last year was $3.9 million compared with $2.9 million paid in TriBeCa. There were only 23 new condo sales during the year in SoHo, compared with TriBeCa's 127.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since most of SoHo falls within a historic district, there are significant constraints on new construction, which contributes to a smaller pool of real-estate inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're looking at a very unique housing stock in SoHo that is very difficult to get anywhere else," says StreetEasy's Alan Lightfeldt. "The full-floor lofts are extremely limited in supply and highly desirable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are only a few new condominiums currently under construction in the neighborhood, including One Vandam, a 25-unit limestone-and-glass building that is being constructed on Sixth Avenue and Spring Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's developer said the limited number and exclusive nature of new developments in SoHo help to account for the higher price tags in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the new projects are of a boutique scale, which allows a developer to take more design risks, adding to the special quality of the buildings there," said Timothy Quinlan, a principal at New York-based <span class="companylink">Quinlan Development Group</span>, which is developing One Vandam in partnership with Tavros Development Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Units in One Vandam are priced around $3,000 a foot, and the most expensive penthouse, a triplex, has an asking price of $28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the building is only expected to begin rising out of the ground in the coming days, more than 40% of the units are now in contract, according to Mr. Quinlan, who said One Vandam is on pace to be completed in the early spring of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents and real-estate brokers say that the area continues to grow as an international destination both for apartment buyers and tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A business improvement district covering Broadway from Houston to Canal streets was approved in October after being in the planning stages for five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major impetus for the district's creation was the high volume of tourist and shopper foot traffic on the thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's about managing the success of Broadway because the retailers and tourists result in such large crowds," said Barbara Cohen, a consultant to the district's formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cohen said the district is intended to supplement city services such as sanitation that are strained by Broadway's high volume of pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: Park space isn't in abundance in SoHo. Vesuvio Playground, on Thompson and Spring streets, has basketball and handball courts, as well as a small pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: There are no public schools in the neighborhood because the zoning for manufacturing uses doesn't allow them. Schools in nearby districts serving the area include P.S. 130 in Little Italy, an elementary school that received an A grade from the city on its most recent progress report. Elisabeth Irwin High School, on Charlton Street, is the upper school for the West Village's Little Red School House, an independent school founded in the early 1920s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dining: SoHo's array of dining options runs the gamut from cheap and casual to trendy and pricey. Balthazar Restaurant, a tourist favorite, serves French bistro staples such as steak frites and duck confit. Isola Trattoria &amp; Crudo Bar, located in the Mondrian SoHo Hotel, specializes in the cuisine of the Amalfi Coast with entrees that include monkfish and fettuccine with lobster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: The many contemporary art galleries in SoHo include Opera Gallery on Spring Street and AFA on Greene Street. The Angelika Film Center on West Houston Street screens independent films.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: There is no want for shopping options in the neighborhood, which is home to the many clothing retailers lining Broadway -- among them Victoria's Secret, Old Navy, Uniqlo and Bloomingdale's -- as well as smaller designer boutiques on side streets, such as 3.1 Phillip Lim and Marc Jacobs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell in January to their lowest level in 18 months as higher prices and mortgage rates squeezed buyers who continue to face shortages of properties for sale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes also remains near its lowest level in 50 years. Builders completed fewer than 570,000 new single-family homes last year, down from an average of 1.1 million from 1990 through 2003.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most housing markets in the country are experiencing low inventory, but there are some exceptions. Several markets that witnessed the biggest price rebounds over the past year, including Atlanta, Phoenix, Miami, Sacramento, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., saw inventories post double-digit increases at the end of 2013 from a year earlier, according to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly survey of market conditions in 28 major metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in places where inventories are increasing, "the level is still much lower than it was two, three four year ago," says Svenja Gudell, director of economic research at <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., the real-estate information company. "It's hard to sell homes when you don't have any to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report Thursday from Zillow showed that national home values increased 0.2% in January from a month earlier, the smallest rise since May 2012.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A broad measure of home sales fell sharply in January, the latest sign the housing market is buckling under higher mortgage rates, tight inventory and severely cold weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 5.1% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.62 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was steeper than economists' expectations and raises new questions about the underlying strength of the housing market. Sales began slowing in the middle of last year, long before chilly winter and snowstorms gripped much of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which reflect more than 90% of all home purchases, fell across all four regions in January, but the biggest drop occurred in the West, which has been the warmest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January existing home sales left much to be desired, but don't blame it on the weather," said Bill Banfield, vice president of mortgage lender Quicken Loans. "Low home inventories in various parts of the country don't give buyers as many options as they would like right now, causing some to wait until their dream home comes along."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said other factors, along with the cold, are at play, including higher mortgage rates and prices, a shortage of properties for sale, and tight lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some places, such as the West, a run-up in prices has prompted many prospective buyers to step back and rethink buying, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventory is also crimping sales, particularly among lower-priced properties, he said. "The lack of supply I believe is greatly hindering the buyers' enthusiasm," Mr. Yun said. "They're making a major expenditure. They don't want to see two homes—they want to see 10 homes before buying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economists said they believe fundamentals of the housing market remain strong and that sales will pick up as the weather warms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report showed existing-home sales were down 5.1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of existing homes in January was $188,900, up 10.7% from a year earlier. Inventory remains tight by historical standards but is growing. At the January sales pace, it would take 4.9 months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market, up from 4.6 months in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage edged up this week to 4.33%, nearly a percentage point higher from May, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are projected to rise further as the Federal Reserve moves to unwind its bond-buying program by year-end. The Fed in recent months has moved to cut its monthly bond purchases to $65 billion from $85 billion. Officials have signaled they would make further cuts in coming months if the economy improves as they expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data suggest the housing market has cooled. Home-builder confidence fell sharply this month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> reported this week. Housing starts—a measure of new construction—fell by 16% in January from December, the Commerce Department reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales dropped in December to the lowest level since the summer, according to an earlier Commerce Department report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks closed higher Friday, receiving a lift from the news Ukraine's political forces have reached a preliminary agreement to put an end to the political crisis that has been rocking the country in recent days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leaders signed a deal aimed at ending the deadly political crisis in the country by reducing the president's powers, forming a new coalition government and calling early presidential elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed the session 0.4% higher. France's CAC 40 was the best performer over the major indexes in Europe rising by 0.6%, while Germany's DAX and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 both closed 0.4% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. markets were also higher on the day in recent trading, shrugging off data showing that home sales fell sharply in January, the latest sign the property market is buckling under higher mortgage rates and a severe winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell by 5.1% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.62 million, according to data by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. It is the lowest level in 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500's was up by 0.3% as European markets closed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also gaining 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks have been rising over the past couple of weeks, as investors increasingly believe any recent slowing in economic growth is weather-related and therefore temporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Weather-related volatility is likely to keep existing home sales below trend for the next few months, but we do not see this effect as persisting indefinitely. Accordingly, we anticipate that existing home sales are likely to recover in the first half of 2014," said <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Michael Gapen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the weak U.S. data resulted in the euro climbing to a day's high of $1.3759, from around the $1.3720 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, China's yuan slumped for its sixth day setting its biggest weekly loss against the dollar in over three years on speculation the central bank is seeking to cool gains in the currency and cut down on heavy inflows from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, gold prices declined Friday, falling 0.2% to $1,323.10 an ounce, while Brent crude dropped 0.7% to $109.54 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, shares in France's <span class="companylink">Valeo SA</span> surged after the car-parts maker declared a 13% higher dividend and forecast faster sales growth driven by strong demand outside Europe for its automotive components and systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bullish outlook from <span class="companylink">Valeo</span> reflects its success in diversifying its business away from Europe, where demand for new cars is recovering slowly from a six-year slump, toward Asia, and China in particular, where demand for new vehicles, particularly in premium categories, continues to surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the attention will turn Saturday to the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> industrial and developing nations in Australia. The world's largest developing nations, including Brazil and India, are expected to urge the Federal Reserve to reconsider how quickly it winds down its bond-buying program.</p>

</div><div class="author">Chun Han Wong  </div><div>640 words</div><div>21 February 2014</div><div>02:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINGAPORE—Singapore plans to keep property-market cooling measures in place for the time being, its finance minister said Friday, even as real-estate prices show signs of stabilizing after large increases in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government, meanwhile, plans to increase social spending to help elderly Singaporeans cope with health-care and living costs, as well as extend efforts to boost efficiency in local companies, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam told Parliament in his annual budget speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These measures are part of a long-term plan to improve economic productivity and cut dependence on foreign workers, whom many citizens blame for overcrowding, soaring home prices and depressed low-end pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the run-up in prices in the last four years, it is too early to start relaxing our measures," Mr. Tharman said. "The government will continue to monitor the property market in the coming quarters and adjust our measures when necessary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His comments came after government data last month showed private-home prices fell 0.9% in the fourth quarter from the third, snapping six straight quarters of growth, as government interventions crimped real-estate investment. Property analysts say prices could fall further this year as large supplies of new homes reach the market amid a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Singapore has imposed a series of property-market curbs since September 2009 to combat upward price pressures from low interest rates and abundant capital inflows. The latest measures-tighter property-loan rules introduced in June-have hurt demand, though prices are still up 61% since the end of June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a wide-ranging speech, Mr. Tharman said the government expects to spend more than S$9 billion on health-care and other benefits to about 450,000 elderly citizens currently aged 65 and older. This would be funded by money from a new S$8 billion fund, which about half would be spent over the next decade, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More money will be spent to help businesses become more efficient and support their overseas expansion, while employers will be required to contribute more to workers' health-care pensions, the minister said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government will also take steps to curb the construction sector's reliance on low-skilled migrant labor, imposing higher levies on the industry's hiring of "basic-skilled" foreigners from July 2016, Mr. Tharman said, adding that foreign-workforce growth is expected to keep slowing over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Singaporean businesses likely heaved a sigh of relief that there was no further tightening of the foreign manpower policies for now, with the exception of the construction sector," <span class="companylink">Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp</span>., Singapore's second-largest lender by assets, said in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In tax changes announced Friday, the government increased duties on tobacco and alcohol effective Friday, while higher levies in lottery betting will kick in from July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fiscal year starting April 1, the government expects to post an overall deficit of S$1.16 billion-its first budget deficit since fiscal year 2009. Even so, this deficit won't be funded using past reserves as Singapore has accumulated sufficient surpluses in recent years, Mr. Tharman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expenditure for the coming fiscal year is estimated at S$56.66 billion, with another S$3.61 billion to be spent on social, economic and wage-supplement programs, compared with an operating revenue of S$59.51 billion, according to a government statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the current fiscal year, Singapore expects a budget surplus of S$3.92 billion, compared with the S$2.4 billion originally estimated, due to lower-than-expected public-infrastructure spending and higher revenues from vehicle levies, among other factors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Can we stop talking about the weather?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That cry from Federated Investors analysts in their weekly email to clients Tuesday echoed the feeling of many weary traders and investors over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the brutal freeze affecting much of the U.S. presents more than just fodder for idle small talk in financial markets these days. It also presents an unexpected conundrum for many investors: Will the subzero wind chills and snowstorms have a lasting effect on the economy? And if so, which stocks should investors buy and sell?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amount of conversations with clients about this weather theme has reached a fever pitch," said Joseph Spinelli, who heads cash equity trading for the Americas at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s New York office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spinelli has been in regular contact with the bank's own energy analysts -- who are plugged into the weather because of its impact on commodity prices -- for insights into historical weather patterns and their impact on certain sectors. "It's the topic du jour," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather has been blamed for two weak jobs reports in a row as well as poor retail sales, construction and manufacturing data. With plenty of winter left, the weather could be a factor to contend with for weeks, or even months, before any distortions are reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, many investors take the view that those weak economic trends will reverse when the thaw comes. But for others, the cold snap has been a reason to change gears in portfolios that had been betting on stronger economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huntington Asset Advisors Inc. has been cutting back exposure to subsectors like auto makers, glass makers and home builders because of the weather, said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer. Huntington has been selling shares of those stocks or hedging against declines with options strategies, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The weather is going to affect auto sales, retail sales, employment . . . it's certainly going to affect the housing area," said Mr. Bateman, whose firm manages $14.5 billion in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of the bad weather has been the kind of blizzard seen only on Wall Street: research reports. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> this week published a report titled, "Winter's Worst Puts Pessimists in Full Bloom." <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> currency strategists joined in on Tuesday, saying the U.S. dollar outlook "remains clouded by weather."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s economic group last week tried to estimate what economic growth would look like were it not for the bad weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The geographic and intramonth granularity in our primary datasets suggest a meaningful drag from weather in many key economic series," they wrote. The firm's "counterfactual" estimates included pending home sales rising 7.8% in January instead of 0.2% and retail sales gaining 0.5% excluding gasoline and auto sales, instead of declining 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather has loomed large for investors because many started 2014 with high economic expectations. Many tilted their portfolios toward stocks that stood to benefit from a continued upswing in growth. Fed officials, too, expressed optimism on the economy as they have started to cut stimulus efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means a lot rides on whether the weather really is behind the U.S. economy's chill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Stein, co-director of the $13 billion global income group at <span class="companylink">Eaton Vance Corp</span>., said for now, he and his team in Boston are treating the weather as "noise." He said some of the obsession with the weather stems simply from the financial-services sector's being concentrated in hard-hit areas like New York and other parts of the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To some extent, the people who are in the financial business kind of overextrapolate what's happening to them to everyone else," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Marshall, portfolio manager with the $1.8 billion Hodges Funds, decided to try and take advantage of that noise. He bought shares of cement and concrete maker <span class="companylink">Eagle Materials Inc</span>. as shares slid after the company said quarterly earnings and sales missed analysts' forecasts.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka  </div><div>639 words</div><div>21 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy is down, many homeowners look for places to scrimp and save. Home maintenance isn't one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than cut back, homeowners increase the amount they spend on routine repairs and maintenance, such as painting, during poor housing cycles, says Tammy Leonard, clinical assistant professor of economics at the <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Dallas</span>, who studied maintenance expenditures of households between 2001 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2007 and 2009, after the housing bubble burst in 2006, homeowners upped their maintenance spending by an annual average of 63%, or $423 for the average household, compared with an 18% annual average increase in the period between 2001 and 2007 when house prices were rising. When combining all sample years, the average household spent $671, adjusted to year-2000 dollars, annually on maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners may have decided to spend more to maintain their homes because they expected to stay there longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their expectations in the tenure of their house may have changed," Prof. Leonard says. "No one wanted to sell in 2007, and people have thought they would invest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study's findings applied to all housing groups except for one -- households with low home equity and low income. That pool of homeowners likely faced a high risk of default and slashed their maintenance costs to nil when the market turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Leonard examined roughly 10,000 to 12,000 single-family homes, based on data from the American Housing Survey administered by the U.S. Census. Households reported their maintenance costs as well as the estimated value of their home, which determined their loan-to-value ratio as well as their perceived default risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, "The Impact of Housing Market Conditions on Residential Property Upkeep," was published in Housing Studies in January 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madeleine Romanello, broker associate with One <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Miami Beach, Fla., says homeowners may increase their spending in poor housing cycles to help their property sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[Good maintenance] is a major, major factor in selling a listing," Ms. Romanello says. "The house has to look completely pristine. Every light bulb needs to be working; the house has to be totally clean."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers believe cosmetic issues indicate larger functional or structural problems. "The minute buyers see any sort of neglect that's visible, they think there are more underlying problems with the property," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the buyer's mind, one little thing can trigger a negative feeling about the whole area," says Linda Olson, an agent with Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate David Winans &amp; Associates in Arlington, Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four weeks ago, Ms. Olson got a $182,000 listing for a two-story, well-maintained home in Mansfield, Texas. Within a week, five agents had criticized the neighborhood. One agent mentioned a nearby house, which had overgrown grass, chipped paint and an old truck in the driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Olson promptly knocked on the neighbor's door. "I said, we were really trying to sell the house, and it would help me out a lot if you could cut the grass and rake the leaves and move your truck," she says. Fortunately, the neighbor obliged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm negotiating an offer right now," Ms. Olson adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fit and Finish</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices generally rose from 2001 to 2007 and fell from 2007 to 2009. During the latter period, homeowners increased the amount they spent on maintaining their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Percentage by which households increased annual maintenance costs, on average:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- 18%, or $120, 2001 to 2007</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- 63%, or $423, 2007 to 2009</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mortgage Troubles Near Prerecession Levels; Improvement Could Lessen Any Slowdown in Housing Market</span>
</div><div class="author">Conor Dougherty </div><div>778 words</div><div>20 February 2014</div><div>12:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years after the end of the U.S. recession, the number of Americans who are behind on their mortgages and the backlog of homes in the foreclosure process are finally narrowing to prerecession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. mortgage delinquency rate—loans that are a payment or more behind but not yet in foreclosure—fell to 6.39% of loans in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from 7.09% a year ago and the lowest rate since the early months of recession in the first quarter of 2008, according to a report Thursday by the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlog of foreclosure inventory also fell to its lowest level since 2008, while the number of loans on which lenders initiated foreclosure was the lowest since 2006, which was when the housing bubble was starting to burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on foreclosures and delinquencies comes as news in the housing-sales market points to a cooling after a sharp run-up in sales and prices during 2013. In the fourth quarter, a combination of rising prices and higher interest rates eroded housing affordability and pushed many buyers to the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the decline in troubled loans means that even if the cooling trend continues or intensifies, there is less danger of the market getting clobbered by a massive foreclosure wave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another encouraging sign: Three-quarters of the nation's troubled loans were made in 2007 or earlier, and delinquency rates for loans made after that point are around historical norms, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. "The legacy of very high foreclosure rates is a problem of older loans," said Michael Fratantoni, the MBA's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures are down partly because the economy and unemployment rate have improved. Also, banks have reined in many of the looser lending practices that allowed many borrowers to get in over their head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boost in home prices, which began about two years ago in many parts of the country, also helped. Overall prices in December were 8.4% higher than one year earlier, according to Black Knight Financial Services, formerly LPS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This rise has rescued many of the "underwater" borrowers whose home values fell so far during the recession that they owed more on their mortgage than the home was worth. In October, 11.4% of loans were "underwater," according to Black Knight, down from about 19% at the start of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement in foreclosures has been uneven. Just as some regions have boomed and others have lagged behind in the economic recovery, so has it been with the hangover of foreclosures left on the market. The strength of regional economies, state-to-state foreclosure processes and varying responses to the housing bust have led to different rates of healing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western markets like California and Arizona were among the hardest hit by the real-estate bust, but now have foreclosure inventories that rank among the bottom handful of states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Brentwood, Calif., a suburb on the edge of the San Francisco Bay Area. At the nadir of the housing bust in 2009, a majority of homes for sale in the area involved foreclosures, said Casey McCann, Brentwood's community development director. "The entire city was affected," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, like many U.S. cities, investors descended on Brentwood to buy homes for cash that they rented out or flipped to new owners. Mr. McCann says today the share of foreclosures for sale is around 17%. Some 1.25% of California mortgages were in foreclosure at the end of 2013, well below the national average, according to the MBA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states are further along than others in reducing the backlog of foreclosures. Most of the nation's highest foreclosure inventory rates are in the "judicial states," where banks must get court approval to foreclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida, a judicial state, had the nation's highest share of loans in foreclosure, 8.56%. Still, that was down to a bit more than half of its peak rate. New Jersey and New York—also judicial states—were next on the list and were the only other states with foreclosure inventory rates above 6%. The MBA said that 15 of the 17 states where the foreclosure inventory was higher than the national average were judicial states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judicial review has stretched out the foreclosure process, in part because banks have struggled to provide the proper paperwork to demonstrate ownership of mortgages. That has given homeowners more time to work out their debts. But some economists say it has hindered housing markets by slowing the repossession of abandoned or blighted properties.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Carney has been governor of the Bank of England for fewer than eight months and he has already sacrificed his push for "forward guidance" -- an attempt to make monetary policy more transparent and predictable -- on the altar of easy money. Last August, he and the British central bank's Monetary Policy Committee targeted 7% unemployment as the point at which they would start to raise interest rates. The jobless rate has since fallen more quickly than expected and is now set to pass that mark in March. Instead of sticking to the plan, the BOE last week decided to keep interest rates near zero at least through 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year's caveats leaving the door open for early rate rises have given way to vague conditions that must be met before they could conceivably rise. For instance, Mr. Carney reassured markets and businesses that the money faucets will stay open until there is a "business recovery." This allowed him to claim that forward guidance is not dead but merely going into "phase two."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that sounds like a bad Monty Python script, to be fair Mr. Carney's capitulation follows a similar flip-flop at the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed set a 7% unemployment rate as its forward-guidance target for ending bond buying and 6.5% as the trigger for raising rates. The American jobless rate is now 6.6% and the bond buying continues at $65 billion per month, tapered from $85 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way the markets fell out of bed last May and June, when former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke mooted the taper, was enough to spook the Fed. That evidently convinced him that the U.S. economy needed more time under his free-money treatment to regain full health. If trillions of dollars in stock-market value were wiped out in a selloff, he feared the reverse wealth effect could harm the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney came to the same conclusion, despite the BOE's projection of 3.4% GDP growth this year. The U.K. housing market is recovering, and in London there are already fears of a new bubble, with real estate prices rising at a 10% annual clip. So while consumer prices remain stable -- 1.9% at an annual rate in January and there's no sign of deflation -- asset prices are signaling potential trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's consistent with how easy money can flow through the economy. In the early and mid-2000s, it flowed into housing and commodities. In the current round it is going into property and stocks; the FTSE 100 and S&amp;P 500 indices rose 14% and 30% last year respectively. In the search for yield, investors also move into more speculative plays. The longer the cost of capital remains artificially low on both sides of the Atlantic, the greater the risk of malinvestment and new debt workouts once the liquidity is withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lesson to be drawn from the failure of forward guidance is that policy makers invest too much faith in the power of monetary policy to revive economies. Loose money may be indispensable during and right after a panic to offset the collapse in the velocity of money (how often it changes hands) and restore market stability. But central banks can be left pushing on a string if governments don't undertake reforms to spur new business investment and hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be obvious but seems to require saying: Forward guidance can only reduce market uncertainty if central bankers set targets and stick to them. Their ultimate goal should be price stability, not a particular level of employment. Underwriting stock and real estate prices is even dicier given the difficulty of knowing when to stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's past time the BOE and Federal Reserve returned monetary policy to normality. The onus for making reforms to revive economies belongs on elected politicians.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Construction of new homes tumbled in January, the latest sign of cooling in the housing market as much of the U.S. shivered through a cold and snowy winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts fell 16% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 880,000, the lowest level since September, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was down from an upwardly revised December rate of 1.05 million new homes built, marking the largest month-over-month decline since February 2011. Starts on single-family homes sank 15.9% in January to an annual pace of 573,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 5.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 937,000 last month from December's upwardly revised rate of 991,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected smaller declines in both measures, predicting housing starts would fall 4.9% to 950,000 and building permits would fall 1.1% to 980,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter weather likely dragged down the housing sector in January after strong growth throughout most of 2013. Many economists already have blamed cold and snow in the eastern U.S. for a weaker-than-expected performance by retailers and factories this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In short, this data tells us nothing about the underlying state of the housing market," Stephen Stanley, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the figures suggest more than just the weather may be at work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of housing starts last month actually rose in the chilly Northeast by 61.9%. But it fell 67.7% in the Midwest to the lowest pace on record. Starts also fell 12.5% in the South and 17.4% in the West, which has experienced relatively warm weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we believe the weather did impact construction activity, we think this is just part of the story, as the new construction slowdown was more broad-based," <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Yelena Shulyatyeva wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits were still up 2.4% in January from a year earlier, though housing starts last month were down 2% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report prompted several economists to lower their predictions for first-quarter economic growth. <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span> cut its forecast by a tenth of a percentage point to an annualized 1.7%. <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> lowered its forecast by 0.3 percentage point to an annual rate of 1.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As winter weather abates, "we expect that some of the softness in private residential construction will be reversed in the coming months, most likely in the second quarter," <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> senior U.S. economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's recovery showed signs of cooling in the second half of 2013 as prices rose and the Federal Reserve began pulling back its bond-buying program, which is aimed at lowering borrowing costs. A 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage had an average interest rate of 4.43% in January, up from last May's average of 3.54%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., one of the largest U.S. home builders, budgeted $2 billion for spending on land this year, up from $1.3 billion in 2013. "Our decision to increase investment into the business is consistent with our view that U.S. housing continues to advance to a sustained multiyear recovery," Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Dugas said on a Jan. 30 earnings call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home-builder confidence took a hit in February, falling to its lowest level since May, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> survey released Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span> . said Wednesday it plans to hire about 25,000 seasonal employees at its U.S. stores during its spring busy season, down from 45,000 workers last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lowe's</span>  and peer <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>  have been rare bright spots in the retail sector as they continue to benefit from the U.S. housing recovery.

</div><div class="author">Alexandra Scaggs </div><div>899 words</div><div>19 February 2014</div><div>13:51</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Can we stop talking about the weather?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plaintive cry from Federated Investors analysts in their weekly email to clients Tuesday echoed the feeling of many weary traders and investors over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the brutal freeze affecting much of the U.S. presents more than just fodder for idle small talk in financial markets these days. It also presents an unexpected conundrum for many investors: Will the subzero wind chills and snowstorms have a lasting effect on the economy? And if so, which stocks should investors buy and sell?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amount of conversations with clients about this weather theme has reached a fever pitch," said Joseph Spinelli, who heads cash equity trading for the Americas at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s New York office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Spinelli, that has meant being in regular contact with the bank's own energy analysts—who are plugged into the weather because of its impact on commodity prices—for insights into historical weather patterns and their impact on certain sectors. "It's the topic du jour," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather has been blamed for two weak jobs reports in a row as well as poor retail sales, construction and manufacturing data. With plenty of winter left, the weather could be a factor to contend with for weeks, or even months, before any distortions are reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, many investors take the view that those weak economic trends will reverse when the thaw comes. But for others, the cold snap has been a reason to change gears in portfolios that had been betting on stronger economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huntington Asset Advisors Inc. has been cutting back exposure to subsectors like auto makers, glass manufacturers and home builders because of the weather, said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer. Huntington has been selling shares of those stocks or hedging against declines with options strategies, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The weather is going to affect auto sales, retail sales, employment…it's certainly going to affect the housing area," said Mr. Bateman, whose firm manages $14.5 billion in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of the bad weather has been the kind of blizzard seen only on Wall Street: research reports. <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> this week published a report titled, "Winter's Worst Puts Pessimists in Full Bloom." <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> currency strategists joined in on Tuesday, saying the U.S. dollar outlook "remains clouded by weather."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s economic group, meanwhile, last week attempted to estimate what economic growth would look like were it not for the bad weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The geographic and intramonth granularity in our primary datasets suggest a meaningful drag from weather in many key economic series," they wrote. The firm's "counterfactual" estimates included pending home sales rising 7.8% in January instead of 0.2% and retail sales gaining 0.5% excluding gasoline and auto sales, instead of declining 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather has loomed large for investors because many started 2014 with high expectations for the economy. Many tilted their portfolios toward stocks that stood to benefit from a continued upswing in growth. Fed officials, too, expressed optimism about the economy as they have started to pare back their stimulus efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means a lot rides on whether the weather really is behind the U.S. economy's chill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Stein, co-director of the $13 billion global income group at <span class="companylink">Eaton Vance Corp</span>., said for now, he and his team in Boston are treating the weather as "noise." He said some of the obsession with the weather stems simply from the financial-services sector's being concentrated in hard-hit areas like New York and other parts of the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To some extent, the people who are in the financial business kind of overextrapolate what's happening to them to everyone else," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Marshall, portfolio manager with the $1.8 billion Hodges Funds, decided to try and take advantage of that noise. He bought shares of cement and concrete maker <span class="companylink">Eagle Materials Inc</span>. as the shares slid after the company reported that fourth-quarter earnings and sales fell short of analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marshall said the cold weather likely weighed on demand for building materials such as cement and he expects sales to rebound in the spring. "Weather…is temporary in nature [and] usually creates a good buying opportunity," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for some traders in the energy markets, where prices routinely rise and fall based on expectations for winter heating demand, the weather-driven swings have been wearing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natural-gas futures have not only surged this winter, they have also been highly volatile. So far this year, they have moved at least 5% during 13 trading sessions. They shot to a more than five-year high of $6.149 per million British thermal units Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaya Bajpai, executive director of Applied Energy Analytics LLC, a Boston money-management and energy consulting firm, often places bets on the short-term direction of natural-gas prices. But the huge and erratic price swings have led him to back off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many ways for me to give myself heartburn, and trading a commodity that is going up and down 10% every day based solely on the latest weather model is not my preferred way of generating heartburn," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Nearly a year after Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty scolded the country's biggest banks for fueling record-high housing prices by cutting mortgage rates, his campaign to prevent a bubble is gaining traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada's fragile economy means the <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span> can't safely raise interest rates, depriving policy makers of a traditional tool to keep the market from overheating. Instead, they have used a combination of tighter lending rules and verbal warnings, including the unusual rebuke of the banks in March 2013, to try to keep prices in check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it isn't clear whether those moves have been enough, many credit Mr. Flaherty for taking some of the froth out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reality on the ground is that the government has definitely achieved a soft landing in housing," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Toronto money manager <span class="companylink">Gluskin Sheff + Associates Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many observers, including prominent economists such as Nouriel Roubini, think the market is still drastically overvalued and vulnerable to a sharp correction. The ultimate outcome of Mr. Flaherty's bid to rein in prices without raising interest rates could be an important test of the ability of policy makers in Canada and elsewhere to avoid a repeat of the housing bust that contributed to the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian housing market's expansion over the past dozen years has led to bloated personal debt and a construction industry that accounts for almost twice as big a percentage of Canada's gross domestic product as the sector does in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian home prices have doubled since 2002 to an average of 388,553 Canadian dollars (US$353,873) in January, rising steadily except for a brief pause during the recession. Current prices are roughly 50% above those in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing the risks of Canada's housing market, some global investors have trimmed their exposure to Canada's banking industry or taken short positions in the sector to protect themselves against any correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next few months may bring more clarity about the market's condition as data become available on the sales and prices in the spring, the crucial season in Canada's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, house prices have risen strongly in several other developed countries—including Sweden, Norway, Australia and New Zealand—in part because easy money makes mortgages cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Australia, home prices in major cities have soared as the central bank has sought to keep rates low to cushion the economy from the end of a long mining boom. New Zealand's central bank tightened lending rules last fall after it said a hot housing market was the biggest threat to the country's financial stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Canada's central bank</span> has kept rates low to help nurture an economy struggling with sluggish exports and sputtering business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> tightened mortgage rules four times in four years, the last time in July 2012. That last round had an initial impact of slowing the pace of sales and price increases in late 2012 and early 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2008 to 2012, Mr. Flaherty implemented several changes, including reducing the maximum amortization period for a government-insured mortgage to 25 from 40 years, and lowering the upper limit that Canadians can borrow against their home equity to 80%. The changes helped generate a respite in housing activity as some buyers were forced to wait on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Mr. Flaherty took the extraordinary step last year of publicly rebuking Canada's major banks for cutting fixed mortgage rates to near-record lows, a move that drew the ire of at least one bank chief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since last summer, prices have roared back and Mr. Flaherty hasn't ruled out further action. Average home prices in Canada rose 9.5% in January from the same month in 2013, according to the country's real-estate trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> said in December that Canada's housing market was 60% overvalued after ranking several countries' markets according to an average of two ratios: house prices to rent and house prices to income. Belgium and New Zealand weren't far behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not everyone believes the housing market's climb means it is at a dangerous point. Canadian banks tend to see a modest domestic overvaluation, with <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> putting it at about 7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz recently told lawmakers he didn't see a bubble. But he also has echoed his predecessor, the current Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, stating there was a risk that housing prices could continue to climb sharply and "set the stage for a sharp correction down the road."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central banker is in a difficult position as he confronts household debt and the housing market. With Canada's economy growing at a lackluster pace, the central bank recently dropped a long-standing bias toward higher rates and shifted to a neutral position on monetary policy. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Canada</span>'s benchmark rate has stood at 1% for more than three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenberg—the former Merrill Lynch chief economist who became known for forecasting the U.S. housing collapse—said that while housing prices remain high, Canada's six-month supply of housing based on current sales suggests that prices will remain stable. Canadian builders have curbed production more quickly than U.S. builders did before the bust there; some markets, such as luxury condos in Toronto and Vancouver, are more vulnerable to steeper corrections, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property developers, particularly those in robust markets such as resource-rich Alberta, remain positive about the market, but say they are aware of the possible effects of high prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Bryce, vice president of sales at the Carlisle Group, a Calgary condo developer, said demand for new housing projects remains strong in Alberta, a direct result of the province's booming oil and gas industry. But he notes that some buyers are being priced out of the market, and as a result Carlisle has focused on small, more-affordable projects. "From a construction standpoint, we're looking good," Mr. Bryce said. "We think a minimum price increase between 6% to 8% is very realistic this year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the tighter mortgage rules may have discouraged some buyers, many continue to be enticed by low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lauren Posen, a Toronto-based recruiter at a software company, is looking for her first home, eyeing a condominium in the downtown core of Canada's largest city. Ms. Posen says she isn't that worried about a crash, nor does she feel much pressure to get into the market before mortgage rates climb higher. Instead, she is taking her time, looking to find a condo that suits her needs—a one-bedroom unit within walking distance of her downtown office and close to a subway line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't get much for C$500,000 in downtown Toronto anymore," she said. The average cost of a condo in the downtown Toronto core in the fourth quarter last year was C$440,966, up 7.5% from the same period in 2012, according to the city's real-estate board.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. house price growth continues to accelerate with official data from the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> showing the sharpest annual gain in over three years in Dec. 2013. The regional breakdown points to London as the main driver.

</div><div class="author">Richard Barley </div><div>512 words</div><div>17 February 2014</div><div>02:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a fine line to walk. Central banks in many developed economies are holding rates near zero to protect fragile economies. But they are also rightly wary about the potential for those low rates to stoke new distortions, such as housing bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent answer to this challenge is so-called macroprudential policy, seen as a targeted way to intervene to rein in imbalances such as excessive lending via regulatory measures. The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> has made clear that this, rather than the blunt tool of a rate increase, is the preferred option in dealing with excesses in a revitalized housing market; the <span class="companylink">Swiss National Bank</span> is already trying out tweaking capital requirements to manage the risks in its real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But will it work? The BOE points to examples such as changes to risk weightings for commercial real estate in India in 2005-2006, or to car loans in Brazil in 2010, where there was a large reduction in lending. That suggests that very targeted measures can work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while macroprudential policy might slow lending growth, it may not have the same clout as an interest-rate hike in changing borrowers' behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden, the Financial Supervisory Authority noted in December that despite higher capital requirements for banks, lending has continued to grow, while the impact on lending rates had been small; Swedish household debt stands at above 170% of disposable income. The Riksbank says knowledge about the effectiveness of macroprudential policy is still limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Switzerland, the SNB has had to launch a second round of increases to the capital required to be held against mortgages. So far, the effect of macroprudential policy there appears limited. <span class="companylink">UBS</span>'s Swiss Real Estate Bubble Index continued to climb into the "risk" category in the fourth quarter; house prices are growing faster than income and mortgage debt is now around 110% of gross domestic product. Swiss fixed-interest mortgage rates have risen only 0.08-0.09 percentage point, notes Nomura. Talks are now under way on further measures that may include tightening lending criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk is that consumers may only respond to something that puts clear limits on what they can borrow, such as caps on loan-to-value ratios, or debt-service ratios. These would undoubtedly be powerful, but could also be controversial. The BOE has said it thinks there needs to be a broad public debate about LTV restrictions for them to be acceptable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key issue here may well be one of signaling. An announcement that a central bank is requiring banks to raise their countercyclical capital buffers, or that it is changing sectoral capital requirements, is clearly going to be more difficult to explain than a rise in a country's interest rate. And it will take a lot to drown out the signal that rates at historical lows send to housing markets and home buyers. The tightrope central banks are trying to walk may be a perilous one.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.K. House Prices Rise Again in February; February's Monthly Increase was Strongest Since October 2012, Says Rightmove</span>
</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington  </div><div>699 words</div><div>16 February 2014</div><div>22:24</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. house prices accelerated further in February, a survey showed Monday, as demand continues to outpace supply, a trend that looks set to continue for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the government's 'Help to Buy' program opened for business in April 2013, the U.K.'s housing market has surged. Not only have prices gained upward momentum, but house sales and mortgage approvals have also increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That run of price gains extended into February, according to online estate agency Rightmove, which said the average asking price of £251,964 ($420,629) in February was 3.3% or £8,103 higher than in January. The monthly increase was the strongest since October 2012, while on the year prices increased 6.9% from February 2013, the sharpest gain since November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January average asking prices rose 1.0% on the month and by 6.3% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market rebound continues," said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's director and housing market analyst. "New sellers are now asking over £16,000 more than those who came to market a year ago, a rate of increase not seen since before the credit-crunch took hold in 2008."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The further increase in asking prices comes despite an 18% increase in the number of homes advertised for sale on the Rightmove website. That highlights the strength of demand for homes, something that has been fueled by accelerating demand from the 'Help to Buy' program which now provides mortgage guarantees to first-time buyers of newly built homes, all-buyers of existing stock up to the price of £600,000 and is now available to Islamic buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, data shows that average house prices rose more than £10,000 between April 2013 and January this year, according to lender Nationwide's figures. And, mortgage approvals as measured by the Bank of England were almost 20,000 higher over a similar period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That pace of increase is notable, and being fed by more first-time buyers with small deposits, suggests that some mortgage approvals could be riskier than the new rules suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People, particularly young people are starting to feel as though now is the right time to buy and that makes me a little uncomfortable," Kate Barker, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and author of the government's 2006 'Review on Housing', told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The government's schemes make it seem that now is the time to get into the market, so some people are stretching themselves, not only to become homeowners, but also to make money as the expectation is that house prices will continue to rise," Ms. Barker, also currently a senior policy adviser for <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barker added that while she has some concerns overall she is in agreement with the Bank of England's view that we're not in a bubble at the moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rightmove's Mr. Shipside, meanwhile, told The Wall Street Journal that the current fast pace of house price inflation is largely down to government schemes enabling a release in pent up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"'Help to Buy' has given lenders confidence, and overall its good for the economy to have a functioning housing market," Mr. Shipside said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthy housing market is indeed key to a growing economy, as consumers move home they spend money which helps to power economic growth and boost business confidence and employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, with supply still below demand further upward momentum in house price growth is pretty certain, and that should set alarm bells ringing, despite the new era of sensible and stricter mortgage lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The shortage of property in the U.K. has been going on for some 20 years and is supporting demand," Mr. Shipside said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, BOE Governor Mark Carney and other BOE members have stated on numerous occasions that while the broad picture of the housing market isn't consistent with a bubble forming, the bank remains vigilant over house prices and ready to intervene if and when it becomes necessary to do so.</p>

</div><div class="author">Dan Molinski </div><div>1233 words</div><div>17 February 2014</div><div>11:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PANAMA CITY—Shipbuilders are cranking out ever-bigger container vessels and the world's major ports are dredging deeper, all on account of an ambitious multibillion-dollar project to widen the Panama Canal—an endeavor currently stalled by a contract dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than just the canal is tangled up in the acrimonious battle between Panama and the builders over $1.6 billion in cost overruns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many cities, countries and port authorities who are spending billions of dollars in anticipation of the traffic that will come from that newly expanded canal," said Adam Putnam, Florida's commissioner of agriculture. "So, there will be an impact if there is an extended delay."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute so far has halted construction for two weeks and now threatens to delay the project by at least three years beyond the proposed completion date of December 2015. Negotiators say they are hopeful of a settlement as soon as Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if resolved, the dispute underscores the difficulties and costs of altering long-range plans, and leaves players throughout the world wondering if further problems will arise in a complex project that already has been delayed by more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The booming U.S. liquefied natural gas industry has been eagerly awaiting the chance to ship exports to Asia on its huge ships via a bigger canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami, meanwhile is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to deepen its harbor and build an underwater tunnel for trucks carrying goods for bigger ships that would use the new canal. Among other industries, citrus growers in Florida are seeking to get their products to Asia and the Pacific coast of Latin America on bigger ships at lower cost, by using a refurbished canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for the canal expansion prompted the shipping world to accelerate the building of larger container vessels, said Jonathan Roach, a senior container analyst at <span class="companylink">Braemar Seascope</span>, a London chartering and ship-broking company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders have been placed for 214 of the so-called neo-Panamax ships—which are as long as four football fields and more than 160 feet high— with sights set on a wider, deeper canal, according to Alphaliner, a shipping-industry trade publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller ships are being taken out of service. So far this year, 14 of the older model Panamax vessels—the biggest shipping vessels now using the canal, holding 4,500 containers—have been scrapped and 40 will be turned into scrap metal by year-end, Mr. Roach said. Last year, only 19 were scrapped. Replacing them are the neo-Panamax vessels, capable of carrying as many as 13,200 containers, each 20 feet in length.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Plans to replace the Panamaxes are well on the way despite the expected delays," Mr. Roach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With those bigger ships in mind, 10 of the largest East Coast and Gulf Coast ports in the U.S. are planning projects costing more than $11 billion to dredge deeper, upgrade terminals and add supersize cranes over the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LNG industry in the U.S. is counting on a larger canal to speed up delivery to energy-hungry Asia, because most LNG ships today are too big for the current Panama canal. Once the canal is enlarged, though, 90% of the tankers carrying the liquefied gas would be able to use the waterway, according to a November study by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Transportation</span>. The canal connects the Caribbean with the Pacific and saves ships an 5,000-mile voyage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very important to us to see the canal completed," said Bill Cooper, president of the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a Washington-based trade association. "Otherwise you're adding a significant amount of time to go all the way around South America, and a significant cost."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Panamanian voters approved the expansion under the premise that revenue from tolls, now more than $1 billion yearly, would double or triple with the arrival of larger ships crossing the 50-mile waterway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Channel dredging, carried out by U.S. and other foreign contractors at a cost of about $2.1 billion, went smoothly. But then on New Year's Day, the European consortium widening the canal said it needed $1.6 billion more on top of the $3.1 billion that had been budgeted for the most expensive part of the project, the construction of locks on either end of the canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After weeks of haggling, the consortium led by Spain's <span class="companylink">Sacyr SA</span> and Italy's <span class="companylink">Impregilo SpA</span> is closer to reaching a deal that hinges on Spain's government supporting Sacyr with a hefty loan, said a person close to the talks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sign of the delay's impact, unknown future costs for transporting LNG to Asia are prompting potential buyers in Asian markets to put off signing long-term contracts with LNG exporters, said Jamie Welch, the chief financial officer for Energy Transfer Partners LP, which plans to convert its Lake Charles, La., facility to export LNG.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think what hurts the most is the longer it becomes protracted, the worse it will be," said Mr. Welch, referring to the talks between the builders and Panama's government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some ports, such as those in Baltimore and Norfolk., Va., were already deep enough for the neo-Panamax vessels. Others, including ports in New York and Miami, were racing to be ready by late 2015, jockeying to win more traffic in the expected shuffling of trade routes that the larger ships are expected to trigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea was to cement business deals before other ports caught up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought we had a window of seven to 10 years to just make hay of our natural assets," said Joe Harris, spokesman for the Port of Virginia, which can already take neo-Panamax vessels. "Maybe that window is shortened a little bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacksonville, Fla., Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C., could benefit, analysts said, because they will now have more time to catch up to ports that began to expand earlier. Savannah is hoping to dredge to 47 feet by late 2017, two years beyond the date canal officials say they hope to finish. Charleston is aiming to reach 50 feet by late 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, multiple interrelated projects—the underground highway to the port, dredging from 42 feet to 50 feet, and the installation of new cranes—will cost $2 billion. All of it is carefully timed to the completion of the canal's expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just days before the delay in Panama began, Bill Johnson, PortMiami's director, touted the foresight of preparing for bigger ships "as the model success story in the nation." In the midst of the delays, he said that "if it drags on for years and years, that's not good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a sense among those closely following the delays that no matter what happens, ever-larger ships will dominate and a deeper, widened canal will be part of the equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's too important to the world," said Curtis Foltz, executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority. "It is going to happen."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and peer <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. have been a rare bright spot in the retail sector as they continue to benefit from the U.S. housing recovery.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-improvement retailer said jobs are available on a market-by-market basis, based on individual store needs and geographical variance in climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the company said it would hire 6,300 associates in Canada for the spring, down from last year's plan to hire 6,700 employees.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, not long after Paul and Kate Anderson and their family arrived at their open-air, glossy-wood beachfront home in Fiji, their daughter and her boyfriend went down the back steps to the sand. The pair returned to announce their engagement; within the hour, the couple's son and his girlfriend were engaged too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This place is magical," said Kate Anderson, 59 years old, gazing at her perfectly framed view of palm fronds and sapphire-blue sea. The Andersons, who get to Fiji via a four-hour flight from Australia, paid $1 million in 2009 to buy the land and build their 6,400-square-foot, five-bedroom home in the Maui Bay Estates development on Viti Levu, Fiji's largest and most populated island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For centuries, this collection of 333 South Pacific islands with a population just over 896,000 has lured adventurers, mercenaries and evangelists (some of whom ended their travels as meals for local cannibals). Now, Fiji attracts an eclectic mix of Australians, New Zealanders, diving enthusiasts and beach-loving romantics who are drawn to its steamy jungles, colorful underwater vistas and endless supply of white-sand seclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a few difficult years following the country's 2006 military coup and the global economic slowdown, Fiji is back on the upswing. In 2012, more than 660,000 people visited Fiji—a 20% increase over 2006, according to Fiji's Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while there are real challenges to buying or building a second home here—including legal issues, corruption and bumpy logistics—many people are jumping in. Along with the return of Australians, New Zealanders and Americans, cash buyers are coming from new places such as China and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a real upswing," said David Miller, director of Taveuni Development, which has developments on three islands, including Maui Bay Estates. The company, which usually sells about 50 lots a year at prices ranging from $35,000 to $475,000, sold 12 lots in January alone—"a record for us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiji fans praise the nation's particular brand of friendliness—Fijians are known for inviting visitors to stay at their homes—and its jungles that creep right to the water's edge. Fiji is "like what the Bahamas was maybe 20 years ago," said Traviss Orr, head of sales for Naisoso Island, a new gated residential and resort development taking shape on a narrow island connected to Viti Levu by a bridge. Prices range from $270,000 for a quarter-acre lot to $700,000 for a half-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there is the cost, which is substantially lower than that for many other tropical destinations. One-acre beachfront lots at Nanuku Resort and Spa, for example, will sell for approximately $1 million, a fraction of the prices in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris and Nicola Alpe, 34, who live in Australia and Los Angeles, are part-owners of Vomo Island Resort, a tiny island with 28 luxury villas that cost about $1,000 to $1,300 a night. Now, they're spending $1 million to build a three-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot vacation home on an acre of beachfront that they hope to rent when they aren't using it, for $3,000 to $5,000 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'll have a picnic, and you can strip off and go snorkeling and never see another person all day," said Mr. Alpe, 63, who proposed to his wife on a small deserted island nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's investment illustrates an important feature of Fijian real estate: Foreigners can't purchase most of its land outright. The former British colony set aside 90% of its land for native ownership—land controlled by Fijian clans who can lease the land to foreigners. So the Alpes paid $600,000 for an acre of leased land; the lease gives them possession of their acre for 99 years—the typical time frame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the contract is up, the terms can be renegotiated. About 6% of Fiji's land is freehold—it can be purchased outright by foreigners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fijian developers and land experts said leases are generally stable, but can become problematic if either side decides to renegotiate the terms or if a dispute develops. Also, while many foreigners build their own homes—the country's modern luxury stock is low and much of its prime beachfront is undeveloped—experts said it is unclear who ultimately owns the homes if a lease is broken or ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiji's political situation also is in flux. The country is run by the military commander who orchestrated a coup. Corruption is an issue. The government has improved the country's legal protections and recently established a real estate licensing board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "you can't fix it overnight," said Ken Chambers, a land-management expert in Fiji. The Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption was set up in 2007 to investigate and prosecute government corruption, according to government officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ruth and David Peterson, retirees from outside Seattle, Wash., spent $1.1 million to purchase freehold land and build their 5,500-square-foot home at Maui Bay in 2007. They said the owners of the neighboring property started using it as a guesthouse for tourists, and the Petersons have since been locked in a battle with the government and the neighbors. "It's been a nightmare," Ruth Peterson said, adding that she doesn't like the noise and disruption of tourists coming and going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annemarie DeVos, who owns the neighboring property, said she received permission from the government to open a small boutique hotel on the site before she purchased and built the property in 2005. An employee with the Department of Town and Country Planning, which handles zoning requests, declined to discuss specific applications but said individual property owners can apply to the government directly for special use zoning, including for tourism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chambers, the land-management expert, said potential buyers should hire a Fiji-based lawyer and check that the title includes easements and restrictive covenants about what can and can't be built around them. Finding a reputable lawyer can be difficult; buyers should research the lawyer's reputation and track record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russell Pflueger, a 50-year-old developer of medical devices, and David Kohler, a 53-year-old owner of a sports memorabilia company, and their wives bought a 4,500-square-foot home on freehold land for $2.5 million in 2006, as part of a development that went bankrupt. The lenders, Chicago's Bixby Bridge Capital, took over and invested another $15 million to finish and improve the resort and residential development, rebranding it Nanuku Resort and Spa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was unsettling," said Orange County, Calif.-based Mr. Pflueger, who with the others gets to Fiji via an 11-hour direct flight from Los Angeles. But the new owners "have done an amazing job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westerners also caution newcomers about Fiji's island culture, which doesn't always meet Western expectations of planning and punctuality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally from northern California, Bob Facciola, a 77-year-old former owner of a wholesale food-distribution company, and Marie Peyman, a 65-year-old former professional horse trainer, spent $1 million on an acre of freehold land and are building a retreat with separate, free-standing bedroom suites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home, at the tip of the island between an ocean inlet and the Pacific, has soaring ceilings framed in timber lashed together with traditional Fijian materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair stressed the importance of finding a builder with experience in Fiji and who plans ahead—ordering materials and supplies months in advance to avoid cyclone season and shipping delays—and can manage complex sourcing. The couple hired a U.S.-trained Fijian architect and a New Zealand builder who relocated to Fiji. The total estimated cost of the project is about $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Andersons, whose children got engaged at their house, said they had to give up a planned infinity pool when they couldn't find a builder with the expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Andersons said they love Fiji's relaxed pace and exotic charms. As they spoke, their housekeeper, a local woman, turned out platters of warm, sticky-sweet pastries topped with freshly grated coconut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent evening, the South Pacific glimmered in their doorway. Soon it would be time for the Andersons favorite ritual: sunset gin and tonics on the deck, just for the two of them.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of a 25,000-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion spared no expense in building their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mediterranean-style house, now on the market for $55 million, comes with a single-lane bowling alley, according to the listing agents Justin Mandile and Mauricio Umansky of the Agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 2010, the house has eight bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and four half-baths, Mr. Mandile said. In addition to the bowling alley, the gated estate has indoor and outdoor pools, a gym, a billiards room and a wine cellar. There are two elevators, one of which goes to the master suite. A master bedroom closet also contains a concealed doorway that leads to the bedroom next door, currently configured as a nursery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Off the main kitchen is a prep kitchen, bedroom and a full bathroom intended for use by a private chef. Overlooking the pool area, which is lined with greenery including conifer trees, there's a large circular fire pit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is owned by Elias Shokrian, a commercial-real-estate developer and investor. Mr. Mandile, a family friend, said when Mr. Shokrian and his wife Shirley bought the property in 1989, there was an older house on the site where they lived for years and raised their children. Recently, they tore the house down and built the existing structure. They are selling because their children are now grown, and the parents "don't really need all that room," Mr. Mandile said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mystery writer Sue Grafton has reduced the asking price on her Montecito, Calif., home to $9.6 million. The 2-acre estate was initially listed in August 2013 for $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 7,300-square-foot main house has four bedrooms, each with an ocean-view terrace. There's a separate building which Ms. Grafton used as an office for writing, but could be used as a guesthouse. A pool house is currently configured as a gym. Also in the pool area, two pergolas provide a shaded area for sitting. "It's a wonderful house for entertaining," said Ms. Grafton, 73 years old, who hosted her daughter's wedding on the property in 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Grafton, best known for her "Alphabet Series" of novels including "'A' Is for Alibi" and her latest, "'W' is for Wasted," said she and her husband bought the property in 1995. But they recently decided to build a new house on a lot they owned next door, where they moved in 2010. The purchaser of this property will be her neighbor, Ms. Grafton said, quipping: "whoever buys the house can borrow sugar any time they want!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agents are Rebecca Riskin, Sarah Kelly and Dina Landi of Riskin Associates at Village Properties Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Vero Beach, Fla., beachfront house owned by Nicholas Perricone, a dermatologist and founder of the eponymous skin-care company, is on the market for $16.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in the private John's Island gated community, the house has more than 14,000 square feet and five bedrooms, six full and two half baths. The 2.3-acre property has about 93 feet of frontage on the Atlantic, with a private wooden walkway leading from the pool area to the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there, Dr. Perricone said he spends most of his time sitting by the pool or on a second-floor terrace overlooking the ocean, where he likes to drink tea and listen to the waves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the time, I sit outside," he said, adding that the house is "a place to really recharge my batteries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perricone said that while he believes it's important to get some sun to build up vitamin D, he avoids too much exposure to the Florida rays, often choosing to sit on one of the home's covered loggias.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perricone paid $10 million in 2009 for the home, which had been built on spec in 2007. Dr. Perricone bought the house fully furnished in a navy-blue and white palette by Palm Beach designer Jack Fhillips for "a polo look." (Mr. Fhillips said the home has "a bit of a nautical, sea captain's motif.") Those furnishings are now being offered for sale along with the house. "I don't want to be bothered with moving furniture," the dermatologist said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Perricone said he is selling because his business has kept him busier than expected, leaving him little time to visit the house. "I just never get to use it," he said. "I really wanted to use it more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agents are Cindy O'Dare and Clark French of Premier Estate Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Bel Air estate on just over 3½ acres is going on the market for $43 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is one of the largest in Los Angeles, said listing agent Rick Hilton, a co-founder of Hilton &amp; Hyland. Its Hollywood Regency-style home is approximately 10,000 square feet, with eight bedrooms and nine bathrooms. The estate also has a pool, a four-car garage and parking for about 15 additional cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, built in 1963, was the longtime home of William H. Doheny, Sr. and his wife Onnalee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doheny was the grandson of oil baron Edward Laurence Doheny, Sr., and as a child he lived in the family's Greystone estate, which is now an 18-acre public park owned by the city of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Doheny was a prolific gardener, said her son William H. Doheny Jr., who said his parents bought this property in part because it had previously been used as a botanical garden and was planted with a number of exotic specimen trees. She spent much of her time working in the extensive gardens on the secluded estate, which has views of the Pacific, he said. Mr. Doheny, Sr. died in 2003 and his wife last year, their son said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This area, inside the East Gate on Bel Air Road, is "the bull's-eye of Bel Air—the finest part," said Mr. Hilton. Mr. Hilton, whose grandfather founded the Hilton Hotel empire, lives three doors down from the Doheny estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hilton shares the listing with Judy Feder, Jeff Hyland, Mich Rogers and Tyrone McKillen, all of Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity has put his waterfront Long Island home on the market for $3.6 million. According to public records, he purchased the home for $3.45 million in 2003. Mr. Hannity referred questions about the property to listing agents Elena D'Agostino and Joyce Mennella of Signature Premier Properties. Ms. D'Agostino said she didn't know Mr. Hannity's reasons for selling, but she said he has another Long Island home. The story was previously reported by Newsday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that Dwight Howard has moved to the <span class="companylink">Houston Rockets</span>, the former <span class="companylink">Orlando Magic</span> star is selling his mansion in Longwood, Fla. Mr. Howard has listed the 11,025-square-foot home for $4.9 million, less than the $7.78 million he paid for the property in 2008, according to public records. Listing agent Wayne Weger of Keene's Pointe Realty said that Mr. Howard purchased the home before the real-estate market hit bottom. The story was previously reported by Realtor.com. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WARSAW—The Polish government fired its roads agency director Thursday, blaming him for massive construction delays and tensions within the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lech Witecki was dismissed after six years in the job as the agency he headed failed to complete a number of projects on schedule, according to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gravest mistakes were many delays and bad atmosphere in the agency's cooperation with contractors and the entire construction sector," said Deputy Prime Minister Elzbieta Bienkowska, who is in charge of allocating <span class="companylink">European Union</span> funding and the country's transport infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of Poland's new highway construction push in 2014-2020, the agency needs "fresh stamina," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades of central planning left Poland with decrepit roads and no highways when Communism collapsed in Europe after 1989. The country now has nearly 2,700 kilometers of highways, but major areas and key cities still lie outside the network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roads agency recently said it would still need many months and, in some cases, years to complete sections of the country's highways that were supposed to open ahead of the UEFA European soccer championship finals held in Poland and Ukraine in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Witecki wasn't available for comment on Thursday. However, he said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal that some builders arrived in Poland unprepared and that his agency wasn't to blame for the financial problems of builders from other EU countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those companies began bidding aggressively after projects stopped in Spain," Mr. Witecki said. "Especially when dealing with companies that were doing projects here for the first time, the fundamental issue was a lack of progress immediately after the start of the project."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After signing, it took three or four months to start work instead of one month, some contractors would lose the winter season and this translated into penalties for missing milestones," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had a budget of 74 billion zlotys ($24 billion) for roads in 2007-2013, of which about 60% was financed by the EU from funds allocated for poorer member states. It hasn't yet provided details of the cost of constructing some 1,800 kilometers of new roads planned for 2014-2020, when it will have a budget of around $37 billion for all infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The abundance of projects and money for Poland's road building has attracted many companies, mostly from within Poland but also Spain, Germany and Austria. However, some firms have run into financial difficulties, blaming their woes on Poland's rigid public procurement laws, thin margins and bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition is fierce, with just under 300 companies filing bids in recent years for contracts tendered by the government. But Mr. Witecki argued that only a minority of them have run into financial difficulty, without naming any firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If someone asks why it's so bad, then I say that out of more than 170 projects over the past five years we had problems in 10 or 11 cases, while we've built more than 2,500 kilometers of roads," he said.</p>

Home Depot to Hire 80,000 for Spring Season; Retailer, Peers Continue to Benefit From Housing Recovery</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span> . said Wednesday it will hire 80,000 workers in the U.S. as it prepares for spring, its busiest sales period, matching last year's hiring level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and peer <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span> . have been a rare bright spot in the retail sector as they continue to benefit from the U.S. housing recovery. Rising home prices and improvements in home construction and new home sales have led homeowners to open their wallets for remodeling projects or big-ticket items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-improvement retailer said jobs are available on a market-by-market basis, based on individual store needs and geographical variance in climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the company said it would hire 6,300 associates in Canada for the spring, down from last year's plan to hire 6,700 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> currently employs more than 300,000 associates and said it has 2,263 stores across North America.

</div><div class="author">Jesse Newman </div><div>1303 words</div><div>12 February 2014</div><div>18:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broker Pat Karst thought the farm being auctioned late last month would be scooped up. The 98-acre plot was of decent quality, and the volunteer fire station in Arlington, Ind., where his firm was holding the sale, was packed with farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the evening ended with the latest in a spate of failed auctions, after the top bidder dropped out far below the asking price. "The moral of the story is: unrealistic expectations from sellers and more caution on the side of the buyer," said Mr. Karst, who acknowledged he, too, thought the property would fetch a higher price than offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flop reflects a broader turning point in one of the U.S.'s biggest recent asset booms. From 2009 to mid-2013, average prices for agricultural land in the U.S. rose by half, while in Iowa, Nebraska and some other Midwest farm states, prices more than doubled, according to <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> data from last August. That helped fuel economic prosperity across the Farm Belt while stoking fears about a possible bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now there is mounting evidence the boom is fizzling out. Farmland prices in Iowa fell 3% over the second half of last year, and those in Nebraska fell 1%, according to estimates from the Farm Credit Services of America, an Omaha, Neb., lender that calculates weighted averages based on land quality. Reports from U.S. Federal Reserve Banks across the Midwest late last year showed prices flattening or slipping from the previous quarter. A monthly survey of Midwestern lenders by Omaha-based Creighton University in January found the outlook for farmland and ranchland prices was the weakest in more than four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the falling property values, agricultural analysts say a repeat of past farm-belt collapses is unlikely. Farmer income is expected to remain strong and debt levels are low, according to USDA figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices have plunged for corn, a key U.S. crop. After rising to all-time highs in 2012—driven by growing demand and tight supply because of a historic drought—prices for the biggest U.S. crop dropped 40% last year, thanks to a record harvest of 14 billion bushels. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> warned in January that corn prices, then around $4.28 a bushel, won't cover farmers' anticipated cost of raising the crop this year. Prices have since climbed to about $4.40 a bushel, compared with about $8.31 in August 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soybeans, the nation's No. 2 crop, have also lost value. Meanwhile, with the Fed scaling back its stimulus efforts, buyers of U.S. farmland face the prospect of higher interest rates after years of cheap borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shifts have forced farmers to recalculate the value of productive land. Greg Plunk, a third-generation Illinois farmer who added 80 acres to his farm over the past two years, said he would be more careful with further purchases. "Profits will be tighter, there's not going to be near the returns, and guys will have to be careful how much expenses they've got into an acre," said Mr. Plunk, 53 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling land prices could cause economic ripples, curbing farmers' ability to borrow money to buy new acreage, crop supplies or machinery. Land secures many of those loans. Mark Jensen, chief risk officer at Farm Credit Services of America, said half of its $20 billion portfolio consists of real-estate loans secured by farmland. As credit quality deteriorates, farmers will use more land as collateral, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pullback in farmers' spending could curtail construction of grain bins and livestock facilities as well as purchases of new machinery. Tractor company <span class="companylink">Deere &amp; Co</span>. predicted Wednesday that sales of farm equipment in the U.S. and Canada this year would decline 5% to 10% from 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farmland boom began roughly a decade ago. Prices slumped briefly in 2009, amid the recession, then rebounded, thanks in part to historically low interest rates. Overall, values of some fertile Midwestern land nearly tripled over the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent turn has been abrupt. "There was lots of land around here selling for close to $10,000 an acre, but it's tapered off quickly," said Kevin Kremer, 56, an Indiana farmer who recently won a tract of land for roughly $8,800 an acre at an auction in Burnettsville, Ind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter is typically the busiest time in the county-fairground buildings and American Legion halls where fast-talking auctioneers deal swaths of land. But this season has seen a growing number of "no sale" auctions. After the unsuccessful 98-acre auction by Mr. Karst last month, the land sold a week later for $880,000, about 10% less than what the sellers wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Iowa, the biggest corn and soybean-producing state, 6.7% of farmland auctions failed in 2013, more than double the 2012 percentage, according to Farm Credit Services of America. The total number of auctions fell 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As land prices were soaring, some economists and lenders raised alarms. The Federal Advisory Council, a group of 12 banking leaders that advises the Fed, wrote a year ago that farmland prices were "veering further from what makes sense from a production standpoint," amounting to "a bubble resulting from persistently low interest rates." The same group noted this past December that "prices are flat and may be receding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the sputtering growth is prompting more caution than panic. But economists are watching closely. "The question is, if there's a fall, how fast the fall happens," said Nathan Kauffman, Omaha branch executive of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span>, who tracks farmland prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic picture in the Farm Belt is expected to worsen. The USDA forecast Tuesday that U.S. farm incomes will dive 27% this year from 2013, to $95.8 billion, which would be the lowest level since 2010. Last year's total was the highest since 1973 on an inflation-adjusted basis, but the continued slump in grain prices is expected to this year outweigh the benefits of having more corn and soybeans to sell. Still, even with the expected decline, the USDA reckons incomes will remain $8 billion above the previous 10-year average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Duffy, professor of economics at <span class="companylink">Iowa State University</span> in Ames, Iowa, projects lower income for farmers could drive the price of farmland down 20% to 25% over the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other observers point to factors that could cushion or reverse the market decline, including an unexpected resurgence in the price of corn and soybeans. Some buyers say they are waiting to pounce if prices fall, which also could help keep any decline from turning into a rout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think this next 12 months is going to be the best window we've had in the past five years" to invest in farmland, said Greyson Colvin, managing partner at investment manager Colvin &amp; Co., which owns about 7,000 acres of farmland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding comfort, today's agricultural sector looks markedly different than it did during the last farmland bust, in the early 1980s. Then, a roughly 50% drop in land values and rising interest rates led to high levels of debt when viewed as a percentage of farmers' assets. That forced many farmers out of business and spurred failures among dozens of agricultural lenders. Farmers' debt-to-asset ratio is currently estimated at 10.3%, less than half what it was in 1985, according to the USDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a sharp fall in property prices could affect a farmer's balance sheet, said Mr. Kauffman, the economist. "If land values do drop, that could have some important implications for solvency."</p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington  </div><div>457 words</div><div>12 February 2014</div><div>14:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—A more than four-year low in housing for sale helped U.K. home prices to continue rising in January, according to a monthly survey issued Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of increased mortgage availability and a drop in the supply of housing for sale meant demand to purchase a property remained strong in the first month of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January house-price balance slid to +53 from December's +56, according to the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> monthly housing market survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house-price balance is calculated by subtracting the number of surveyors who reported a fall in prices from those who said house prices rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also showed that the average number of homes for sale per estate agency fell to 59 in January, the lowest level since mid-2009 and down from 60.4 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's no secret that we are seeing prices go up in many parts of the country, driven largely by the lack of properties coming onto the market," said Peter Bolton-King, RICS global residential director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With more people now in a position to buy a home than at any point over the past few years, there are simply not enough properties to satisfy demand. The upshot of this is increasing prices in many areas and this looks set to continue for the foreseeable future," Mr. Bolton-King said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey—which also shows surveyors continue to expect prices to rise over the coming year—remains in line with other housing market indicators and shows that while average prices are below the 2007 precrisis peak, they are rapidly moving toward that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While remaining vigilant over house-price developments, economists and policy makers, however, maintain that a house-price bubble isn't a threat at present.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean it won't happen though, and with the average house price just £8,000 ($13,159) below the 2007 peak, according to lender Nationwide's figures, it could be closer than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of surveyors expecting an increase in properties for sale fell to a balance of +32 in January from +55 in December and +75 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that decline, the traditional Spring boost to the housing market may confound those expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of our members have told us that, as the daffodils come out, more vendors could be looking to test the market as the traditional spring bounce begins to take effect. This can only be good news for a market that has seen supply struggle for a long, long time," Mr. Bolton-King said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>630 words</div><div>12 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the hottest U.S. real-estate markets started to cool in last year's fourth quarter as higher interest rates and sticker shock pushed some buyers to the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the median price of an existing home rose 10.1% in the fourth quarter to $196,900 from a year earlier, according to a report released Tuesday by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, which tracked 164 markets. In the third quarter the median price rose 12.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slightly less than three out of four markets saw year-over-year price gains in the fourth quarter and about a quarter saw double-digit percentage increases. In the third quarter, about 88% of markets saw year-over-year price increases, a third with double digits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest gains continue to be in markets that were hard hit by the real estate bust and have seen a frenzy of investor interest during the past year. Many of those markets, however, have cooled a bit, which real-estate agents contend is a good thing because the price run-up had started to scare off buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta -- where 33.3% price growth in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago was the fastest in the nation, pushing the median cost of a home to $142,400 -- growth slowed from 41.8% in the third quarter over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other cities that saw 20% or better growth in the fourth quarter, such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, Jacksonville, Fla., and Sacramento, Calif., saw price growth slow from the prior quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a marked slowdown in buyers wanting to make a purchase. Why are they taking a second look? In my view, it is largely due to affordability coming down sharply, especially in areas where price increases have been 20% or 30%," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist. "Some (buyers) may be pushed out of the market. But even people who qualify are asking the question: 'With prices increasing that fast, can it reverse?' A sudden price change of that magnitude gives a pause to buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum, the most depressed markets continue to be across upstate New York and the industrial Midwest. In cities such as Elmira, N.Y., Fort Wayne, Ind., and Champaign, Ill., prices fell 9.5% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. recovery in home prices continues to be propelled by the twin forces of tight inventory and a falling share of distressed sales that drag down area prices. Distressed sales -- foreclosures and short sales that usually are snapped up at a discount by neighbors -- accounted for 14% of the fourth-quarter sales, down from 24% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory eked up to a 4.9-month supply at the current sales pace, from 4.8 months a year ago. A "balanced" market has somewhere around a 6-month supply of homes, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed that while most U.S. home markets are affordable to households earning the median income, a number of select markets clustered around the West Coast have seen prices steeply outpace income growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the nation's five most expensive markets were in California. The biggest affordability problems have been around the San Francisco Bay Area, where big gains in employment -- much of it in the booming technology sector -- have exacerbated a long-run housing shortage and pushed prices to the highest in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Jose metro area was the nation's most expensive in the fourth quarter, with a median single family home price of $775,000. SanFrancisco was second with a median home price of $682,400.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kris Hudson </div><div>779 words</div><div>6 February 2014</div><div>14:43</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices aren't the only thing rebounding amid the housing market recovery. Hundreds more home products were on display this week at the annual International Builders' Show in Las Vegas as builders, designers and architects prepare for a year of increasing construction, remodeling and home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sprinkled throughout the sprawling exhibit floor at the Las Vegas Convention Center were displays of upscale and unusual items ranging from 12-foot-long gas fireplaces to kid-size toilets. Attendees perused luxe wine cabinets, fancy faucets that display water temperature and the latest in home-automation systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the Builders' Show alone attracted 1,220 exhibitors this year, up from 980 last year. And the show's combination this year for the first time with the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show brought a few hundred more vendors to the lineup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a look at a few offerings that caught our eye on the exhibit floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house doesn't need logs to be a log cabin. Modulog Industries , a Portland, Ore., company founded by former logger Ron Berge, produces siding made of Western red cedar for the outside of a home, with log ends and custom-made trim. The kiln-dried panels, measuring 7 inches wide, 1½ inches thick and up to 16 feet long, affix to the house with stainless-steel staples. "You can't tell the difference until you walk inside the home," Modulog President James Iafrati says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $9,000 to $14,000 (typical house)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a hot trend in contemporary design: linear fireplaces. Travis Industries of Mukilteo, Wash., offers gas and electric fireplaces stretching from 5 to 20 feet across. The company's da Vinci custom-made fireplaces, sold to home builders and architects, feature a crushed-glass floor, from which the flames emerge, and adjustable colored lighting. Its more modest Xtreme by Fireplace Xtrordinair spans 5 feet wide and 20 inches tall, with steel trim around its glass face. Its logs are hand-painted ceramic that looks like driftwood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $2,200 to $35,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art often relies on unusual media. Tim "Tiny" Salazar, a remodeling and construction contractor in Commerce City, Colo., found his in recycled bottles. His BottleLicious uses a proprietary technique in which glass bottles are melted flat for use in wall-mounted art or as functional features, such as an ornate kitchen backsplash. Mr. Salazar makes each piece to buyer's specifications, using various colors, frames and bottles, including keepsakes provided by the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $750 to $7,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who want their pet to bathe in style rather than getting hosed down in the backyard, there are industrial wash tubs with spray nozzles and other fixtures by Omaha company Forever Stainless Steel. The tubs, as large as 2.5 feet by 5 feet, stand on steel legs so owners don't have to bend over to wash their companion. Some models include a removable ramp so willing pets can deliver themselves to their spa bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $2,000 to $6,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danver Stainless Steel Outdoor Kitchens is adding more style to its sturdy steel cabinetry for outdoor use. The Wallingford, Conn., manufacturer unveiled new colors—earth tones and light metallic shades—for its line of outdoor cabinets at the Builders' Show. It already offers several cabinet-door designs, including multipanels, Shaker and beadboard. The cabinets dovetail with the trend of homeowners converting covered patios and pergolas into outdoor kitchens with high-end grills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: Typically $10,000 to $25,000 for a set</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend of designing with lighter-colored metals has advanced to cabinet doors. KraftMaid, the upscale cabinet brand owned by <span class="companylink">Masco Corp</span> ., unveiled at the Builders' Show a line of cabinet doors framed in light champagne bronze. The KraftMaid Vetro Champagne Bronze Door comes with a center of either clear or frosted glass outlined by the bronze frame. They come with either a wall-top hinge or side hinge. <span class="companylink">Masco</span> anticipates the doors will be popular with the designers and remodelers that its KraftMaid brand targets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: Starting at $500 per cabinet door</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foodies and culinary enthusiasts want options. BSH Home Appliances' Thermador brand tries to provide them with the Pro Grand Steam Range, a stainless-steel range that combines multiple cooking elements. Its 48-inch cooktop includes six burners, a griddle and a grill. Parked under the grill and burners are lava rocks that provide a smoke-grilled flavor. Below, it offers a large, conventional oven, a warming drawer and a steam oven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price: $15,399 </p>

</div><div class="author">Candace Taylor </div><div>834 words</div><div>6 February 2014</div><div>14:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sales boom is shifting some of the longstanding laws that governed the Hamptons, the pricey resort communities on the eastern end of Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity in the Hamptons is now on par with, or even higher than, the mid-2000s peaks. While prices are still below boom-time levels, most of the inventory from the recession has now been absorbed. And in some areas, "there are more buyers than sellers," says real-estate broker Andrew Saunders of Saunders &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, buyers and renters are widening their search to areas previously viewed as less desirable. Even the once-titanic divide between north and south of Montauk Highway is less pronounced. Because of their proximity to the ocean, homes south of the highway have long been the most expensive, but houses to the north are now seeing more demand than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a guide to the personality of the housing market in eight Hamptons villages and hamlets—from genteel Southampton to the new money mansions of Sagaponack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOUTHAMPTON Southampton Village, with 7 miles of beachfront on the Atlantic, has long been a bastion of old money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the estate section, grand historic homes sit on grassy lawns concealed by hedge rows to protect owners' privacy. But the requirement for a blue-blooded pedigree is fading, agents say, as long-standing Southampton families sell compounds to newcomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Summer rentals are expensive: Harald Grant of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> is listing an 18,000-square-foot rental on 10 acres in the estate section. The price: $900,000, for Memorial Day to Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST HAMPTON Smaller than Southampton, East Hampton Village also has grand estates dating to the Victorian era. But while Southampton is known for being understated and discreet, East Hampton has a more artistic, glamorous vibe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where celebrities come to nest: Martha Stewart, Ron Perelman, Jerry Seinfeld and Sean "Diddy" Combs. The village's Main Street has its own <span class="companylink">Tiffany &amp; Co</span>. A house on Further Lane closed for $62.5 million in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WAINSCOTT This hamlet borders sought-after Georgica Pond, site of the exclusive <span class="companylink">Georgica Association</span>. Despite its small size, the hamlet is home to "tremendous wealth," says Judi Desiderio of Town &amp; Country real estate, due in part to its proximity to East Hampton Airport—helpful for commuting by private plane.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wainscott has only a few oceanfront lots—one is on the market for $23.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAGAPONACK In the past two decades, Wall Streeters have discovered once-rural Sagaponack, where they've built sprawling mansions on former potato fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sagaponack buyers tend to be younger, and their money newer, than those in Southampton or East Hampton. The village has almost no retail and few historic homes. But that doesn't deter buyers lured by the wide-open ocean views, which contrast sharply to the hedge rows found in other areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRIDGEHAMPTON Also rural for most of its history, Bridgehampton is big with the horse crowd. A popular event each year is the Hampton Classic Horse Show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bridgehampton also is popular with Wall Street types, many of whom choose the area because it has less restrictive zoning than Sagaponack. "In Bridgehampton, you can create a much larger home on a smaller lot," says Mr. Saunders. The hamlet does have a small commercial strip with restaurants such as Bobby Van's Steakhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WATER MILL Large estates were built on Mecox Bay in the early 1900s, but much of the hamlet was undeveloped. Now, there are many lavish new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water Mill is popular with executives and celebrities; residents include Jennifer Lopez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rentals range from a 3,400-square-foot house on an acre asking $50,000 for the summer, according to the real estate listings website StreetEasy.com, to a 10,000-square-foot home on 2.7 acres that asks $475,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMAGANSETTCorcoran Group broker Susan Breitenbach refers to Amagansett as "the TriBeCa of the Hamptons." The hamlet has several popular eateries and bars like the Stephen Talkhouse nightclub, where Jon Bon Jovi has performed unannounced. Actress Scarlett Johansson bought a $2.2 million house in the Amagansett Dunes about a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are a bit lower. According to StreetEasy, summer rents range from $18,000 for a three-bedroom beach cottage to $525,000 for a seven-bedroom, 9½-bathroom estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAG HARBOR A once-gritty former whaling village, Sag Harbor is now one of the most popular areas for dining and shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are going to Sag Harbor who in the past would have ended up in East Hampton," said Noble Black, an agent at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> in Manhattan who paid $1.75 million in August for a home here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its narrow streets and boutiques, Sag Harbor is "a little bohemian, a little funky," says Ms. Breitenbach, the agent. "You're not going to see Tiffany's."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family of Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., the late billionaire businessman and philanthropist, is listing his longtime Manhattan home with Brown Harris Stevens for $65 million, the brokerage said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penthouse, on Fifth Avenue, between 77th and 78th streets on the Upper East Side, is in a prewar co-op and has 16 rooms, which includes five bedrooms and 8½ bathrooms, and a wraparound terrace overlooking Central Park. Square footage couldn't be determined but it is a full floor, the brokerage said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bronfman, chairman of the Seagram Co. and president of the World Jewish Congress, died in December at age 84. He lived in the apartment for about 40 years, said Brown Harris Stevens. The Bronfman family declined to comment. The listing agents are Mary Rutherfurd, Alina Pedroso and Leslie Coleman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 16,350-square-foot mansion in Barcelona, Spain, has recently listed for about $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built on nearly 4 acres, the six-bedroom, eight-bathroom house has a billiards room, a swimming pool and sauna, a hot tub, a library and three gardens. Located in Sarrià, one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of the Spanish city, the 104-year old house has easy access to top schools and transport. It also enjoys some of Barcelona's best views of the sea and mountains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built between 1904 and 1910, the house is an example of Catalan modernism, an architectural style in vogue at the end of the 19th century that was characterized by an effort to emulate nature. The house was purchased in 1987 and restored by current owner Antoni Guinovart between 1989 and 1991. In 1993, he added parking and an elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When restoring the house, Mr. Guinovart said he made sure he kept its modernist features. Mr. Guinovart said he followed the conventional wisdom that "less is more" when refurbishing the place because introducing other styles was "risky." However, the kitchen was modernized to make it "more practical, spacious and clean." A retired developer, Mr. Guinovart, 62, said he is selling because his kids have left home and he is looking to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barcelona, along with the rest of the Spanish real-estate market, experienced a collapse of property prices on the back of the financial crisis. Even high-end products didn't completely escape, and some developments have seen price drops of nearly 40%. A recent forecast by <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> and the Urban Land Institute has said the market is turning a corner and investor confidence has improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harriet Beecher Stowe was the mother of six when she sat down to write the novel that would become "Uncle Tom's Cabin." According to Arline Pennell Lay, Ms. Stowe's home in Brunswick, Maine, was too noisy for her to get any work done. So the abolitionist rented a room in a nearby house. That is where, between 1850 and 1851, much of the novel was written in a room on the second floor, said Ms. Lay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That nearby house, which is owned by Ms. Lay, is now on the market for $3 million with Teles Properties agents Ernie Carswell and Karen Nation. The family said receipts were found in the house showing rent that Ms. Stowe paid for her room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lays said they have worked hard to preserve the historical character of their roughly 3,500-square-foot, six-bedroom, one-bath white clapboard house, built in the late 1700s. For that reason, there is only one bathroom, though a buyer could add a bathroom on the third floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house has been in Ms. Lay's family since the early 1900s. Ms. Lay said she is selling because her husband died two years ago and the house is too big for one person. But the family wants to ensure that the buyer will keep the home intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the only townhouses on Manhattan's Central Park has been relisted for $29.95 million, or 19% less than its original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was listed this spring for $37 million by <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> and was subsequently taken off the market after several price cuts. It is now co-listed by David Kornmeier of Brown Harris Stevens and Matthew Lesser of Leslie J. Garfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landmark Queen Anne-style brick-and-limestone house is 22 feet wide with seven bedrooms, six full bathrooms and two half bathrooms, Mr. Kornmeier said. The home has about 10,745 square feet of living space. There is a finished basement with a gym and 60-foot-long lap pool. An elevator serves five levels. The home was one of nine constructed in 1888 by speculative builder William Noble, of which three remain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is owned by Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist Igor Iankovsky, who paid $22.375 million in 2011 to purchase the property from former Coach President Keith D. Monda, according to public records. Mr. Monda, in turn, had purchased it from Abigail Disney, <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span>'s grandniece, according to co-listing agent Mr. Lesser, who represented Mr. Iankovsky in his purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Disney and Mr. Monda renovated and modernized the home, Mr. Lesser said, adding that the current price is "more in line" with the market than the original $37 million asking price. Mr. Iankovsky declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lesser said Mr. Iankovsky originally intended to relocate his family to New York, but their situation has changed and they are no longer planning to move to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that he is headed to Alabama, former <span class="companylink">University of Southern California</span> head football coach Lane Kiffin is unloading real estate in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December Mr. Kiffin, who was fired by <span class="companylink">USC</span> in September, listed his 7,300-square-foot house in Manhattan Beach for $6.995 million and a townhouse in El Segundo for $745,000, according to public records. Both properties were listed with Bryn Stroyke of Stroyke Properties. Mr. Stroyke declined to comment on ownership, but said that the townhouse has sold for $737,500 and that the house is now in contract. Mr. Kiffin couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Keiko Morris   </div><div>838 words</div><div>5 February 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New Jersey property investment firm spent $85.25 million last year to buy a 16-story apartment building in Rego Park, Queens. The firm, Treetop Development LLC, is spending another $7 million on upgrades to the building, called Saxon Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Teaneck, N.J., company, which already had investments in New Jersey and Manhattan, is now negotiating to buy two other properties in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For years Queens lagged behind Manhattan and Brooklyn in terms of growth and only now is catching up," said Adam Mermelstein, a principal at Treetop. "We'd like to be part of the upswing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a report to be released today, Treetop has plenty of company in the booming market for apartment properties. Investors spent $1.36 billion to buy multifamily properties in Queens in 2013, more than double the amount in 2012 and almost 3.5 times the amount spent in 2011, according to the report from Ariel Property Advisors, a real-estate investment sales company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While multifamily property sales in other New York City sectors also rose, the growth in Queens was the steepest outside of Staten Island, which Ariel Property Advisors doesn't track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the migration of renters priced out of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, real-estate investors have focused their attention on northwest Queens neighborhoods such as Long Island City, Astoria, Sunnyside, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those areas boast amenities such as restaurants and shops and are within a half-hour train commute to midtown Manhattan, said Michael A. Tortorici, vice president of Ariel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's real value in areas like Astoria and Long Island City with comparable commutes," Mr. Tortorici said. "And they can get all of that for a price that's less expensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and investors buying property in Queens last year included newcomers and veterans of the borough, many of them looking for stable and strong income from rental buildings. The Benedict Realty Group LLC, a longtime Queens landlord, purchased 19 rental buildings in Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona for more than $68 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the Queens market had 519 sales transactions of investment properties, including multifamily buildings, development sites and commercial properties. Those sales totaled about $2.8 billion, a 46% increase from $1.9 billion in sales in 2012, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of development sites -- where many expect multifamily projects to rise -- climbed 59%, to $987 million, in 2013, the report revealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the increases are significant, Mr. Tortorici noted that the sales and property transaction figures for Queens in previous years were low compared with other New York City markets. Manhattan's multifamily property sales south of East 96th Street and West 110th Street reached $6.6 billion in 2013, a 10% increase from the prior year. Brooklyn's multifamily property sales rose 29%, to $1.9 billion, in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate investors in Queens said they turned to the borough because they found Manhattan pricing for properties exorbitant, making it difficult for them to figure out how to make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Forest Properties Management Inc</span>., a Massachusetts company that owns and operates rental properties on the East Coast, looked at Williamsburg, Brooklyn, but ended up making its first New York City investment in Astoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company partnered with real-estate investor Jeff Greene and purchased the Exo, a 14-story rental building with a doorman, for $47.2 million. Two-bedroom apartments there range between $2,800 and $3,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Astoria was really interesting to us because pricing for property was a lot better" than markets in Brooklyn and Manhattan, said Anderson Libert, director of acquisitions for Forest Properties. "You can make money out of the box."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Momentum for development and multifamily sales throughout Queens is expected to continue with a number of projects in the pipeline, according to the report from Ariel Property Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Related Companies and Sterling Equities are set to begin construction on a $3 billion mixed-use development at Willets Point, near Flushing. And the first phase of construction for Flushing Commons, an $850 million mixed-use project in Flushing, likely will begin this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike new developments in Astoria, the long-delayed Flushing Commons project includes residential condo units, catering to Flushing's large Asian population, which tends to buy rather than rent, said John T. Livingston, CEO of AECOM Capital, the investment arm of <span class="companylink">AECOM Technology Corp</span>. AECOM Capital joined TDC Development and Construction Corp. and <span class="companylink">the Rockefeller Group</span> in the project about six months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to being a dense market, Flushing has access to public transportation and isn't far from La Guardia and John F. Kennedy airports. The project will offer residential condo units that will probably be half the price of similar property in Manhattan, Mr. Livingston said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Flushing, Queens, is such a hub of commercial and retail activity," Mr. Livingston said. "We're not the first to figure that out."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HENDERSON, Nev. -- It has been nearly three years since builder Josh Anderson purchased 36 distressed lots just outside of Las Vegas for an average of about $90,000 each, hoping that a bet on troubled land would pay off once the market turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes well this week, his gamble could result in a jackpot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the lots Mr. Anderson bought was used to build the "New American Home," the name given to a model home that captures the latest design trends and is unveiled annually at the International Builders' Show. This year's show, a mega convention expected to attract 80,000 members of the home-building and home-renovation industry, opened in Las Vegas on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home, a sprawling 6,700-square-foot abode with five bedrooms, elevator and rooftop terrace, soon will be listed for sale with a price tag of about $5 million. Mr. Anderson, founder of Element Building Co., hopes that the thousands of people who tour the home -- and the national publicity that ensues -- will help him sell additional lots for between $200,000 and $1 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the economic downturn, land prices were so depressed that buying then seemed risky. But now "some of these deals are starting to make sense," said Greg Gross, a regional director with Metrostudy. In the case of the New American Home site, "being able to pick that [land] up for that price was a steal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lots are carved into the side of a mountain, with views of the desert and strip. Mr. Anderson purchased the land via a short sale after the previous owner, Alpha Land Development, saw the project fall into distress in 2009. "It was pretty much a traumatic thing for all of us," said Leslie Davis, project coordinator of the now-defunct company. "That was pretty much our baby."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas was a poster child for the housing bust: Overconstruction and lax lending gave way to plunging home values and rampant foreclosures. Home prices tumbled nearly 60% from the April 2006 peak until the December 2011 trough, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate data and analytics firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like the rest of the nation, the city's real-estate market appears to have hit bottom. The area's median single-family sales price in December was $185,000, up 24% from the prior year, according to the <span class="companylink">Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors</span>. Supply is also tight: About 13,000 homes were for sale in December, down nearly 9% from the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end market, Mr. Anderson's focus, has been particularly brisk. Some 343 homes sold for $1 million or more in Southern Nevada last year, the highest count since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When high-end inventory comes on the market, it gets eaten pretty quickly," said Rick Hildreth, a senior adviser with land brokerage Land Advisors Organization. With Las Vegas land prices doubling in the past year, Mr. Hildreth says people who purchased land several years ago now appear savvy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New American Home has been a highlight of IBS, one of the nation's largest business trade shows, since the first one was built in Houston in 1984, said Tucker Bernard, a director with the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, which hosts IBS.

</div><div class="author">Nirmala Menon </div><div>462 words</div><div>5 February 2014</div><div>05:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA—Canadian building permits fell unexpectedly in December as planned construction of multi-family dwellings--including condominiums and apartments--plunged the most in a year, underscoring a cooling in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits shrank for the second consecutive month, falling 4.1% to 6.48 billion Canadian dollars ($5.85 billion), following a revised 6.6% decline in November, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus call was for a 1.5% rebound in December from the originally estimated 6.7% drop the previous month, according to a report from <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall value of building permits for all of 2013 fell 0.1% to C$80.8 billion, the first decline since the 2009 recession when permits shrank 13.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential permits were down for a second straight month, falling 9.3% to C$3.70 billion, the lowest level since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was driven entirely by multi-family dwellings, which plummeted 21.9%--the largest magnitude since December 2012--to a nine-month low of C$1.47 billion. Most of the decline occurred in British Columbia, Ontario and Alberta, the statistical agency said. Single-family permits rose 1.5% to C$2.23 billion, the third increase in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the housing market, and particularly the condo sector in major cities, had been a source of concern for policymakers in recent years, prompting the federal government to tighten mortgage insurance rules in mid-2012 for the fourth time in as many years. That led to a slowing in the market, but as bond yields rose last summer on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve was about to scale back its bond-buying program, buyers rushed to purchase homes to take advantage of mortgage rates that they had locked in at lower rates. But data since then have shown the market is again slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the cooling, the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> said in a report this week that average house prices are about 10% more than justified by fundamentals, with most of the gap coming from Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across Canada, municipalities approved construction of 15,565 new residential buildings in December, a decline of 14.2% from November, as the number of multi-family dwellings plunged 21.3%. The number of single-family homes were down 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the non-residential sector, commercial permits plunged 33.5% to C$1.26 billion, mainly from lower planned construction of office buildings in Ontario and recreational facilities and retail stores in British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional permits more than doubled to C$939 million, while industrial permits jumped 34.9% to C$576 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners spent $130 billion on remodeling projects last year, according to data released Monday by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> . That was up 3.1% from 2012 and was the largest amount of home-remodeling spending since 2007, the year that the housing downturn began. Permits for remodeling jobs in the U.S. rose 5.1% last year from 2012, the largest increase since 2010 when the figures began their rebound from a 10-year low, according to permit-tracking company BuildFax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Bass, a retired museum manager, and Lisette Voyatzis, an attorney, decided to remodel their 2,000-square-foot home in Arlington, Va., rather than endure what they deemed the hassle of buying a new home. The project, which started last June, includes an expansion of their kitchen, the addition of a guest room and bathroom on the first floor and an expansion of the master suite on the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple purchased the home in 2008 for more than $1 million. Although Mr. Bass says he hasn't checked the home's value since then, real estate website Zillow said the median value of homes in the couple's ZIP Code have increased by 14% in the past two years. The couple landed a home-equity loan to cover roughly a third of the renovation's estimated cost of $400,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, we envision staying in this house for a number of years," Mr. Bass said. "We thought about what we're putting into the house increasing its value. But we're not at all thinking of selling. It just seemed like too much to go through buying and selling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising spending on remodeling is in contrast to recent signs of slowing in new-home construction activity, indicating that a growing number of consumers have decided that upgrading their home might be a better investment than buying a new one. Other factors at play include the limited inventory of existing homes and rising home values, which have made it easier for homeowners to finance their remodeling projects by borrowing against their equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-equity lending—which sank to its lowest level of the past 10 years in 2010—jumped 18% last year to $123.4 billion, according to estimates by Moody's Analytics. That increased lending stems mostly from rising home values, which created more equity for many homeowners and lifted some who previously owed more than their home was worth, into positive territory. According to real estate data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> , two-thirds of all U.S. homeowners had at least 20% equity in their homes as of last year's third quarter, up from 53.2% two years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If home prices are going up and people have more equity in their home, things like remodeling and refurbishment will do well, because it's effectively the way of playing the reinvestment game," said Joseph LaVorgna , chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank AG .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased remodeling activity comes as thousands of contractors and tradesmen are expected to convene in Las Vegas this week at two trade shows geared to the remodeling and home-building industry, the International Builder Show and the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show. The combined attendance is expected to exceed 80,000, the highest since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From 2010 to 2013 is the difference between night and day," said Gary Drake, chief executive of Drake General Contractor Inc., a Los Angeles remodeling company that says it posted a 30% increase in revenue last year to $4 million. "The phone is ringing more. Old clients are calling me. Architects are offering me work. I'm actually turning down work now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in remodeling projects has revved up sales for a variety of home-improvement companies, from retailers such as <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span> . to paint company <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams Co</span> ., and local contractors who install everything from granite countertops to carpeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Grosswendt, a builder and renovator of high-end homes in the Los Angeles area, said revenue and staff at his company, All Coast Construction, were nearly halved during the downturn to as low as $10 million and 25 workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market recovered in 2013, Mr. Grosswendt's revenue climbed to $15 million. These days he's turning down work while keeping his staff at 25 and spending more time on fewer projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppliers are cashing in, too. <span class="companylink">Masco Corporation</span> , owner of brands including KraftMaid cabinets, Behr paints and Delta faucets, posted $2.2 billion in sales in the third quarter, up 12% from a year earlier partly on strong sales of windows and cabinets. Residential remodeling projects typically account for roughly three-quarters of <span class="companylink">Masco</span> 's sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Mohawk Industries</span> , a global manufacturer of tile, carpet and flooring, saw U.S. sales of its product lines decline by 30% to 40% during the downturn. In 2013, Mohawk posted quarterly gains, such as a 12% increase in sales of ceramic tile in the U.S. and a 3% boost in carpet sales, due at least in part to more remodeling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those year-over-year gains for our products for remodeling are the first we have seen in the past six years," said Frank Boykin , Mohawk's chief financial officer. "This is an indication of the potential pent-up demand in the remodel market."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A penthouse in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood has closed for $50.9 million, setting a record for the most expensive home sale downtown, according to listing agent Vickey Barron of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Called Penthouse One, the 5,955-square-foot, five-bedroom, 5½-bath apartment takes up the 24th floor of Walker Tower, an Art Deco office building converted to condos by JDS Development Group and Property Markets Group. It has a private south-facing terrace and floor-to-ceiling windows on all four sides, allowing views of the Statue of Liberty, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, Ms. Barron said. The unit also has nearly 13-foot-high coffered ceilings and three wood-burning fireplaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was listed in September for $55 million, and went into contract less than a month later, said Ms. Barron, who represented the buyer and seller. The all-cash deal closed last week, said Elliott Joseph, a principal at Property Markets Group. Mr. Joseph and Ms. Barron said they couldn't disclose the identity of the buyer, but Ms. Barron said the purchaser "was in the penthouse less than five minutes and said, 'I'll take it.'" According to records, the largest prior sale south of 34th street in Manhattan was a penthouse at 18 Gramercy Park South that sold for $42 million in August 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walker Tower was designed by architect Ralph Walker and completed in 1929 as an office for New York Telephone. The developers bought the building in 2009 from Verizon for $25.25 million, according to public records, and conducted an extensive renovation. The only other unit available in the 47-unit building is Penthouse Two, on the 23rd floor, which is listed for $47.5 million, Mr. Joseph said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 6,515 square feet, Penthouse Two is larger than Penthouse One, but the top floor fetches a premium, Mr. Joseph said. Still, he said if the market stays strong, when Penthouse Two sells "we might break our own record."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living in "the Crescent House," a contemporary home by noted architectural designer Wallace Cunningham, is "kind of an adventure," said owner Esther Fischer, who has listed the Encinitas, Calif., house for $11.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cunningham designed the waterfront home in 2000 for Ms. Fischer and her late husband, San Diego real-estate developer Arnold "Bud" Fischer. Made of concrete, steel and glass, the 6,500-square-foot home has four bedrooms, and four full and two half bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When visitors enter the home, the first thing they see is an infinity pool shaped like a crescent moon—hence the home's name, Ms. Fischer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool wraps around a circular terrace, which is accessed by a curved ramp, Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home's design was inspired by the moon and the views from the home's perch on a sandstone bluff some 80 feet above the ocean, Mr. Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the ocean-facing side of the house, he said, is floor-to-ceiling glass intended to maximize light and water views. In fact, Mr. Cunningham said he "couldn't bear" to build a wall in the living room, where Ms. Fischer wanted to hang a painting by contemporary artist Squeak Carnwath. Instead, they suspended the piece on cables in front of the glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home also has terraces off the living room, office and master bedroom. There is an elevator, a two-car garage and a gym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fischers moved into the house in 2003. Mr. Fischer died last year, and his wife said she is selling because the property is now "a lot of house for me." Still, "it makes me very sad to leave."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agent is Douglas Harwood of Coldwell Banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Harper's job as chief executive of California's Del Mar racetrack involves lots of entertaining: The summer racing season is "a seven-week long party," Mr. Harper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when he and his wife, Barbara, set out to build their house in the so-called Del Mar Beach Colony, about 20 miles north of San Diego, they made sure there was plenty of space for parties. The 4,700-square-foot, five-bedroom, five-bathroom oceanfront home, now on the market for $25 million with Brian Pasco of Coldwell Banker, can accommodate some 200 guests, Ms. Harper said—especially when there is a dance floor set up on the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is on about 60 feet of waterfront, Mr. Harper said. It has a balcony on the second floor and five wood-burning fireplaces, including one in an outdoor seating area. There is also an attached studio apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bing Crosby founded the Del Mar racetrack in 1934, and since then it has been known as "a playground of Hollywood," said Mr. Harper. For years, TV personalities Merv Griffin and Eva Gabor were visitors at his home, he said. Mr. Harper's grandfather was filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, and as a child Mr. Harper appeared in several movies, including as a slave in "the Ten Commandments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Del Mar Beach Colony developed in the 1930s as a spot for celebrities to buy or rent homes during the racing season, Mr. Harper said. The Harpers bought their home in 1970 for about $170,000, he said. The Harpers initially used an existing bungalow as a summer home. But in the 1980s they removed the house and built the current structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple is selling because Mr. Harper, 70, is "backing off a little bit" from his responsibilities at the racetrack, though he said he isn't quite ready for retirement. The couple wants to spend more time at their Arizona ranch, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Musician John Mayer has sold his 2,063-square-foot downtown Manhattan condo to an undisclosed buyer for $3.91 million, according to public records. The singer-songwriter had listed the two-bedroom, 2 ½-bathroom Soho apartment for $3.895 million in October with Brown Harris Stevens. According to the records, Mr. Mayer purchased the condo for $2.17 million in 2005. The sale was previously reported by the Real Deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold medal-winning figure skater Evan Lysacek bought a two-bedroom condo in Chicago for $850,000. The 1,600-square-foot unit is on the 45th floor of a high-rise just off North Michigan Avenue, according to Julie Busby of Belgravia Realty Group, who represented Mr. Lysacek. The purchase included a deeded indoor parking spot. Mr. Lysacek won a gold medal in the 2010 Olympics. He is not competing in the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi due to injury. The deal was previously reported by the <span class="companylink">Chicago Tribune</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a deal expected to close for more than $90 million, the government of Qatar is in contract to buy a Manhattan townhouse on East 64th Street to use as a New York consulate. <span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span>'s Carrie Chiang, who represented the seller, said when the deal closes in April, it will set a record for the most expensive townhouse sold in Manhattan. Here are some other things $90 million buys:</p>

</div><div class="author">Nick Timiraos  </div><div>944 words</div><div>30 January 2014</div><div>09:44</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, already showing signs of slowing after a big jump in mortgage rates last summer, cooled further at the end of last year, according to economic reports and the latest quarterly results from several big home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index measuring contracts to buy existing homes fell 8.7% in December from November to its lowest level in more than two years, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Pending sales stood 8.8% below the year-earlier level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, housing construction's contribution to gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, declined during the fourth quarter, subtracting one-third of a percentage point from economic growth. That was the first such decline in more than three years, according to the Commerce Department report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists blamed the dip in sales and construction on cold winter weather. "The drop was inconsistent with the fundamentals, and you'll see a snapback in the current quarter," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others aren't so sure and are questioning whether the recent pullback will be temporary or the beginning of slower growth. "Weather was a contributing factor but not the only thing here, especially in the West," where contract activity dropped 16% from a year earlier, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most observers agree that one big factor behind the slowdown in housing activity is rising prices, which were up nearly 24% in November from March 2012, when the market bottomed, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price index. The price gains have been fueled largely by low supplies of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record low interest rates two years ago also unleashed pent-up demand from traditional buyers, and many found themselves in competition with investors who had been actively buying up cheap foreclosures. The frenzy appeared to subside last summer, however, after mortgage rates jumped by nearly a full percentage point, to around 4.5% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan in June, from 3.5% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real-estate agents have blamed the sales slowdown on inventory shortages. "You could sell more if there was more product available," said Donna Evers, chief executive of real-estate brokerage Evers &amp; Co. in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales have slowed recently even in markets where inventories are now rising. Housing markets in coastal California, where prices have posted double-digit gains over the past year, "have gotten out over their skis," said Mr. Humphries. "It's not that [buyers] can't find homes to buy. It's that they don't want to buy them at the prices being offered," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A related concern is that consumers' balance sheets are too weak, and that the problem will only worsen as interest rates and prices climb. Given the slow pace of wage growth, "it is difficult to find sustainable support for the rapid growth in home prices across much of the country," said Stefan Hilts, a director at <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> in New York, in a report released Thursday. Mr. Hilts said that home-price growth has been "excessive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More jobs, and ideally better-paying jobs, will be critical in driving housing demand to peak levels," said Richard Dugas Jr., chief executive of home builder <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., on an earnings call Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the related question of why new-home construction hasn't ramped up faster. Labor, land, and supply costs have also been harder to manage as builders rebuild their supply chains, and it has been difficult for small builders to obtain loans. As a result, builders have focused on getting higher prices rather than higher sales volumes, said Brad Hunter, chief economist for Metrostudy, a division of <span class="companylink">Hanley Wood LLC</span> that tracks U.S. home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus on building more expensive homes pushed the average price of newly built homes to an all-time high of $320,900 last year, up 9.8% from 2012, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. Last year's figure exceeded the previous high of $313,600 in 2007, though sales last year were nearly half of what they were in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those heady price increases showed up in the fourth-quarter results reported by three national builders on Thursday. Pulte, <span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. posted big revenue gains for the quarter due mostly to price increases, but those gains came at the expense of sales volumes. The number of new orders for Pulte declined 18% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. <span class="companylink">Beazer</span>'s fell by 4% Ryland's, by 4.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists expect construction to pick up this year as builders shift to focusing more on production volume now that price increases largely have played out. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> predicts housing starts will increase roughly 24.1% this year to 1.15 million units, while <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economists estimate 1.25 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, move-up buyers are representing an increasingly larger portion of a much-reduced market for new homes. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., the largest U.S. builder by number of home sales, reported Tuesday that first-time buyers accounted for 41% of the mortgages it originated in its quarter ended Dec. 31, down from 50% a year earlier. Move-up buyers generally have the financial wherewithal to qualify for mortgages under stricter guidelines, and the rising equity in their homes last year gave them firepower to consider buying new ones.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>.'s fourth-quarter earnings surged as the home builder reported higher sales, helped by a jump in average selling price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one the nation's largest builders, Pulte's sales are typically considered to be a strong barometer for the sector because the company constructs everything from entry-level homes to units for retirees nationwide. Builders have benefited from a low supply of existing-home inventory in recent periods, though the industry experienced weak demand in the latest period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourth-quarter results showed the continued benefit of the company's value creation initiatives, as well as benefits from the ongoing recovery in U.S. housing, said Chief Executive Richard Dugas Jr., adding that gross margin was the highest margin the company has achieved since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte's new orders were down 18% from a year earlier. Closings, meanwhile, fell 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Pulte reported a profit of $220.1 million, or 57 cents a share, up from $58.7 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-ago period included charges of $73 million, or 19 cents per share, resulting from mortgage and debt-repurchase charges, partially offset by tax benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total revenues rose 5.6% to $1.66 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast earnings of 44 cents a share on revenue of $1.68 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building cost of revenue edged down 0.9%. Home sale gross margin rose 610 basis points to 23.2%. The average selling price rose 13% to $325,000. </p>

</div><div class="author">Kwanwoo Jun </div><div>631 words</div><div>28 January 2014</div><div>23:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEOUL—South Korea's industrial output grew surprisingly strongly last month, reflecting robust demand from the U.S. and other advanced economies as well as China, Korea's largest export market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea's factory output increased 3.4% in December from the previous month—the biggest gain since June 2009—blowing past an expected rise of 0.5% in a Wall Street Journal poll of economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released Wednesday supported the upbeat picture of the Korean economy, a key barometer of global trade and growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's current account, the broadest measure of trade with the rest of the world, grew to a surplus of $6.43 billion in December from $6.03 billion a month earlier. For the whole of 2013, South Korea posted a record $70.73 billion surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the latest set of figures give further support to the view that South Korea's key export markets are on a sustained recovery track. Exports account for just under half of South Korea's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The main factor behind the large [current account] surplus remains the strength in exports, as the firming global backdrop continues to support demand for Korean goods," said <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Wai Ho Leong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As demand in the U.S. and Europe continues to firm, we expect Korean exports to continue to perform well over the coming year," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is in its firmest period of recovery since the 2008 global financial crisis. The U.S. jobless rate has fallen to 6.7% as of December compared with a peak of 10% in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European economy is also picking up, with the United Kingdom economy expected to have grown 1.9% in 2013, according to its statistics agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly important to South Korea is the health of the Chinese economy, which absorbs a quarter of total shipments from South Korea. Concerns about China were increased by a recent survey that pointed toward a slow in activity in China's factory sector for the first time in six months in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong factory production in South Korea is also an encouraging sign for Chinese growth because Korea increasingly ships parts for assembly in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade data for December, released earlier this month, showed South Korean exports to the U.S. rose 13.2% from a year earlier, while shipments to the EU gained 1.8%. South Korean exports to China increased 8.3% on the year in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By product, South Korean shipments of memory chips increased by 20.1% on the year in December because of growing demand from the U.S., Bank of Korea data showed. Exports of cars also surged 14.5% last month on rising demand, especially from the U.S., the Middle East and the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. Shipments of machinery jumped 18.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Korea is home to global manufacturers of vehicles, ships, mobile handsets, semiconductors, petrochemicals and electronics goods shipped to various markets of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nomura economist Kwon Young-sun said the robust output and current account data in December would likely lead South Korea's growth momentum into the first quarter of 2014, also helped by signs of a property market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect pent-up demand to materialize further, supported by government measures to increase social welfare spending and boost the property market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the whole of 2013, the South Korean economy expanded 2.8%, in a pickup from a three-year low of 2% growth in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOK has said the economy will continue to pick up through this year, helped by an international recovery, forecasting growth of 3.8% for 2014 and 4% for 2015.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales ended 2013 on a weak note amid unusually cold weather, renewing concerns about the housing industry's rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes fell 7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 414,000 in December, from 445,000 in November, the Commerce Department said Monday. November's figure was revised down by 19,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December sales came in below the 455,000 median annual pace forecast by 15 analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and were at their lowest level since the summer, when rising mortgage rates undermined demand. Rates jumped in response to Federal Reserve plans to start dialing back a bond-buying program designed to keep borrowing costs low. Home sales dipped to a 373,000 annual pace in July but then recovered in the following months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final figures for 2013 showed housing sales running at less than half the pace of the years even before the housing boom last decade led to a surge in construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report was the latest in a string of disappointing releases economists attribute to last month's cold and stormy weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report "will keep alive the debate over whether the recovery in home sales will get back on track soon," said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging demand for housing, prompted by steady job gains and historically low interest rates, has been an important driver of the economic recovery. But new-home building has run ahead of sales in recent months. "The sales pace will need to pick back up in coming months," said Ted Wieseman, an economist at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect interest rates to rise this year as the economic recovery strengthens and the Fed tries to wind down its bond-buying program. Fed officials are expected to announce another reduction in the purchases to $65 billion a month from the current $75 billion after their two-day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.46% in December, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That was almost a percentage point higher than rates in early May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home in December was $270,200, up 4.6% from a year earlier and the highest level since April. That is a sign of strong demand for housing but is also another factor undermining affordability in many of the nation's hottest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some recent data have shown prospective buyers adapting to higher prices and mortgage rates. A gauge of pending sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of transactions, showed an uptick after falling off in the middle part of the year. New-home construction also has picked up after a summer lull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> last week said 5.09 million existing homes were sold in 2013. That was up 9% from 2012 and the best annual performance since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group forecast that existing-home sales will be at about the same level this year. But it said the stock of new homes needs to increase to ease supply shortages and temper rapid price gains. Many economists predict that strong demand for housing will prompt an acceleration in home-building activity in the year ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices continued to rise solidly in November, according to a home price report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 13.8% in the year ended in November, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price report. The 20-city price index increased 13.7%, close to the 13.8% advance expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two indexes indicate home prices are back to levels seen in mid-2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound in home prices has been a plus for the economy since higher values support new-home construction and creates wealth for homeowners that can then be spent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, both the 10-city and 20-city indexes declined 0.1% in November over October. Seasonally adjusted, the gain for both composites each increased 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, the Dallas home price index reached a record high and posted its highest annual return of 9.9% since the data's inception in 2000. Chicago also stood out with a yearly gain of 11%, its highest since December 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices continue to rise despite last May's jump in mortgage interest rates," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Blitzer was cautious about 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While housing will make further contributions to the economy in 2014, the pace of price gains is likely to slow during the year," he said. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Britain's economic recovery ebbed in the final three months of 2013, a slight slowdown that could strengthen policy makers' resolve to keep stimulus flowing to encourage further growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said Tuesday output in the economy grew 0.7% between October and December, down from a 0.8% expansion rate in the two previous quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in annualized terms in the fourth quarter was 2.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fall in construction output in November was largely to blame for the slowdown, the statistics office said, estimating output in that sector fell by 0.3% during the quarter overall. Other sectors of the economy grew steadily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ONS didn't make any estimate for the likely impact of flooding that hit parts of the U.K. at the end of December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling fell against both the dollar and the euro in the minutes after the data were released, before recovering. Prices of <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> bonds edged lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data matched economists' forecasts in a Wall Street Journal poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth is widely expected to accelerate in 2014. The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> earlier this month predicted growth of 2.4% over the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew 1.9% in 2013 as a whole, its fastest rate of growth since 2007 and likely one of the best performances among developed nations. Other countries have yet to release growth figures for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy began a strong recovery at the start of 2013 after sputtering since 2010, when the coalition government took power with a policy of fiscal consolidation meant to address the huge debts the U.K. had racked up, partly as a consequence of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Osborne, the U.K.'s finance chief, welcomed the ONS figures but said the government cannot back away from its plan to curb benefits and other forms of government spending, while cutting taxes for businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is more evidence that our long-term economic plan is working," Mr. Osborne said in a statement. "But the job is not done, and it is clear that the biggest risk now to the recovery would be abandoning the plan that's delivering jobs and a brighter economic future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britons will go to the polls in the spring of 2015. The opposition Labour Party says policy should change to help boost workers' incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have now seen four successive quarters of significant growth and the economy does seem to be improving more consistently," Joe Grice, the statistics office's chief economic adviser, said of Tuesday's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. economic output has yet to recover fully from a steep recession in 2009, however, remaining 1.3% below the precrisis peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth-quarter growth rate failed to match <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> officials' predictions for the economy to accelerate further during the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fact is likely to underpin policy makers' commitment to keep monetary policy loose, despite the recovery seen to date and widespread predictions of further growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials on the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee have said they won't consider tightening policy even after the U.K.'s unemployment rate falls below a 7% threshold they established in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless rate fell to 7.1% in the three months through November, the latest figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth-quarter growth disappointment "may help to quell murmurs of some support among committee members for an interest-rate rise sooner rather than later," said Martin Beck, economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, conditions are in place for stronger growth in gross domestic product next year, he said. "With rising real incomes set to provide stronger support for household spending and investment set to pick up, we expect GDP to expand by a healthy 3% in 2014."</p>

</div><div class="author">Conor Dougherty </div><div>1053 words</div><div>27 January 2014</div><div>15:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO—Faced with a chronic housing shortage that is getting worse and fueling social tensions, politicians here want to speed up the pace of new residential construction. But that's a tall order in a city where a daunting approval process and stiff local opposition can turn even a small project into a yearslong battle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers are finding jobs by the bucketful in San Francisco, but housing supply hasn't kept pace. About 4,000 housing units have been added in the past three years, for roughly 10,000 new households, according to the city planning department. This imbalance has fueled what already was one of the nation's most expensive cities: Rents are up 17% over the past three years, and an index of San Francisco home prices from Black Knight Financial Services rose 14.5% in November from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee unveiled a plan to add 30,000 new housing units over the next six years—a majority of which would be set aside as affordable housing for families with incomes that are 80% to 150% of the city's median income. The plan would include building affordable housing on city-owned properties, hiring more staff to speed along permitting for new construction, and exploring affordable-housing incentives for developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing shortage is "a crisis of our own making," Mr. Lee said in a state of the city address, which was held at a new-home development in the city's economically depressed Bayview neighborhood. That sentiment is echoed by real-estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many elements of [Mr. Lee's plan] that will work, but it will take time," said Oz Erickson, chairman of Emerald Fund Inc., a local developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing supply will rise sharply in 2014—there are about 6,000 units under construction—but the messy reality behind Mr. Lee's plan is that any sustained boost in construction would require the city to overcome a slew of neighborhood and political forces that are aligned against building anything in a hurry, or in certain areas. While neighborhoods surrounding downtown are draped in new buildings and cranes, much of the city is a suburban-like expanse of single-family homes and neighbors who want to keep it that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the city's powerful tenant-rights and affordable-housing advocates don't think building alone is the answer. Peter Cohen, co-director of Council of Community Housing Organizations, would prefer less market-rate housing and more protections for renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his speech, Mr. Lee—a lawyer who began his political career as a housing-rights advocate—complained that the city wants it both ways. "We want more money for affordable housing, but too often we oppose or scale back the very projects that generate those funds," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's enviable problem is that it is a desirable city with tons of new jobs. Over the past three years, the city saw its job tally grow 10%—a little more than double the national pace in that period. The nation hasn't passed its prerecession job peak, but San Francisco blew past that milestone in 2012—then added 2.7% more jobs in 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by some measures, San Francisco is the worst U.S. city to be a middle-class home buyer. Just 14% of homes in the metro area are attainable to those making the area median income, the lowest percentage in the nation, according to research from Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, it would be difficult for San Francisco to add housing at the same pace as younger cities, and it is a hilly peninsula on just 49 square miles. But data suggest the city is even lagging behind its peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of an urban-policy nonprofit called SPUR, notes the city added about 1,500 units each year over the past two decades. That compares with about 3,000 units annually in Seattle, which has similar topography and has also seen a technology boom. He derived his figures from building data from both cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activists, meanwhile, are directing their furor toward the booming technology sector and what they see as symbols of a growing economic gap. On several occasions, including last week, protesters have blocked and sometimes vandalized the private buses that shuttle San Francisco-based tech workers to their corporate campuses in the Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carsten Schertzer, a 20-year-old photographer who makes about $70,000 a year, is among those having trouble finding a home. Mr. Schertzer is preparing to move to San Francisco from Los Angeles to start a new job in February, but after searching for an apartment, he and his fiancée have lowered their sights to simply finding a room. "Renting an apartment in a decent part of town is impossible," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's plodding construction pace has added to the shortage. In most major cities, there are few legislative or permitting hurdles to developments that don't require major zoning changes. Here, even projects with a handful of units are subject to a legislative and appeals process that can take years—raising the cost of housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Erickson, the developer, estimates it costs $650,000 to build an 800-square-foot unit in a midrise building, and as much as $100,000 of that can be chalked up to the elongated pace of construction. "Every single [building] permit is subject to discretionary review," Mr. Erickson said. Because of that process, he said, "anybody can fight" any development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supervisor Scott Wiener, whose district includes many transit-heavy neighborhoods that are popular with young technology workers, has pushed to cut down on delays tied to the appeals process. His proposal to curb the city's environmental-appeals process to 30 days after approval was signed into law last July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I'm trying to do is convey to people that it's not good enough to be upset and to think that if we jump up and down prices will come down," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Chinese Property Firms' Junk Bonds Started 2014 Fast but Have Soured</span>
</div><div class="author">Fiona Law </div><div>906 words</div><div>27 January 2014</div><div>01:11</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese issuers of junk bonds got off to a fast start in 2014, but concerns about weakening economic growth and the likelihood of a high-profile loan default are putting investors off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese real-estate developers in particular opened up a wide lead on the Asian pack in terms of high-yield bond issuance in advance of the Year of the Horse, but now they are leading the way regionally in a broader emerging-market selloff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese property developers raised a combined $4.55 billion by issuing junk, or non-investment-grade, bonds in the first three weeks of the year, accounting for 11 of 12 such issues in Asia outside Japan, according to data provider Dealogic. That is not far off the record pace set in the same period last year, when Chinese companies issued $5.87 billion in junk bonds. Meantime, total junk bonds for Asia, excluding Japan, shrank 40% to $4.77 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese firms sought to extend the pattern, set over the past two years of tapping bond buyers who were on the hunt for higher yields in growth markets against a backdrop of ultralow interest rates globally amid central banks' loose monetary policy. But unlike last year, when bond prices soared, the new debt has turned sour immediately after issuance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KWG Property Holding Ltd</span>., a large developer, saw its five-year bond fall roughly 2% from its issue price, while notes from <span class="companylink">CIFI Holdings (Group) Co</span>., a smaller player, fell around 5% within a couple days of its issuance. Bond prices of peers who issued debt with investment-grade ratings also softened: <span class="companylink">China Overseas Grand Oceans Group Ltd</span>.'s five-year bond, for example, fell by around 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously Asia cannot escape from global emerging-market weakness, despite the fact that most Asian countries are not battling the same level of currency volatility or political instability seen in some other emerging regions," said Mark Reade, credit desk analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. "Chinese high-yield bonds have been harder-hit than their investment-grade counterparts as tight onshore liquidity conditions have stoked concerns about a deluge of offshore high-yield supply, not to mention rising refinancing risk among smaller, weaker corporates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have veered sharply away from risky assets in global emerging markets, with Argentina's peso and Turkey's lira having taken serious knocks last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In China, property bonds started getting squeezed after a weaker-than-expected initial reading on manufacturing activity last week, exacerbated by mounting pressure that could lead to an unprecedented default on a trust product sold by <span class="companylink">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd</span>. Bond prices are off their their lows since news emerged Monday that China Credit Trust Co., the Chinese lender behind a troubled $500 million investment product, appeared to have found a way to pay back investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate developers in the country needing funds to acquire land or build projects but unable to secure loans or raise cash onshore given the government's effort to rein in a housing bubble, tend to tap offshore markets for funding when they are favored by foreign investors. Housing prices in China picked up modestly in December compared with November, according to the latest data, and most property firms still see healthy cash flow amid robust contract sales, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> warns that these property firms are vulnerable to tighter credit conditions in the domestic market and slower sales growth. The Wall Street bank recommends reducing exposure to Chinese high-yield bonds in favor of higher-rated issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of just how shaky the country's debt market has become, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co.—one of China's biggest real-estate players, which has an investment-grade rating—sold a $600 million 10-year bond with 7.25% yield, even higher than rates offered on some junk bonds. The company is eager to secure funding ahead of any spike in global interest rates, a person close to the deal said. Higher rates are widely anticipated as the U.S. Federal Reservescales back its bond-buying program, a process known as "tapering."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is really choppy these days," with the preponderance of news stories weighing on market sentiment, said Gordon Ip, a fixed-income portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Value Partners Group Ltd</span>., which manages $10.5 billion of assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Value Partners</span> didn't participate in the recent Chinese junk-bond issues, as "we think their pricings were too expensive" given the respective companies' fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment, he said, adding that he is parking some of his funds in more "defensive" assets, such as bonds issued by banks for capital replenishment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reduced appetite for junk bonds, both in China and in the rest of Asia, is part of a "macro theme that developed markets continue to fare better than emerging markets," said Arthur Lau at <span class="companylink">PineBridge Investments</span>, which manages $69.1 billion of assets globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Funds, especially retail funds, are pulling out from emerging markets, especially those invested in marginal credit such as Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia and India, which are vulnerable to U.S. tapering," he said. "So far this year, though, we still see institutional funds continuing to flow into Asia, but at a much slower pace. We are more selective in tapping junk bonds, and wouldn't buy them across the board."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath   </div><div>421 words</div><div>24 January 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes finished 2013 at their highest level in seven years, but a slowdown in recent months suggests the market is cooling after two years of strong gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 1% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.87 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. But that was the first increase since July and the second-weakest month of the year, behind November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said 5.09 million existing homes were sold throughout 2013 -- up 9% from 2012 and the highest level of sales since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though many economists expect the housing market's improvement to continue, last year's growth rate is unlikely to be maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace is "not sustainable," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. "With mortgage rates likely to move up this year, sales and price gains will likely be about half of what we saw last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market remains low, at a 4.6-month supply compared with the six-month supply that is considered healthy. Tight inventories are putting upward pressure on prices, and the median existing-home price rose to $198,000 in December, up 9.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price gains also reflect fewer homes sold at a discount through short sales and foreclosures. Conventional sales rose 12% last year while distressed sales fell by about a third, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at real-estate website Tulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Conventional sales are picking up the slack and that shift is positive for the housing recovery," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes had trended up from early 2011 until last summer, when rising prices, limited supply and higher mortgage rates -- which make monthly payments more expensive -- undercut demand. Because it typically takes one or two months for a buyer to close on a home, December's sales data reflect offers made in October and November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of November, the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 4.29%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> -- almost a percentage point higher than rates in early May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Falling affordability is hindering buying activity," said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. Mr. Yun expects 2014 sales to hold flat compared with last year and foresees mortgage rates reaching 5.3% by the end of the year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>733 words</div><div>24 January 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M12</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would you trust a dual agent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dual agency occurs when the same brokerage firm -- and sometimes the same real-estate agent -- represents both the buyer and the seller in the same transaction. Dual agency can increase or reduce a house's sale price, depending on the timing, says Bennie Waller, professor of finance and real estate at <span class="companylink">Longwood University</span> in Farmville, Va., who studied dual agency in home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dual-agency sales that occur in the first 30 days of the listing contract sell for roughly an 18% premium because agents may be able to more efficiently match the property with the right buyer if they search within their own network, Prof. Waller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, that information advantage diminishes as other agents learn more about the seller and property, says Raymond Brastow, professor of economics at <span class="companylink">Longwood University</span>, who co-wrote the study. By the end of the listing contract, the agent's priority is getting the property sold before the contract expires. Dual-agency sales during the last 30 days of the listing contract sell for roughly a 6% discount, or $9,300 less. Overall, a dual-agency representation reduces sale prices by about 1.7%, according to the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents have a lot to gain from dual agency. The seller typically pays 5% to 6% of the sale price as commission, which is split between the buyer's agent and seller's agent. Thus, agents have an incentive to represent both sides of the transaction and earn the entire commission, Prof. Waller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may also mean an agent might encourage sellers to accept a lower price for a home to get the double commission, says Prof. Brastow. "You have the interest of the buyer, the seller and the agent, and it's unlikely all three will coincide, especially in respect to price. They can't," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Waller and Prof. Brastow examined 12,549 transactions between January 2000 and June 2009 in a central Virginia multiple-listing service. They analyzed which transactions were dual agency or non-dual agency and looked at effects on sale price and time on the market. The study, "Dual Agency Representation: Incentive Conflicts or Efficiencies?" was published in the Journal of Real Estate Research in June 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many states allow true dual-agency relationships, in which the agent represents, and has a fiduciary duty to, both the buyer and seller. Some states, however, have modified versions of dual agency, such as letting transaction agents act only as deal facilitators, says Ilona Bray, real-estate editor for Nolo, a publisher of consumer legal guides in Berkeley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Ms. Bray warns against dual agency. "A buyer and a seller are in very different parts of the transactions. Their interests are different," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some agents say dual agency is more efficient and effective. Sometimes they will accept a lower commission from the seller. Also, both sides benefit from having one point of contact, says Jud Henderson of Callaway Henderson Sotheby's International Realty in Princeton, N.J., who was a dual agent in three transactions last year. "It can work to disarm the process, cut out the politics and just focus on the terms of the transaction," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, he received two offers for a $1.995 million listing from one of his buyers and another agent's buyer. The seller ended up selling the property for just under the asking price to Mr. Henderson's buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double Duty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers analyzed house sales in which a broker represented buyer and seller. The study found:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Dual-agency sales in the first 30 days of a listing contract sell for a premium of about 18%, or $28,800 more for the average house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Dual-agency sales in the last 30 days of a listing contract sell at about a 6% discount, or $9,300 less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Overall, dual agency reduces home price by about 1.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Dual-agency sales occur 55.1% more quickly than non-dual agency sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- About 32% of all transactions are dual-agency transactions.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor   </div><div>891 words</div><div>24 January 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chicago's Hyde Park, a meticulously restored, 11-bedroom mansion sold this past spring for $3.75 million after about 1 1/2 months on the market. The sale, to an all-cash buyer, was the highest home sale ever recorded on the South Side, according to listing agent Jan Smith of @properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside Atlanta, a 26,000-square-foot house modeled after Los Angeles's Playboy Mansion sold in a very different market. Listed in January for $3.85 million, it was repriced for less than $3 million and sold in September for $2.175 million. The high-end real-estate market in Atlanta is "still soft," says listing agent Jim Gibson, adding that the affluent suburb of Roswell, where the house is located, is faring better than lower-priced markets in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of luxury-home sales picked up steam in 2013, as wealthy home buyers returned after several years of sitting it out. But the recovery remains uneven, with some markets experiencing record-high prices while others are far below their boom-time levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 51 homes included in the 2013 House of the Year poll, 10 had sold or were in contract after being featured on WSJ.com, according to data compiled in early January. (All the homes in the poll were on the market at some point in 2013.) But nearly all sold for less than their asking prices. The Hyde Park mansion that sold for $3.75 million had been asking $4.9 million. Ms. Smith said it was difficult to price the home because there had been few comparable sales of houses of that size in the neighborhood. Owner Linda Heagy said the sale price was less than she and her husband had hoped, but they were reluctant to lose the deal. "We thought we could be sitting here two years from now and not have another bid this good," Ms. Heagy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially in areas where the real-estate market is very active, "there is a disconnect between reality and what the sellers expect," said Budge Huskey, president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate</span>. Despite strong demand from buyers, "you have to be realistic on pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the high-end home market has generally been outperforming the overall market. In the first three quarters of 2013, <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>'s luxury-home program saw its number of sales over $1 million jump 28% over the same period in 2012, said Mr. Huskey. That compares with growth of roughly 11% for the market as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end buyers are less likely to be affected by the still-tight financing market. And sellers tend to prefer all-cash deals, said Cheryl Loeffler of Premier Sotheby's International Realty in Sarasota, Fla. She listed a home on the barrier island of Longboat Key in January for $5.2 million. Just over a month later, the waterfront home sold to an all-cash buyer for $4.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup is pronounced in major coastal cities like Los Angeles, New York and Miami, said real-estate appraiser Jonathan Miller of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers in New York. In Los Angeles County, sales of houses costing $1 million or more jumped to 6,527 homes in 2013 from 4,821 the previous year, according to data from real-estate listings company Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Santiago Arana of Los Angeles-based brokerage the Agency listed Gary and Nili Ovsiowitz's home in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Palisades for $16.999 million. The Tuscan-style house found a buyer within a week, and closed in May for $15.35 million-- the highest price per square foot of the year for Pacific Palisades, Mr. Arana said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Pacific Palisades market is the exception. Prices are still "way off peak levels" in most areas of the country, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Paradise Valley, Ariz., "we're in a good, stable market but we're nowhere near where we used to be," said real-estate agent Jack Luciano of Walt Danley Realty. Mr. Luciano co-listed a home there for $5.75 million in August. It is now in escrow and slated to close in early February for "close to the asking price," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has sold twice since it was featured as The Wall Street Journal's House of the Day in January of 2013. Then-owners Greg and Ruth Burk, who had listed the home for $5.699 million, sold it to Mr. Luciano's client for $5.25 million in February, according to public records. The Burks had purchased it in 2010 for $2.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home is still worth less than it would have been at the market's peak: Mr. Luciano estimated that in 2006, it would likely have sold for about $11 million. The original owners had spent some $8 million building the home, Mr. Luciano said, then lost the property to the bank.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN—Irish home prices rose for the ninth successive month in December with Dublin leading the way, but doubts remain whether this points to a sustainable recovery of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government sees rising home prices—along with higher employment and tax revenue levels—as a key sign the country is recovering from the devastating banking crisis that erupted with the bursting of its property bubble over six years ago. The government exited its 2010 bailout last month and is once again tapping bond markets for funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countrywide, residential prices rose 0.3% in December and were 6.4% higher than in December 2012, the Central Statistics Office said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dublin, prices increased by 0.3% in December and were 15.7% higher than a year earlier. Outside of the capital, prices are still 0.4% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that a housing market recovery has started in the Irish capital, but that a low volume of mortgage lending suggest that any upturn will likely be slow and uneven. <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> projected this week that Irish price increases will slow to 3.5% this year, saying "tight lending" and high levels of household mortgage debt will weigh on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland's property price bubble was one of the world's largest, and recorded one of the largest drops. On average, home prices are 46.4% lower than at their 2007 peak, and prices won't match those of the boom years any time soon. At best, property price gains will help damaged banks cut some of their huge losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the final years of the past housing boom, house prices rose 14.2% and 1.7% respectively, in 2006 and 2007. When the bubble burst, prices fell an annual 12.4% in 2008, and then plunged 18.6% in 2009 and 10.5% in 2010. Prices also fell by 16.7% in 2011 and by 4.5% in 2012, the CSO said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices for commercial property also slumping, Irish banks were left with huge losses, and required huge sums from Irish taxpayers to rescue them from collapse. Ireland eventually was forced to strike an international bailout deal in late 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government projects the Irish economy will grow 2% in 2014 after two years of stagnation. It says that both exports and consumer spending will drive growth. However, large amounts of household debt, a legacy of the crash, will weigh on the economy for years to come, analysts say.</p>

</div><div class="author">Neil MacLucas  </div><div>528 words</div><div>23 January 2014</div><div>00:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZURICH—Switzerland will raise the amount of capital banks must set aside against the mortgages they extend, as the government tries to curb the country's booming housing market amid concerns it may overheat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said Thursday the <span class="companylink">Swiss National Bank</span> will require the country's lenders to hold 2% of mortgage risk-weighted assets to underpin their home lending. The level is double the 1% banks have been required to hold since October 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to further tighten bank lending for property purchases comes as Switzerland's residential property market still shows signs of overheating, particularly in prime residential areas such as Zurich and Geneva. Money has flowed into real estate in recent years as the SNB holds interest rates near zero to lessen the appeal of the Swiss franc and support the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zurich-based central bank said it had to raise the capital buffer because the lower buffer established earlier had failed to stop property prices from rising. The capital buffer is the only mechanism the SNB can use to control the volume of mortgage lending in Switzerland because raising interest rates would jeopardize the floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro it set a little more than two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The SNB has concluded the sustained strong increase in mortgage loans and the prices of Swiss residential properties has caused the imbalances to become even greater in the current low interest-rate environment," the Swiss Federal cabinet said in a statement Thursday. The higher buffer will be effective starting June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest quarterly Swiss house-price index, compiled by property consultants Fahrlaender Partner, showed that demand for Swiss property in the mid- and low-price sectors quickened again in the fourth quarter, although price gains for luxury homes eased. The average price of a Swiss condominium gained 3% in the three months through December compared with the previous quarter. Detached houses rose 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the government's move was unlikely to put the brakes on housing-price rises because it probably wouldn't add much to the cost of a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The measures will probably add 5 to 10 basis points to the cost of a five-year mortgage," said Matthias Holzhey, a property analyst at <span class="companylink">UBS AG</span>, Switzerland's biggest bank. "I doubt they will stop the upward house-price trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in mortgages for residential property continued to outstrip the expansion of Swiss gross domestic product last year, according to the SNB, suggesting growth in the economy may not be able to support the additional spending on homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total outstanding volume of residential mortgages at Swiss banks reached 652 billion Swiss francs ($715 billion) at the end of November, up 4.8% from CHF622 billion a year earlier, according SNB data. Over the same period, the economy grew about 1.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span> estimates banks now hold a total of about CHF2 billion to cover the 1% currently required. The increase in the level will push the total to CHF4 billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MetLife Inc. purchased a share of the Westin New York at Times Square. The Deal of the Week column in the Property Report on Wednesday incorrectly said that MetLife purchased a share of the Westin New York Grand Central.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Jan. 23, 2014)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, hotels and resorts were among the least attractive sectors in commercial real estate. Properties were filing for bankruptcy at a rapid rate, lenders were writing down the value of mortgages and buyers were scarce. These days, hotels and resorts are hot properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is good news for investors that were big buyers during the downturn, including <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Rockpoint Group</span>. The rebound also has worked out well for insurance giant <span class="companylink">MetLife Inc</span>., which added to its hotel portfolio during the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> is doubling down. In late December, <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> bought a stake in four brand-name hotels, including a majority stake in two resorts -- the Swan and Dolphin hotels -- at the <span class="companylink">Walt Disney World Resort</span> in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. The company declined to disclose what it paid, but the two adjacent properties recently were appraised at $638 million, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">MetLife</span>, which has a $12 billion real-estate portfolio, said it expects to do more hotel deals. "Investing in hotels and resort properties fits with our strategy to be in robust, tier-one markets in order to drive income and build appreciation," said Robert Merck, a senior managing director at <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> who heads the global real-estate investment group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal comes as investors are showing more interest in resort hotels nationwide. Last year, investors spent $4.5 billion to acquire resort hotels, up 140% from 2012. The average price per unit increased 112% to nearly $367,000, according to preliminary year-end research from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Both were the highest levels since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resorts suffered a double whammy during the downturn: Vacation spending dried up while businesses scaled back on the conferences that can be lucrative for hotel operators. "It was the perfect storm," said Dan Fasulo, a Real Capital Analytics managing director. As the lending environment deteriorated, many hotels fell into foreclosure and were sold at significant discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy began to recover, acquisitions of apartment buildings and office space were first to rebound. Now resorts are "finally starting to get some traction in this recovery," said Mr. Fasulo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resort hotels are benefiting as businesses and consumers spend more. In November, revenue per available room was $78.14, up 8% from the prior year, according STR, a hotel research firm. Occupancy climbed to 57.8%, from 56.4% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, research from <span class="companylink">MLV &amp; Co</span>., which tracks publicly held hotels, shows that convention-center bookings are up 5% for 2014 after being down 1% at this time in 2013. "You're seeing leisure accelerate across resorts [and] investors can see the group bookings on the books," said MLV analyst Ryan Meliker. "You've got more confidence and willingness to pay up for those assets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry watchers expect resort deals to continue to be hot in 2014. "Resorts in general, and Florida resorts, are viewed as highly attractive," said Dan Peek, who leads brokerage HFF's hotel practice. "The market has come around to the point that most resort markets are worthy investments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> deal involved <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> buying Silverpeak Real Estate Partners' 25% interest in several properties owned by Tishman Realty Corp., including the Westin New York Grand Central and the Sheraton Chicago Hotel &amp; Towers. <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> already owned a portion of the Swan and Dolphin hotels, so this deal brings its ownership to 59%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resort complex, which opened in 1989 and 1990 and has about 2,300 rooms, is located between Epcot and <span class="companylink">Disney</span>'s Hollywood Studios. <span class="companylink">Disney</span> doesn't own the buildings, but it owns the underlying land and receives compensation. Westin runs the Swan while Sheraton operates the Dolphin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swan's and Dolphin's occupancy rates were above 80% in 2013, up from the high 60s in 2002, according to Morningstar. "The properties perform much better relative to their peer groups," Morningstar wrote. The firm calculated the revenue per available room at more than $139 and the annual net cash flow at $39 million. It values each room at $211,217.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKYO—Japan's long-frozen property market has thawed enough for Toshiko Oguchi to sell her condominium, a hopeful sign of economic recovery from a national slump stretching back two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese-language teacher in her mid-60s had been living in her three-bedroom apartment in a posh Tokyo neighborhood for more than 30 years, trapped by Japan's 65% fall in housing prices between 1991 and 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ads from real-estate agents began piling up in Ms. Oguchi's mailbox this summer. Encouraged, she put her condo on the market in late September, and it was snapped up a week later for a seemingly miraculous price—about 30% more than she paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within weeks, two longtime neighbors also sold their flats and moved. "I've never seen anything like this," said Ms. Oguchi, who wanted a smaller apartment for her senior years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say a real-estate recovery would help reverse the debilitating psychic damage suffered by Japan's consumers after years of falling prices. The nation's so-called deflationary mind-set—characterized by a deep-seated pessimism about the future—has steered Japanese toward hoarding and caution, and away from spending and risk-taking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conviction that tough times will continue indefinitely has been a drag on Japan's economy. Instead of spending, Japan's wary consumers scrimp and sock money in the bank at a savings rate four times the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The caution was well-deserved. Real-estate prices declined for nearly a quarter century and wiped out an estimated $9.3 trillion in national wealth during the worst of Japan's asset drop, between 1990 and 2002, according to the <span class="companylink">Nomura Research Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But evidence of a rebound is encouraging. Average sale prices for new condos in Tokyo have reached their highest annual level since 1992, according to the Real Estate Economic Institute Co. A three-bedroom apartment of about 1,290 square feet, for example, sold for $1.7 million this fall in the popular Shinjuku area of Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new condos in Tokyo grew by 31% between May and December last year, compared with the same period in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resale prices are growing at a slower pace. The Tokyo Stock Exchange Home Price Index, a Japanese version of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Index that tracks condo prices in Tokyo, was up 3.3% in October from the previous year, but still 11% below the precrisis 2007 peak, and 59% below June 1993 prices, the earliest index listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing condos in the Tokyo area grew 17% between May and September last year compared with the same period in 2012, according to Real Estate Information Network For East Japan, which tracks sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing confidence in real estate followed the aggressive monetary-easing and government-spending policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office a year ago promising to end 20 years of falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan was one of the fastest-growing among developed nations in the first half of 2013, with its economy expanding at an annualized pace of about 4%, although growth has slowed in recent months. Stocks have benefited, too, with the Nikkei Stock Average rising 57% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span>'s report released last week showed the recovery spreading to all of the nation's regional economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still a long road ahead. Japan's property decline was so steep that average prices remain 71% below their peak in 1991. Nearly a quarter of the population has never seen a sustained price rise longer than a brief spike between 2005 and 2008. And overall land prices are still declining nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a government survey of major urban areas showed increases in more than two-thirds of the areas tallied over the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say rising real-estate prices in the high-demand neighborhoods could trigger a positive cycle of home-buying and land appreciation, spurring increases in wealth and spending. "You can't turn around the deflationary mind-set until property prices stop falling," said Yuichiro Kawaguchi, a professor at Waseda University who teaches real-estate finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Oguchi, who looked outside Tokyo for a new home, was surprised to find prices rising over a matter of weeks this fall. She looked at 15 condos for sale near the port city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. Fearful of being priced out of the market, she bought a 20-year-old condo further from Yokohama than she had wanted. "I panicked a little," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market is still far from robust. Slightly more than 80% of 1,038 people who sold real estate to buy new homes in the Tokyo area between April 2012 and March 2013 lost money on their sale, according to a June survey by the Association of Real Estate Agents of Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But borrowing costs remain cheap, with 20- to 30-year mortgage loans offered at rates between 1.8% and 2.5%; 10-year mortgages are below 1.5%, though they are expected to rise with inflation as the economy improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have risen for 15 straight months, the longest streak since the early 1990s and driven largely by new single-family homes outside Tokyo's urban core.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much like the U.S. housing recovery, property prices in Japan are spotty, depending on the city and the neighborhood. Sales and prices for new condos have moved slower in the western part of Japan, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tokyo real-estate agents say the local boom is fueled in part by buyers seeking to purchase newly constructed homes—subject to a sales tax—before the tax grows from 5% to 8% in April. Some economists worry the tax increase could chill the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Japan's hottest-selling neighborhoods are in central Tokyo, close to financial districts. <span class="companylink">Nomura Real Estate Development Co</span>., for example, sold 306 condos in the Shinjuku area from mid-October through early December, with average prices of $660,000 for apartments under 800 square feet. Real Estate Economic Institute figures show inventories of new condos in these areas fell 19% in November compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Takashi Okamura, assistant manager at real-estate broker <span class="companylink">Tokyu Livable Inc</span>., said the number of used-condo transactions his firm handled increased 32% from April to September last year, compared with 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hanging over his office is the fear of another collapse, similar to market drops that followed the 2008 financial crisis and 2011 earthquake. "The number of clients is increasing, and we're so busy that we can't really take days off,'' he said. Still, he added with a hint of his country's deflationary mind-set, "the recovery is not strong enough to get excited over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yusuke Yamada is the kind of new-home buyer keeping real-estate agents busy. The 27-year-old cellphone-company employee decided to buy his first condo in July, prompted by a concern that prices would rise and erode the value of his savings. He spent five months researching the popularity ranking of cities and the most-coveted apartment designs. He combed online websites showing price trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yamada's quest ultimately took him to a 44-story tower in Tokyo Bay, an area of reclaimed land about 2 miles southeast of central Tokyo. Prices there are expected to benefit from a proposed casino resort and new projects linked to the 2020 Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitsui Fudosan Residential Co. and the five other developers responsible for the tower erected a three-story sales pavilion containing three condo models near the project site. Prospective buyers ride an escalator through a dark hall with stars projected on the ceiling to simulate the condo's observatory deck and take a canoe ride to the construction site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales pitch includes a 10-minute movie portraying a dream life for buyers—with actors living in a condo surrounded by night stars and a green forest, and two children who grow up to be an astronomer and botanist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yamada visited the sales pavilion in May. He returned with his girlfriend two months later to sign a contract for a condo on the 39th floor selling for ¥52 million, or about $500,000. As he signed, more than 20 people gathered in a nearby room for a real-estate seminar arranged by the developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People feel that it's time to make a decision now since rates on mortgage loans will start to go up as the economy gets better," said Yutaka Saitou, executive manager of Mitsui Fudosan's sales group. He supervised the sales staff at the pavilion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since sales began in July, 86% of the 1,110 units have sold, Mr. Saitou said, with the first move-ins to begin after construction is completed in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yamada said he hoped the value of his condo would rise, but he wasn't completely optimistic about Japan's recovery or his own prospects. He said he didn't expect his salary to go up anytime soon, and he was cutting back on purchases to prepare for his condo transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yamada tracks seven categories of expenses including rent, food and transportation in an Excel spreadsheet. He now bikes to work, one of the corners he has cut to save ¥100,000, or about $960, a month for his 20% down payment. He has until March 2015, when his unit will be ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, a rush of new-home buying hasn't yet translated into broad economic optimism, said Mr. Kawaguchi, the real-estate finance professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tokyo resident Takashi <span class="companylink">Kubota</span>, a 29-year-old former worker at a coffee-shop chain, is bullish on real estate but still clings to a deflationary mind-set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The barista, who left his job in October to set up his own business creating <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> video guides for foreign visitors, is saving to buy a used condo as a rental property. He is counting on Japan's rock-bottom interest rates, figuring he can supplement his income by renting the apartment out for more than his monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Mr. Yamada, Mr. <span class="companylink">Kubota</span> isn't expecting his purchase to appreciate. In fact, he said, he was prepared for prices to fall. But his instructors at the Tokyo-based Financial Academy show how real-estate investments can yield a return of at least 10% a year when mortgage rates are very low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. <span class="companylink">Kubota</span> said he was aiming to buy an apartment for ¥5 million or less—a price tag 2½ times his annual income last year of ¥2 million. He planned to finance the purchase with savings and a 20-year mortgage. He saves as much as 70% of his monthly income, he said, in part by living with his parents. He has so far accumulated about ¥4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. <span class="companylink">Kubota</span> said he was unlikely to change his pessimistic view of the market, or his investing style, even if property prices continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pursuing capital gains is like gambling," Mr. <span class="companylink">Kubota</span> said. "It doesn't matter whether the economy goes up or down. I don't want to take high risks."</p>

</div><div class="author">Ilona Billington </div><div>811 words</div><div>21 January 2014</div><div>02:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Euro-zone house prices rose at the fastest quarterly pace in over two years in the third quarter of 2013, figures showed Tuesday, a sign that the slow economic recovery continued in the second half of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released by the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency also indicate that some of the housing markets that had suffered the most severe downturns in the wake of the financial crisis began to recover last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That development—alongside a stabilization in unemployment—could help support consumer spending, and aid the financial repair of banks that lent heavily against homes before the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said house prices across the 17 country euro zone were 0.6% higher in the third quarter of 2013 compared with the second quarter, and fell 1.3% in annual terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly gain was the strongest since a 1.1% increase in the second quarter of 2011, while the annual drop was the smallest since the fourth quarter of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter of 2013 house prices in the euro zone rose 0.2% from the previous quarter and declined 2.4% in annual terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall the euro zone housing market still feels subdued, but there does seem to be quite strong signs that house prices are close to bottoming out in some areas," said Michael Ball, professor of urban and property economics at Henley Business School, Reading University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These figures indicate that the support the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> has given the housing market in terms of mortgage liquidity and low interest rates has halted a sharper downturn, and means that in macroeconomic terms the housing market isn't as much of a worry as it was earlier in the financial crisis," Mr. Ball said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued improvement in the third-quarter data is in line with ongoing but small gains recorded elsewhere across the euro-zone economy. After ending an 18 month recession in the second quarter of last year, gross domestic product in the euro zone grew 0.1% on the quarter in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details from <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> show the gain in house prices was led by a 5.3% quarterly rise in Estonia and a 4.1% increase in Ireland, where the property crash between 2008 and 2012 saw prices tumble 49% from their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs that prices in the Irish capital of Dublin have started to rise have been eagerly seized on by the Irish authorities as evidence that the property crash that sent the economy into a tailspin and wrecked the banks, is on the mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irish home prices have now risen for the eighth successive month, led by increases in Dublin, according to official data, providing evidence that the country's six-year housing slump is easing in the capital at least.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> also reported a 1.2% quarter-on-quarter gain in house prices across France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rise comes despite a tough economic background and still rising unemployment, and likely reflects some improvement in supply, according to the Fédération national de l'immobilier, or French National Real Estate Federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that there is a slight pickup in supply and the number of transactions are increasing in attractive areas," said <span class="companylink">FNAIM</span>'s deputy director Jacky Chapelot. "But it is a slow recovery and would be hurt by any increase in lending rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> doesn't chart official data for German house prices, the estimate they use is based on <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> statistics that showed house prices in the largest euro-area economy grew around 1.0% over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain and the Netherlands both posted sharp turnarounds from the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spain, <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said house prices grew 0.8% on the quarter in the third quarter after a 0.8% decline in the second quarter while in the Netherlands house prices grew 0.6% after a 2.0% drop in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the quarterly increase in Spain follows a similar one reported by the country's National Statistics Institute, there are doubts over whether those gains will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fotocasa—one of the country's top real-estate firms—said prices fell in many parts of the country last year, with price increases limited to some districts of larger cities, particularly Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In 2013 we saw a change in the pessimistic mood…but it is early to speak of recovery or end of the adjustment period because property transfers and new mortgages are at very low levels and there is a significant mismatch between supply and demand," said Beatriz Toribio, head of Fotocasa's research department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just five of the 17 countries saw house prices fall between July and September last year, according to the data—Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia and Finland. </p>

</div><div class="author">Rachel Pannett  </div><div>973 words</div><div>21 January 2014</div><div>08:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIVERPOOL, Australia—This once-downtrodden Sydney suburb is on the rise, an emblem of Australia's booming housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dilapidated cottages and housing estates are giving way to large homes and modern multistory apartments. Vacant land for residential development here goes for as much as A$400,000 ($352,574) per acre, compared with about A$200,000 five years ago, according to <span class="companylink">Australand Property Group</span>, a developer in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom in Australia, once thought to be limited primarily to central Sydney, is spreading to other parts of the country. Prices of land and houses are rising in numerous cities and suburbs, fueled largely by demand from both large and small investors looking for yield amid low interest rates engineered by the central bank to keep the economy growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, house prices rose almost 10% last year, the strongest gain since 2010, according to data released earlier this month by RP Data, a property research firm. Sydney saw the largest rise with a 14.5% increase, but prices were up 9.9% in Perth, 8.5% in Melbourne and 5.1% in Brisbane, the firm said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have new land releases where people are sleeping overnight to secure the land to build their new home," Liverpool's mayor, Ned Mannoun, said in a recent interview from an office that overlooks pawn shops and dollar stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increases have fueled a debate over whether the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> should raise interest rates to keep the market from overheating. Back in 2010, when house prices last rose sharply, the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank</span> tightened policy to cool things off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately the bank has been keeping rates at a record-low 2.5% to aid an economy that is slowing as a decadelong mining boom fades. Australia sidestepped the global financial crisis largely because of the strength of its mining industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank doesn't want to raise rates, a blunt tool that could undercut a revival of retail spending and construction. Bank officials say a housing bubble isn't emerging yet, arguing the rate of house-price increases is in line with income gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the central bank is closely watching a sharp uptick in mortgage lending, particularly to people buying houses strictly as investments rather than as a place to live. A report from the <span class="companylink">Australian Bureau of Statistics</span> last week showed the value of home loans approved in November rose to A$26.9 billion, a 15% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over 46% of the loans in November went to investors, compared with 43% a year earlier, according to AMP Capital, one of the country's largest fund managers. First-home buyers accounted for only 12.3% of the loan volume, the lowest level in more than two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's biggest banks have been competing for a bigger share of the mortgage business, waiving application fees and asking for down payments as low as 5% of purchase prices. Nearly a fifth of home buyers have put down as little as 10%, while more than half of all new loans are for interest-only mortgages, which are popular among investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the growing role of investors is helping drive up prices. Some say this is a source of concern because investors are more likely than owner-occupiers to sell in a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A growing proportion of the market owned by investors potentially introduces an element of instability in house prices that hasn't been there before," says Saul Eslake, chief Australia economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large development companies—both foreign and domestic—are increasing investments in housing projects in fringe areas. But there also are many small investors in the market partly because Australia's pension system gives citizens the ability to opt out of official plans and manage their own investments, including in residential property. In other countries including the U.S., people generally can't do that with money in 401(k) plans and other employer-sponsored pension programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are pushing many of these investors into the suburbs, where houses are cheaper, says Paul Love, a 43-year-old maintenance engineer who owns three investment properties in the Sydney area. He bought the latest, a four-bedroom house with a double garage in Sans Souci—about 12 miles from the city center—six months ago for more than A$1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Love says investing in housing "is easier to understand" than the stock market. "I buy it, they pay rent, I pay the mortgage. The price goes up," he says. "I don't like the idea of having A$100,000 worth of shares one day and waking up the next day to find you only have A$1,000 worth of shares."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But investors are making it difficult for people like Jason Silverii, a 40-year-old corporate affairs manager for a large Australian law firm. He and his wife started looking for a home five years ago in Kew, a well-heeled suburb not far from Melbourne's city center, but they were continually outbid at auction, often by investors. "You'd go to auctions and scan the crowd and you could just tell: single guy in his 30s, dark suit," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months ago, they settled on a three-bedroom house with a small courtyard and double garage in Reservoir, a working-class suburb miles from the city center. They paid A$470,000 for the blonde-brickhome at auction, more than 30% above the quoted price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't see it as the house we'll grow old in," Mr. Silverii says. "You have to trade lifestyle to get into the property market."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Chinese Property Prices Rose in December; Prices in Major Cities Up 9.2% From a Year Earlier; Month-to-Month Pace Slowed</span>
</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>589 words</div><div>17 January 2014</div><div>20:57</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—New-home prices in major Chinese cities in December were up 9.2% from a year earlier, but month-to-month figures suggest Beijing's efforts to cool the market are continuing to have an impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advance was led by the nation's largest cities, data released Saturday show. The uneven pace of home prices and sales across the country poses a challenge for authorities, who worry that the high cost of housing in a number of markets could lead to social unrest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese authorities in recent years have unveiled efforts to cool the market, including mortgage restrictions and limits on multiple-home purchases. Analysts and developers have said they are watching for hints of new cooling measures such as capital-gains and property taxes. But the need to keep the economy humming has made policy makers cautious about clamping down too hard on the property market, a key growth engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in December were up from a year earlier in 65 of the 70 cities surveyed by the government, according to data released on Saturday. At 9.2%, the average price increase marked an acceleration from November's 9.1%, according to Wall Street Journal calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding prices of social-housing units, which are for low-income households, average housing prices in December were up 9.7%. But the month-to-month price changes suggest some cooling. The average increase from a month earlier in December was 0.38%, compared with 0.53% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, there were sharp increases in home prices in top-tier cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou—which offer what are seen as better jobs and schools and attract home buyers from the rest of the country. Guangzhou led the way in December, with home prices up 20.1% from a year earlier, while Shenzhen prices were up 19.9%, Shanghai prices were up 18.2% and Beijing prices were up 16%. In Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the month-to-month pace slowed in December, while in Shanghai it was unchanged from November's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing markets in first-tier cities and some of the second-tier cities where there had been high property prices are stabilizing," said Liu Jianwei, a statistician from the statistics bureau. In recent months, some of these cities had introduced further tightening measures such as higher down-payment requirements for second home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December prices were up from November in 65 of the cities, falling only in Wenzhou and Shaoguan. Prices in three cities were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have said that they expect China's housing market to moderate this year. Average housing prices are expected to rise 5%, said ratings firm <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, with housing sales projected to grow 10%. Increases in urbanization and disposable incomes will underpin demand for homes this year, said S&amp;P analyst Bei Fu, though she added that developers may face more financing risks this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger property developers so far have remained sanguine about business prospects in 2014, saying demand in first-tier and major second tier-cities would still be strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm still confident of the business of selling high-end homes, as the buying power of Chinese consumers remains strong," said Tianjin-based property developer <span class="companylink">Sunac China Holdings</span> chairman Sun Hongbin last week, though noting that demand is concentrated in major cities, rather than spread across the country. </p>

</div><div class="author">Eric Morath </div><div>564 words</div><div>17 January 2014</div><div>06:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—New-home construction retained a strong pace in December, showing the market is broadly improving but remains well below historical averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts decreased 9.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 999,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. But the figure was well above summer levels and exceeded economists' forecast for 975,000 starts in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's pace, revised up to 1.11 million from the previous estimate of 1.09 million, was the strongest in more than five years. However, 2008 to 2012 were the five worst years for housing starts on records back to 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The upward trend continues, but we're still a long way from what we think of as a sustainable pace," said David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If younger Americans were leaving parents' homes and creating new households at historical averages, builders would need to create about 1.5 million units per year to meet demand, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December building permits, an indicator of future construction, declined 3.0% to a 986,000 pace. Permits also fell in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2013, housing starts advanced 18.3% from the prior year to 923,400. That marked the strongest year for starts since 2007, the year the recession began. Permits were up 17.5% from 2012 to 974,700, also the strongest reading since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the decade before the recession began, builders started 1.7 million homes per year on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, both single-family home starts and multi-unit structures declined from the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes, a bigger and more stable segment of the market, fell 7.0% to an annual pace of 667,000 in December. Despite the drop, the level was still the second strongest reading in the category since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly home construction figures had trended up since the start of 2011 until the early part of last year. However, when interest rate rose sharply in the spring, the pace of building slowed. Rising rates make mortgage payments more expensive for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates stabilized in the fall, aiding home building. In December, the Federal Reserve said it would reduce the size of bond purchases by $10 billion a month, taking a small first step away from a policy designed to boost economic growth. That pullback may have put some upward pressure on interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage edged up to 4.48% at the end of December from 4.29% in late November, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates have mostly held steady so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data could indicate a pickup in available apartments this year, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. The number of multi-family starts intended for rent in 2013 was the highest in 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth came in markets such as Austin, Texas and Orange County, Calif., in addition to high-rise cities such as New York and San Francisco, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since the typical multi-unit building is under construction for a bit more than a year, the jump in rental starts in 2013 means lots of new rentals coming onto the market in 2014," Mr. Kolko said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction in the 17 countries that then shared the euro fell in November for the third straight month, an indication that the currency area's recovery has yet to spread to all parts of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency Friday said construction output fell by 0.6% from October, and 1.7% from November 2012. Output also fell in September and October, having been higher in the third quarter compared with the three months to June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said that, while work on civil engineering projects increased over the month, construction of residential and commercial buildings declined.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The performance of the construction sector contrasts with other parts of the economy, which were much stronger in November. Industrial production rose at the fastest pace since May 2010, while retail sales increased at the quickest rate on record, and the currency area's trade surplus rose. Overall, the figures for November point to an expansion in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the decline in construction suggests that investment spending has yet to pick up strongly in the euro zone.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. home sales were the highest in December in almost six years, according to a survey Thursday, although <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> officials say a rapid recovery in Britain's housing market doesn't pose a risk to financial stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> showed U.K. home sales in December were at their highest since March 2008, with surveyors reporting an average 21.3 sales each during the month. Peter Bolton King, the RICS global residential director, said an increase in affordable mortgages has released pent-up demand from would-be buyers who have struggled to get a foothold in the housing market in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony in Parliament on Wednesday, BOE Gov. Mark Carney and officials from the central bank's Financial Policy Committee played down lawmakers' concerns that a dangerous new bubble in prices is forming in the housing market following a recent pickup in lending. The officials did say they're keeping a close eye on lending standards to ensure borrowers don't take on too much debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts fear this bubble could burst if interest rates rise, sending house prices tumbling and leaving banks and borrowers nursing heavy losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in the U.K. rose 5.4% on the year in November, according to the most recent data from the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span>, and analysts expect prices to rise further in 2014, buoyed by cheap mortgages and a government-run program to aid home buyers, called Help-to-Buy. The program offers buyers with little or no deposit a taxpayer guarantee to secure a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney told lawmakers on Parliament's treasury committee the central bank expects house prices to keep rising this year and next, although added gains in 2015 are likely to be at a slower pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canadian central banker said Britain's housing market is recovering from a period of little activity and that rising prices largely reflect a shortage of homes to meet buyer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the areas where people either want to live or have to live there just isn't that magnitude of supply," Mr. Carney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One area where prices have risen particularly fast is London. Mr. Carney said price increases in the capital's central districts are being driven by foreign buyers paying cash, who are less vulnerable to changes in interest rates or declines in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE governor said officials are monitoring lending standards closely, as bubbles tend to form and risks to the financial system emerge when borrowers take on much larger loans than they can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been that deterioration in lending standards…that type of behavior that drives the last bubble-like phase of the housing market and creates the financial stability problem."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials added they are mindful of the risks to homeowners and the wider economy from a rise in interest rates, which would push up repayments for many borrowers and squeeze consumer spending. Mr. Carney told lawmakers the central bank is examining mortgage-market data closely to determine which groups of borrowers might be particularly at risk if borrowing costs were to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE has kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.5% since March 2009 and officials have pledged to keep it there at least until unemployment drops to 7%. The jobless rate was 7.4% in October, according to the ONS's most recent data.</p>

</div><div class="author">Candace Jackson </div><div>1537 words</div><div>16 January 2014</div><div>15:16</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new wrinkle in the boom of ultra high-end condominium development is the rising popularity of small buildings, each with just a handful of units. In many cases, each unit is priced as high as a penthouse or a mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under construction in Miami Beach is a 10-story, 8-unit building called Beach House 8, which has 3,900-square-foot four-bedrooms with 1,200-square-foot terraces starting at $5.9 million. In Boston, No. 6 Newbury Street, in the heart of the upscale shopping district in the Back Bay neighborhood, is almost completed; its four, 5,600-square-foot condos perched above a Chanel store are priced at $7 million and up. In New York's SoHo neighborhood, 33-year-old developer Jared Kushner is converting the eighth and ninth floors above offices at the historic Puck building into the Puck Penthouses: six apartments listed between $21 million and $60 million apiece. Mr. Kushner says he and his wife, developer and fashion designer Ivanka Trump, plan to move into one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the buildings are new to the market, and some real-estate veterans warn that living in small multiunit buildings come with trade-offs. But the strategy has shown some signs of success. Last year, an unfinished unit at Boston's Newbury Street project sold for $7.8 million, breaking the record for the city's most expensive condo sale in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky paid $9.5 million last year for a fourth-floor unit at the Whitman, a small building with three, 4,900-square-foot condo units. Hedge-fund trader John Silvetz purchased the third-floor unit, and Nascar racer Jeff Gordon bought the second-floor unit for just under $10 million after selling his apartment in 15 Central Park West, a 202-unit building, for $25 million. (The Whitman's fourth unit, a 6,500-square-foot, two-story penthouse with a 3,100-square-foot terrace, is asking $25 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Matthews, a 55-year-old software entrepreneur, recently put a large deposit on an $8.4 million, 14th-floor apartment in Glass, an 18-story Miami Beach building with 10 units, expected to be completed in June 2015. Mr. Matthews says he was impressed with the building's views, the level of finishes and its intimate size. With the number of foreign pied-à-terre buyers in Miami, he doubts that more than a few will live there full-time. "I will have a lot of privacy, I like that," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxurious multifamily buildings with large units are common in cities like Paris and London, and in some prewar buildings in the U.S. But newly built smaller buildings with spacious condos are relatively rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents and developers say the higher prices for smaller buildings mirror the higher-end shift that is happening in the market overall. Zoning rules and construction economics can sometimes play a role as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After developing 15 Central Park West, the luxury Manhattan building where Mr. Gordon recently sold a unit, developers William and Arthur Zeckendorf bought a former women's residence and converted its more than 200 single-occupancy studios into 14 full-floor apartments, a duplex and a mansionette. Units at 18 Gramercy Park went on the market in 2012 with prices starting at $9.53 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One advantage of developing a smaller project, says William Zeckendorf, is that with less space dedicated to common areas like hallways, a much larger percentage of the building's square footage is salable. Many boutique buildings have elevators that open directly into apartments, or small private landings. "You give up a lot of space to corridors," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori Ordover, a consultant for condo developers, says limited air rights in a number of desirable locations, like neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan, have partly contributed to the rise in super high-end, smaller projects. Plus, smaller buildings where all the units are similar in size makes sense from a development standpoint because things such as ventilation and bathrooms can all be stacked on top of each other, as opposed to being arranged to maximize the number of apartments on each floor. "It's very cost-efficient," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is sometimes less cost-efficient for owners. Because employee salaries and other major building expenses are spread across a smaller number of homeowners, monthly charges can be very high. Monthly condo association fees for a 3,400-square-foot, $7.9 million listing at Glass, the Miami Beach building, are about $1.79 per square foot, compared with about $1.48 per-square-foot for condo and amenity fees for a 2,800-square-foot, $7.49 million listing at Continuum on South Beach, a large beachfront complex with a 40-story tower and a 37-story tower nearby, according to listing data. (A real-estate agent for Glass says the building offers more personalized service, and its monthlies are less than some other comparable buildings nearby.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most luxurious smaller buildings have relatively limited amenities compared with larger condominiums. Newer, larger buildings often include everything from private screening rooms to pet spas. Smaller ones typically have a small gym and maybe a lobby lounge area. At the Puck Penthouses, where monthly charges average $9,364, there is a 24-hour doorman and refrigerated storage for groceries, but few additional amenities. "[Buyers] have enough space where they could do gyms in their home, and the master bathrooms include steam showers," says Mr. Kushner, the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, having just a few neighbors can have its downsides. Steven Sladkus, a New York-based attorney who handles condo and cooperative-board issues as well as disputes between neighbors and developers, says disputes between neighbors can become more pronounced in smaller buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bigger the building, the more diluted the population, which might make the frequency of arguments less," he says. In general, ultraluxury buildings of all sizes are prone to neighborly disputes and what he terms "clashes of the egos." William Zeckendorf said disagreements between neighbors can be equally contentious in large and small buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in new buildings, issues like roof replacement can occasionally arise, which can cost a building's owners' $1 million or more, says Mr. Sladkus, a significant cost when split just a few ways. If "there's something wrong with the structure, you're dividing it by a smaller number of people that have to pay," adds Donna Olshan, a New York real-estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the developers and real-estate agents behind these buildings argue that smaller condominiums appeal to high-profile, privacy-seeking buyers looking for similarly wealthy neighbors. In cities like New York and Miami, where many high-rises are under construction, smaller buildings offer an alternative, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beach House 8 in Miami was designed partly for buyers looking for a "more intimate" alternative to Miami's sleek high-rises, says developer Valerio Morabito. The size of the building means owners won't have the "inconvenience that exists when you come down to your lobby and have to meet people," he says. In addition to the 3,900-square-foot units, a 5,200-square-foot, two-story penthouse will have 6,000-square-feet of outdoor space and a price tag of $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers also say that proximity to other similarly priced homes is appealing to potential buyers. Don Peebles, a real-estate developer, is breaking ground soon on the Bath Club Estates, a 13-unit condo in Miami Beach with one unit per floor and outdoor terraces so large "they resemble yards." The building will also have two spas, a screening room, a gym and two chauffeur-driven Maseratis. Monthly fees will be roughly $2 a square foot. Buying a penthouse on top of less expensive units "means you've got the best home in the neighborhood," Mr. Peebles says. "In real estate, that's not really what you want."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small projects can give developers a way to design a place where they can live. Mr. Peebles is getting a unit for himself at Bath Club Estates. On a tour, Mr. Kushner, who is moving into Puck Penthouses with his wife, showed off custom-made, nickel-and-glass doors that he says went through more than a dozen design revisions. "That's really hard to justify when you're doing 50 apartments," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space could have been split up into a larger number of smaller apartments, but Mr. Kushner says the 6-unit size would keep it "a little bit clubby.…People will be kind of able to know each other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers just want more space. Stefano Frittella, a restaurateur who splits his time between New York, Miami and Monaco, is planning to buy a 6,000-square-foot unit at Bath Club Estates. He already owns a 4,000-square-foot unit in a larger building built by the same developer nearby. "It's like you're living in a house," he says. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>. confirmed Thursday it sold its office space at the <span class="companylink">Time Warner Center</span> in Manhattan for $1.3 billion to developer Related Cos. and will lease back the office space until 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related and <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> were close to a deal but needed financing for the bid, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Two sovereign-wealth funds—the <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</span>—have aided Related in purchasing the 1.1 million square feet of office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> will relocate to a building that Related plans to develop in its Hudson Yards project on Manhattan's far West Side. <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> said it would acquire more than one million square feet of available commercial space in 30 Hudson Yards located at the southwest corner of 10th Avenue and 33rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company expects about 5,000 employees from its corporate operations and its HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and Warner Bros. businesses to occupy the Hudson Yards space by the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> and Related have agreed to develop Hudson Yards and expect to finish the final building development documents in the first half of the year. Related hasn't completed financing for that building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> spent about $520 million to construct its current headquarters about a decade ago. Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said the move is an important step in the company's two-year long process to start consolidating its New York operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's deal marks one of the biggest in a surge of deals involving foreign investors in U.S. commercial real estate. Increased demand from overseas has helped drive U.S. commercial property values to record levels, particularly in major cities favored by global firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers are seeking out the U.S. as a place to spend their growing piles of cash, particularly as other markets such as Europe remain anemic. Non-U.S. buyers purchased more than $46 billion of property in 2013, up from $35 billion in 2012 and the most since 2007, according to real estate data firm <span class="companylink">RealCapital Analytics Inc</span>.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ben Leubsdorf </div><div>775 words</div><div>15 January 2014</div><div>11:55</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Some regions of the U.S. are confronting labor shortages in construction and other high-skill fields, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s survey of regional economic conditions released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dallas Fed district reported "acute labor shortages" for auditors, engineers, truck drivers and construction workers in late November and December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Cleveland Fed</span> said hiring was "sluggish" for most industries, but construction firms were hiring. "Builders reported a scarcity of high-skilled trade workers," according to the report. "As a result, there is upward pressure on wages, and subcontractors are demanding and getting higher rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest beige book, which describes economic conditions across the central bank's 12 districts, painted a picture of firming labor markets across the U.S. as economic growth accelerates and major sectors such as real estate and manufacturing recover from the housing downturn and recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor markets showed signs of tightening," the Minneapolis district reported, with 30% of businesses saying they expect to hire more full-time workers in 2014 versus 18% who expect to have fewer full-time employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Richmond district, there were "numerous reports of strong labor demand," though the report also said few businesses offered permanent jobs to seasonal workers and there was high turnover among low-skill workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, two-thirds of districts reported "small to moderate" increases in hiring, according to the report, and many companies were optimistic as 2014 began. In the New York district, most companies said they kept staffing flat as 2013 came to a close, but "substantially more businesses plan to expand than reduce their workforces in 2014."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bright spots in Wednesday's survey came as hiring slowed across the U.S. last month, according to the Labor Department, which last week estimated the economy nationwide added just 74,000 nonfarm jobs in December. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.7%, largely because people left the workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book said overall economic growth was "moderate" in nine regions and "modest" in two others in late November and December. The Kansas City district said conditions "held steady" in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last such survey, released in December, showed seven districts growing moderately and four districts growing modestly. One other district only said economic activity was expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fed reports, the word "modest" has been used at times to indicate an expansion that's slightly slower than "moderate" growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book was released two weeks before the Fed's policy committee is scheduled to meet Jan. 28-29. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> must decide at the meeting how to proceed with winding down its bond-buying program, which seeks to boost the economy by lowering borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> announced in December it would reduce its $85 billion a month in bond purchases by $10 billion, starting this month. Outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank is likely to continue trimming its bond buying this year if economic data "broadly support" policy makers' expectations for improving employment and low inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> survey found retail spending was "modestly to moderately higher" in most areas compared with a year earlier. But the Richmond district reported slowing retail spending and the Kansas City district said holiday sales were lower than expected, "which retailers there attributed to a shorter selling season and harsh weather conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most areas reported improving real-estate markets, with residential sales, prices and construction on the rise. Two-thirds of districts said commercial property sales and leasing were up, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were described as "stable" in about half the districts and most of the rest reported "small increases," with a couple exceptions. A frozen fish producer in the Boston district, for instance, said prices for shrimp and haddock were "through the roof."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight of the 12 districts reported "small to moderate" increases in wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While spending on tourism and leisure was reportedly "mixed" across the country, the manufacturing sector saw "steady growth" and steady employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A manufacturer in the Dallas district said that for the first time since before the recession, his firm had too many jobs to bid on," according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No major changes in bank lending volume were reported, though six districts reported "slight to moderate growth," three saw no change and one— New York—saw a "moderate decline in loan volume."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy production and demand also remained strong, according to the report. The Atlanta district reported an increase in deep water oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, "bolstered by the completion of recent pipeline infrastructure projects."</p>

</div><div class="author">David George-Cosh </div><div>312 words</div><div>15 January 2014</div><div>05:44</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO—Canadian existing-home sales fell 1.8% in December from November as real-estate activity in most major cities slowed at the end of the year, the country's real-estate trade group said in its monthly report Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, home sales were up 12.9% in December, the <span class="companylink">Canadian Real Estate Association</span> said. Home sales were up just 0.8% in all of 2013 compared with the prior year, CREA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Multiple Listing Home Price Index, which is weighted to compensate for fluctuations in the composition of sales, rose 4.3% year-over-year in December, CREA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA said the number of newly listed homes was down 4.3% month-over-month in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian home sales softened after the <span class="companylink">Canadian government</span> tightened mortgage rules in the summer of 2012, and recovered to hit a high in September 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales activity isn't expected to reach the kind of highs seen in September 2013, this year could still be a strong one for Canadian sales, CREA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Absent further mortgage rule changes, sales in 2014 may surpass the annual total for 2013 if demand holds steady near current levels as strengthening economic and better job growth offset the impact of further expected marginal mortgage interest rate increases," Gregory Klump, chief economist for CREA, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average, the non-seasonally adjusted home price in Canada rose 10.4% year-over-year in December, CREA said, to 389,119 Canadian dollars ($355,035).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CREA said the price gain reflects strong sales activity in Vancouver and Toronto, two of Canada's most active and expensive markets. Omitting both cities would result in a year-over-year price increase of just 4.6%. </p>

</div><div class="author">Te-Ping Chen </div><div>764 words</div><div>15 January 2014</div><div>02:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—Hong Kong's leader Wednesday laid out an ambitious agenda to boost housing supply and narrow the split between the rich and poor, as public frustration over a lack of social mobility intensifies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his second policy address, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said the densely populated city plans to permit construction of taller residential buildings and develop a new metropolis on the island of Lantau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of more than seven million has experienced a record property boom in recent years, with prices more than doubling since 2008, ranking among the highest in the world. Mr. Leung said he was concerned that such a phenomenon, as well as cramped living spaces, is discouraging young families from having children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I often think, if a kindergartner asks me, 'Where will I live when I grow up?,' what answer should I give? 'Nowhere' is definitely not an acceptable answer," said Mr. Leung, noting the government has also identified 150 hectares of space that could be rezoned for residential use, enough to provide 210,000 additional apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stretched housing market has also helped fuel poverty in the city, which Mr. Leung plans to combat with a 3 billion Hong Kong dollar (US$387 million) program to increase subsidies to working low-income families numbering around 710,000 people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has been concerned about the persistence of intergenerational poverty in Hong Kong, traditionally known for its numerous mainland Chinese immigrants who have bootstrapped their way into enormous wealth. Class mobility appears to have become more stagnant over the years, according to the city's no. 2 official, Carrie Lam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The launch of the program to boost subsidies is partly the result of a "philosophical" shift within the government, said Ms. Lam, as the benefits of economic growth have failed to be evenly distributed, and that even working families remain in poverty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leung's populist emphasis on land supply and poverty alleviation came as the city is also wrestling with greater public demands for democracy. Over the new year, thousands marched to demand universal suffrage before 2017. Beijing has pledged that by that year at the earliest the former British colony will be able to directly elect its leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, some 66,000 took to the streets, according to police estimates, with marchers complaining that the administration hasn't moved aggressively enough to pave the way for democratic elections, a topic that Mr. Leung mentioned only briefly in his Wednesday address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of new plans to boost housing supply, the chief executive said the government will relax existing building restrictions outside the most densely populated urban centers to allow residential buildings to be as much as 20% taller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leung—who has made affordable housing one of his signature issues since taking office in 2012—also said the government will develop eastern Lantau, an island known for its green space and as the site of Disneyland, into a central business district to allow it to better tap into the growth of the surrounding Pearl River Delta, as well as to accommodate new residential projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with other property measures, Mr. Leung said the city was due for a significant increase in housing supply in the coming years. He estimates that the amount of housing produced by the private sector will rise by about 40% over the next five years, as compared with the previous five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the measures, in addition to stiff property taxes Mr. Leung has levied on purchases since assuming office, are likely to prompt residential prices in the city to decline by as much as 15% in the coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The property price increases that were driven by a constraint in supply will reverse, and Hong Kong's residential price correction will become a multiyear trend," said CLSA analyst Nicole Wong, who expects residential prices will fall as much as 15% in the next 24 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his remarks, Mr. Leung said the city will continue to develop its tourism, one of its pillar industries, though he acknowledged that the crush of tourists—some 35 million from mainland China alone arrived in the territory during 2012—can be taxing. Hong Kong will continue to focus on more infrastructure to accommodate such visitors, with a particular emphasis on attracting high-spending ones, he said. Government officials said Wednesday one way such a policy could be carried out is through the construction of more luxury hotels.</p>

</div><div class="author">Renee Schultes </div><div>408 words</div><div>14 January 2014</div><div>05:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. housing market is never short of a naysayer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the country's largest house builder by volumes, <span class="companylink">Barratt Developments</span>, saw off its critics again Tuesday reporting a 71% surge in forward sales in the second half of last year. For house builders, there are reasons to think the recovery is still off to the races.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, house builder stocks got out of the gate well before the property market started picking up speed, rising by more than 160% over the past two years. The sector now trades on 1.8 times forecast 2014 book value compared with an average of just over two times at historic cyclical peaks, based on Jefferies estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders have ample scope to increase earnings as the recovery gathers momentum. Government-backed programs like Help to Buy, which make mortgages available to buyers with small deposits, have kick-started bank lending, stimulating demand for homes. New mortgage approvals rose by almost a fifth year-over-year in the first 11 months of 2013 but they are still roughly half 2006's peak, according to Bank of England data. Assuming mortgage lending keeps growing, that's a bullish sign for housing-market transactions, which tend to lag mortgage approvals by a few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, house builders are just at the beginning of a run of projects on land bought cheaply over the past four years. Barratt acquired more than 11,000 plots in the second half of last year—22% more than in the same period of 2012. Those were bought at prices on which Barratt expects to make at least 25% returns on capital employed. And although builders can't avoid the prospect of rising costs, particularly labor, selling prices are increasing too: Barratt's rose 13.7% in the last six months of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, even if land values start to rise across the U.K. again, Barratt could always return more capital to shareholders. Suspending land purchases for a year would still leave it with 3½ years' supply and free up £700 million ($1.15 billion) in cash flow to fund a special dividend, notes <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. That's equivalent to just under a fifth of its market capitalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Barratt trading on 1.46 times forecast 2014 book value based on Jefferies estimates, a discount to peers, investors may be champing at the bit for a while yet.</p>

</div><div class="author">James Glynn </div><div>652 words</div><div>13 January 2014</div><div>23:29</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—The Australian dollar is trading close to a one-month high against the U.S. currency, as traders eased bets the country's central bank will continue lowering interest rates in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Aussie has risen in recent days as a raft of domestic data pointed to a strengthening economic recovery, seen as reducing the need for further monetary easing that would exert downward pressure on the local currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, any further rate cuts would risk fueling more gains in house prices—and the central bank has already expressed concern that the housing market, if it continues to rise rapidly, may start overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as December, investors were betting on a 50% chance of one rate cut this year, according to overnight index swaps. The odds have now dropped to about 25%. A few bets are even being placed on a rate increase in 2014, something almost unthinkable last year while data was still mostly patchy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is increasingly pricing out the chances of further rate cuts," said David Forrester, a Singapore-based currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Macquarie Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International factors have also contributed to the Aussie's gains since Friday, particularly the greenback's sharp drop against both the Aussie and yen following the release of weak U.S. employment data last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar traded above parity for much of the past three years, but fell sharply in 2013 to as low as US$0.8000 as speculation grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve would begin tapering its bond-buying program. The gains over the past few days have taken it back above the US$0.9000 level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resumption of the currency's upward trajectory is a concern for the central bank, which has been trying to talk the Aussie down to try and assist the country's struggling exporters, manufacturers in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's eight rate cuts over the past two years have been aimed at spurring nonmining parts of the economy as a long resources boom cools and pushes up unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's economy is closely tied to the fortunes of China, its biggest trading partner, whose slowdown in 2012 set in motion a parallel downturn in the economy from which it is still struggling to recover—even with interest rates at a record low 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economic data—including retail, housing and sentiment measures—are beginning to look more promising, raising confidence a corner may have been turned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some retailers reported record sales over the Christmas period, while a nongovernment survey this month showed new-home sales rose at the fastest pace in almost four years in November, boding well for a pickup in areas such as construction and high-street spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many investors' minds, all of that is diminishing the chances of the central bank's rate-cutting cycle continuing this year, in turn making the Australian dollar look more appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data has surely been a factor" in the Aussie's recent gains, said Sean Callow, a Sydney-based currency strategist at <span class="companylink">Westpac Banking Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the central bank is worried by the pace of gains in house prices, which in major cities rose almost 10% last year as low rates encouraged property investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its concern is that investment housing, rather than buyers looking to move in, is driving the increases, creating the potential risk of a housing crash that would quickly unwind improvements elsewhere in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, currency traders are seeing the chances of central bank rate cuts this year rapidly diminishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in Asia on Tuesday, the Australian dollar was trading at US$0.9035. It traded as high as US$0.9088 in New York on Monday, its highest level since Dec. 11.</p>

</div><div class="author">Jason Douglas </div><div>575 words</div><div>14 January 2014</div><div>05:04</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—The annual rate of inflation in the U.K. fell in December to its lowest level in more than four years, a surprise decline that should reinforce the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s commitment to keep interest rates low to nurture the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said Tuesday that annual inflation in the U.K. fell to the central bank's target of 2% in December from 2.1% in November, the lowest rate since Nov. 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ONS said the fall was driven by a smaller increase than a year earlier in prices for food and beverages, which helped offset bigger gains in prices for household gas and electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected annual inflation to rise to 2.2% in December following price increases in domestic energy bills announced by major suppliers in late 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown should bolster the BOE's determination to keep borrowing costs for households and businesses down to support a strengthening economic rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central-bank officials led by Gov. Mark Carney have pledged to keep the U.K.'s benchmark interest rate at a low of 0.5% as long as inflation is forecast to remain close to the central bank's 2% target. Officials have said they wish to see unemployment drop to 7% before they consider tightening policy. The jobless rate was 7.4% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said Tuesday the fall in inflation should enable officials to keep their benchmark rate stable even after that jobless threshold is met.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unemployment is fast approaching the BOE's 7% threshold for considering a rate hike, but the lack of inflation pressure gives them room to delay a first hike until next year," said Robert Wood, chief U.K. economist at <span class="companylink">Berenberg Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall in U.K. inflation will help ease a squeeze on Britons' incomes, which have suffered in recent years as wage rises have failed into keep pace with price increases. A fall in British living standards is set to be an important battleground between Prime Minister David Cameron's governing coalition and the opposition Labour Party in a general election scheduled for 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in U.K. inflation echoes similar declines in many advanced economies, including the U.S. and euro zone, a reflection of subdued demand and weak commodity prices world-wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further data Tuesday showed other inflationary pressures in the U.K. economy remain contained. Prices charged by companies for their goods at the factory gate rose 1% on the year in December, while the prices firms pay for raw materials fell 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One area where prices are rising quickly is in the property market. ONS data Friday showed house prices were 5.4% higher in November than a year earlier, a slightly smaller gain than in October, when prices rose 5.5% on the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in house prices has sparked fears the U.K. could be at risk of developing a dangerous property bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE officials say they are monitoring the housing market closely and will act to rein in excessively risky lending, perhaps by slapping limits on how much home buyers can borrow or raising bank capital requirements. Raising the BOE's benchmark interest rate will be the last line of defense against any bubble, Mr. Carney has said.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Hannon </div><div>557 words</div><div>14 January 2014</div><div>01:33</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production across the 17 countries that shared the euro in November rose at the fastest pace in 3½ years, an indication that the currency area's economy likely grew for the third straight quarter as 2013 drew to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprisingly strong rise in output from the euro zone's factories removes some doubts about the sustainability of the economic recovery. While business surveys had been positive during the three months through December, hard data had been weak, with industrial production, construction output and retail sales having fallen in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released last week, however, showed retail sales rose at the fastest pace on record in November, and the jump in industrial production suggests it was a strong month for the euro zone's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> expects to see a "gradual" recovery in the euro-zone economy this year, and therefore doesn't expect the inflation rate to weaken much below the 0.8% recorded in December, although it has pledged to act "decisively" if that were to occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking Tuesday, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said growth rates within the currency area will vary in 2014, with Germany and Austria growing by as much as 2.0%, and only Slovenia and Cyprus likely experiencing contractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He echoed ECB President Mario Draghi's assertion that there is no prospect for a period of deflation over either the short or medium term, and said there was no immediate need for the ECB to take action to boost growth and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The modest recovery in growth…in the next few months…supports our view that the ECB is likely to keep its monetary policy stance unchanged," said Violante di Canossa, an economist at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency said industrial output in November was 1.8% higher than in October, and 3% higher than the year-earlier month. This was a stronger outcome than expected, with 26 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last week estimating that output rose 1.4% on the month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures for October were revised higher, and <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> now estimates that output fell 0.8% during the month, having previously calculated they fell 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in output compared with the month earlier was the largest since May 2010, when output jumped 2%. When compared with the year-earlier period, the increase was the largest since August 2011, when output surged 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in industrial production was spread across much of the euro zone, with Germany recording a 2.4% rise, France a 1.4% increase, Spain a 1% rise and Italy a more modest 0.3% increase. Output also rose in Ireland and Portugal, but fell 2.2% in Greece. Estonia was the only other member to record a decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise was also spread across a number of different industries, led by manufacturers of capital goods, and including makers of intermediate and nondurable consumer goods. Manufacture of durable consumer goods fell 0.8%, however, an indication that households haven't yet become confident enough about their prospects to make large purchases, such as of household appliances and cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Latvia became the 18th member of the euro zone at the beginning of this year. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for Swiss property in the medium and lower price sectors quickened again in the fourth quarter, driven by an influx of cash-rich migrants, ultralow financing costs and solid economic growth, but price gains for luxury homes are running out of steam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest quarterly Swiss house price index complied by property consultants Fahrlaender Partner shows the average price of a Swiss condominium gained 3% in the three months through December compared with the previous quarter, while detached house values rose 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment values in the medium and lower price brackets gained 3% from the third quarter, while prices in the luxury sector dropped 1.1%, the index showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates in Switzerland have held at ultralow levels since August 2011, when the <span class="companylink">Swiss National Bank</span> pared its key rate to near zero in a move to curb global investor demand for the franc, seen as a haven from the fiscal problems in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zurich-based central bank has warned repeatedly of the dangers of the Alpine country's housing market overheating and, along with the Swiss financial market regulator, Finma, is monitoring developments in the market closely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February last year, the SNB, backed by the government, triggered its anti-cyclical capital buffer, which requires Swiss banks to hold an extra 1% of mortgage-related, risk-weighted assets to back their lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNB Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine last month said conditions in the Swiss mortgage market have deteriorated in recent months, and this poses the greatest challenge to the stability of the domestically active banks in the medium term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in mortgages for residential property continued to outstrip Swiss gross domestic product growth last year, according to the SNB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In an environment of persistently low interest rates, coupled with banks' undiminished appetite for risk, the danger of a further buildup of imbalances remains considerable," Mr. Danthine said on Dec. 12.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">China to Establish System for Tracking Real Estate Ownership; Nationwide Real Estate Registration System Could Pave Way For Levying Broad Property Tax</span>
</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>554 words</div><div>13 January 2014</div><div>02:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI—China plans to establish a national system for tracking real-estate ownership and sales transactions, a key step in its effort to tame a property sector that threatens to price many Chinese out of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A nationwide real-estate registration system could pave the way for levying a broad property tax in China for the first time. It could also help Beijing crack down on government officials and others who buy and own multiple properties despite restrictions on ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a tough task," said Xu Deming, vice minister of land and resources, at a work meeting on Saturday, according to the ministry's website. China has to carry this out to safeguard the interests of the public and to ensure sustainable economic growth, Mr. Xu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He didn't give details on whether such registrations would include the ownership of commercial property in addition to residential property. Such a system would make it easier for the authorities to detect and tax multiple property ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently there are many local registries and systems that aren't linked, making it difficult to determine who owns what. In November, the State Council, the country's cabinet, said real-estate registration processes that had been supervised by nine government departments would be combined into a single system overseen by the Ministry of Land and Resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials see property taxes as a sustainable solution to control speculation and keep the already large gap between rich and poor from widening. It is currently in place on a trial basis in Shanghai and Chongqing, but policy makers said they would expand it to more cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average housing prices in 100 Chinese cities rose 11.5% in December from the same month a year earlier, according to private data provider <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System. Over the same period, housing prices in Beijing and Shanghai rose 28.3% and 15.6% respectively</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said a property tax could address the issue of empty apartments kept off the rental market. A property tax would give owners of spare properties more incentive to rent them out. Still, they say the thorny issue of privacy has hindered the progress of such efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, court cases of individuals owning multiple properties have also driven calls for more transparency on property ownership. In September, Gong Aiai, nicknamed "Sister House" in China, was sentenced to three years in prison for forging identification documents that allowed her to purchase 44 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same weekend meeting, Jiang Daming, China's minister of land and resources, said farmland and the production of food must not be reduced while carrying out land reforms. The official <span class="companylink">Xinhua</span> news agency said authorities would restrict the purchase of rural land by rural residents, citing Mr. Jiang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a key policy meeting in November, Communist Party leaders said they wanted to make it easier for farmers to transfer their land, with little details so far on how this would be carried out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rural land reform still faces strong opposition at the current stage" said research firm NSBO Beijing. "We do not expect to see large changes for the land system in the short term."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Australia Housing Report Revives Bubble Fears; Low interest rates fueled property market 15% on year in November</span>
</div><div class="author">James Glynn </div><div>547 words</div><div>12 January 2014</div><div>21:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Australia's latest housing data, while promising on the surface, has increased concern the market may be overheating, posing a potential threat to a still fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government report Monday showed the value of home loans approved in Australia rose 1.1% in November from October and 15% from a year earlier, confirming that record-low interest rates are continuing to fuel demand for houses and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the data also highlighted two trends that policy makers will be less thrilled about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the rise in the value of mortgages approved continues to be driven by people looking to invest in property, rather than those seeking to move into houses or apartments. Second, first-home buyers are increasingly being frozen out of a market in which house prices have hit record highs in some large cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While owner-occupier demand is intensifying, investor demand is surging well ahead," said Janu Chan, a Sydney-based economist at St. George Bank in a note to clients, pointing out that investor loans for housing exceeded 30% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the participation of first-home buyers in the figures fell to 12.3%, the lowest level in more than two decades—suggesting the bottom rung of the housing ladder is becoming less stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worry is that rising residential property prices alongside strong investment buying and falling demand from first-home buyers may eventually pull the rug from under the market, cause a crash and derail Australia's nascent recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is the problem," said Paul Brennan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> in Australia, based in Sydney. "Mortgage sizes are rising consistent with the rise in prices and it is getting to a point now where first-home buyers can't get their loan deposit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to research group RP Data-Rismark, home values in capital cities rose by almost 10% last year. Sydney, the country's largest property market, jumped close to 15%, while property prices in Melbourne and Perth also made strong advances. The pace of the increases has fanned fears of an emerging asset-price bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has been trying to give the housing market a lift with record-low interest rates aimed at cushioning the economy from the end of a long mining boom. The idea is to spur nonmining sectors of the economy such as construction, retail and manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, last year the central bank itself raised concern that the sharp increase in home buying for investment purposes was a worrying trend that may need to be reined in at some point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some don't regard the falling proportion of first-home buyers in the latest mortgage data as anything too serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shane Garrett, a senior economist at the Housing Industry Association, an umbrella group for the nation's main home builders, said that with the benchmark interest rate likely to stay at 2.5% for some time, new-home buyers would eventually return to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing investors first off the starting line, and first-home buyers are probably lagging behind that," Mr. Garrett said. "First-home buyers are usually the last group to act."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—U.K. factory output was weaker than expected and construction output fell in November, official data showed Friday, suggesting Britain's economic recovery may have slowed in the final quarter of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said factory output was flat between October and November as weaker production of cars and drugs offset higher output of steel, plastics and food products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall industrial output was also flat between October and November, held back by a fall in production of propane, butane and similar products from the North Sea, the ONS said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had predicted British manufacturing output would rise 0.4%, lifting overall industrial production 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Britain's construction sector also reported a poor month, with output falling 4% between October and November, dragged down by a fall in both new building and maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown at Britain's factories and the decline in construction follows poor Christmas trading reported by several large retailers this week and data showing Britain's trade deficit with the rest of the world remains stubbornly wide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures may spark concern among Britain's policy makers that the nation's economic recovery is far from assured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data hurt sterling, pushing the pound as low as $1.6403 Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These monthly figures are disappointing. It is a timely reminder that the recovery is not yet secure," said David Kern, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">British Chambers of Commerce</span>, a business group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. economy expanded between 0.8% between the second and third quarters of 2013—an annualized rate of 3.2%. A preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter growth will be published by the ONS on Jan. 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said Britain's services sector, which accounts for roughly three-quarters of economic output, will need to put in a strong performance in the final months of 2013 if the recent pace of expansion is to be maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Archer, chief U.K. and European economist at IHS Global Insight, on Friday cut his estimate for fourth-quarter growth in the U.K. to 0.7% from 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's data will reinforce <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> officials' determination to keep borrowing costs for businesses and households low to nurture recovery, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOE rate-setters on Thursday left the central bank's benchmark interest rate at a low of 0.5% and its bond-buying program untouched, maintaining their support for the economy. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Industry Boosts Euro Zone; But British Factory Output Surprisingly Flat</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Hannon </div><div>658 words</div><div>10 January 2014</div><div>05:09</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial output in three of the euro zone's largest members rebounded strongly in November, according to official data, indicating that the currency area's economy was on track for a third straight quarter of growth as 2013 drew to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures also released Friday showed British factories didn't share in that pickup, with output surprisingly flat during the month, an indication that the U.K.'s recent growth advantage over its eurozone counterparts may be narrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While business surveys have indicated that the euro-zone economy continued to expand in the fourth quarter, official figures had raised some doubts. In particular, figures for October recorded a drop in industrial production, construction output and retail sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s official statistics agency will release figures for industrial production in the euro zone during November on Jan. 14. Releases Thursday and Friday from national agencies in Germany, France, and Spain suggest they will record a pickup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revival in industry will help reassure policy makers that the still-fragile recovery was sustained through the final months of last year. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi Thursday said that while the economy continued to show signs of "broad-based weakness," it was nonetheless on the mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While developments in industrial production data for October point to a weak start to the fourth quarter, survey-based confidence indicators up to December have improved further from low levels, overall indicating a continuation of the gradual recovery in economic activity," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">French statistics agency Insee said Friday industrial production in the euro zone's second-largest economy rose 1.3% in November from the previous month, while Spanish agency INE said industrial production in the currency area's fourth-largest economy rose by 1.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That followed a release from <span class="companylink">Germany's economics ministry</span> Thursday that recorded a 1.9% jump in output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Violante di Canossa, an economist at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, said those figures suggest the euro-zone economy grew at an annualized rate of 1% in the fourth quarter, a pickup from the 0.4% rate of growth recorded in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a member of the EU, Sweden has chosen to remain outside the euro zone. Data released Friday showed it recorded an even larger rise in industrial production during November, a 5.7% rise from October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said that partly reflected the reopening of a large oil refinery in southern Sweden, but suggests the economy may be picking up after a period of weakness that included a 0.1% expansion in the third quarter following a 0.1% contraction in the second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We see today's outcome as a sign of a brewing recovery in the manufacturing and service sector, and confirm our forecast of 0.5%…growth…in 4Q GDP," said Tina Mortensen, an economist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, figures released by the <span class="companylink">U.K.'s Office for National Statistics</span> showed factory output was flat between October and November, while construction output fell 4% between October and November. Ms. di Canossa said that suggests growth in the fourth quarter "could be comparatively soft."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.K. economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter, equivalent to an annualized rate of 3.2%. The National Institute for Economic Research—an independent research body—Friday estimated the economy grew by 0.7% in the three months through December. NIESR's estimates have proved accurate in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Friday, <span class="companylink">the Bank of France</span> said its monthly business survey indicates the French economy will rebound in the last quarter of 2013 after a contraction in the third quarter as predicted previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December business survey showed the French gross domestic product will grow 0.5% in the fourth quarter from the third, when it contracted 0.1%. The forecast is in unchanged from <span class="companylink">the Bank of France</span>'s previous estimates for the quarter.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Data Bode Well for Australia's Economy; New-Home Sales Rise at Fastest Pace in Almost Four Years, Bolstering Hopes of a Broader Recovery</span>
</div><div class="author">James Glynn </div><div>413 words</div><div>9 January 2014</div><div>19:56</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—For Australian policy makers looking for evidence of a sustainable economic recovery, the latest data on sales of newly built homes will come as a relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government report Friday showed new-home sales rose at the fastest pace in almost four years in November, boding well for a broader recovery dependent on a pickup in areas such as construction and high-street spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, the more new homes that are sold, the greater the need for occupants to buy furniture, carpets and other household goods. Also, the more solid the demand for new houses and apartments, the more work there is for the nation's builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is exactly the virtuous circle policy makers in the resource-rich nation are hoping to create to offset a slowing mining boom after more than a year of lackluster economic performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has cut interest rates eight times in the past two years to a record-low 2.5% to help other sectors take up the slack from the resource industry, which lost thousands of jobs as China's economy slowed and major mining projects reached or neared completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's data from the Housing Industry Association, an umbrella group for the nation's major home builders, showed new home sales jumped 7.5% in November from October. It was the biggest monthly increase since January 2010, and the latest indication that the low interest rates are in fact fueling a recovery in the nonmining economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to see upward momentum in these leading indicators continue throughout 2014," said Harley Dale, HIA's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market overall had runaway success last year, with prices nationally rising at the fastest pace in more than three years. The sharp rises have created some of the most expensive property in the world, but have fanned concern the market may be overheating and that a sudden crash might undo a still-fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, recent data have helped ease worries that the house-price gains are wildly disproportionate to improvements elsewhere in the Australian economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the latest new-home-sales figures, a government report Thursday showed retail sales climbed for the seventh month in a row in November, while measures of business and consumer confidence also showed significant gains last year.</p>
