<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors put U.K. home-builder stocks back on the ladder well before a recovery in the housing market. The sector's shares have soared more than 80% over the past 12 months, while average house prices are still 11% below 2007's peak, according to Nationwide. But if the government's Help-To-Buy mortgage initiatives announced in March stimulate demand for new homes, the outlook for builders could be brighter than investors credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have blamed the stagnant housing market on a lack of mortgage credit, which has more than halved since 2007. Loans to buyers with 5% deposits—many of which are first-time-buyers—have dropped 97%, according to the <span class="companylink">Council of Mortgage Lenders</span>. As a result, new home starts are close to the lowest peacetime level on record. But the government's new shared equity scheme, where it will lend up to 20% of the value of a property, has the capacity to fund 87,500 new home sales over the next three years, estimates <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. That's 60% of the current output of listed home builders. Mortgage guarantees on both new and existing homes could lead to another 542,000 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, uncertainty around jobs and economic growth could still dent buyer confidence. But banks report rising demand for mortgages. And housing has become relatively more affordable because prices have fallen faster than household income in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Provided property sales pick up, house prices might rise by an average 2.1% a year between 2014 and 2016, forecasts <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>. Whereas property slumps in Ireland and parts of the U.S. were proceeded by a construction boom, growth in the number of households in the U.K. has exceeded new home completions since around 2008. And even modest price inflation could be material: For each percentage point rise, pre-tax profits would grow 13.1% at Barratt Development's and 10.6% at <span class="companylink">Taylor Wimpey</span>, notes <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, with home builders trading on a roughly 40% premium to forecast 2013 net asset value based on <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> estimates, some of that is already in the price. But the sector has traded on an even bigger premium this early in previous recoveries: <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> values the sector on a 73% premium. That suggests home builders haven't hit the ceiling yet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin in New York and Lingling Wei in Beijing </div><div>1172 words</div><div>17 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> is upping the ante in Asia, looking to raise the largest real-estate fund ever devoted to the region at a time when economic growth there shows signs of slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private-equity giant, which has become one of the world's biggest real-estate investors, plans to raise up to a $4 billion real-estate fund exclusively focused on China and other Asian markets, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target amount for the fund, which will be <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s first devoted to Asia, is twice what the firm initially indicated it intended to raise. It also would be the largest Asia property fund raised, according to data tracker Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> believes there is opportunity because property values have fallen in many Asian countries as economies have cooled, say people familiar with its thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Asia fund is another sign that investors are willing to venture into emerging markets in search for yield, as interest rates are near rock bottom. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> also may have sensed an opportunity in a region that many of its rivals have avoided, approached cautiously or pulled out of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's not a whole lot of competition out there," said Timothy Walsh, director of the council that manages New Jersey's state pension fund, which last month committed $500 million to the new Blackstone Asia fund. "Just a few niche guys."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment on the new fund or fundraising in Asia. The firm is expected to provide some details about the Asia fund during its first-quarter earnings call on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Asian economies are among the fastest-growing in the world, offering a strong foundation for rising commercial-property prices, recent economic data has been less encouraging. Beijing said on Monday that gross domestic product growth slowed to 7.7% year over year in the first quarter. Economists say slower China growth could have a negative ripple effect throughout the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big U.S. pension funds that are investors in <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s global funds say they aren't ready to commit to a new fund that focuses entirely on property in Asia. "We don't need to be pioneers," said Dennis MacKee, spokesman for the Florida organization that manages that state's pension fund, which has invested in two <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> real-estate funds. "We're a little more cautious."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some Asian real-estate executives already are predicting <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> will meet its fundraising goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Three billion dollars to $4 billion is not a difficult target for <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> in Asia," said Collin Lau, former head of real estate for <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., the country's sovereign-wealth fund, who now runs Hong Kong-based investment firm Bei Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, executives at <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> have been saying Asian real estate has great potential. "It's a very important initiative for us to become the most active, opportunistic real-estate investor in Asia," said Stephen Schwarzman, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s chairman, in a January earnings call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar to its global and European funds, the new Asia fund will have flexibility to invest equity in all types of properties and to buy debt, say people who have been briefed on the fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> generally doesn't comment on its real estate-fund returns, but according to a memo from the New Jersey pension fund, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is projecting a net annual return of 18% for its $13.3 billion global fund that concluded fundraising last year. That fund also is investing in Asian real estate. The private-equity firm is projecting a 12% return for its global fund that completed raising money near the peak of the market in 2007, according to New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several private-equity firms have stumbled in the region. In China, for instance, some foreign investors made aggressive bets on the country's luxury housing market in the past few years, only to get burned after the government moved to rein in excessive speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fund run by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Asset Management</span>, for example, lost a high-end apartment building in the Chinese city of Dalian to foreclosure last summer after sluggish sales put the firm in violation of loan covenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some firms have exited or scaled back in the region. <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. sold the former <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> Asian real-estate assets to <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> in 2010, while <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. sold its Asian real-estate investment platform to <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management</span>. <span class="companylink">American International Group Inc</span>. sold its Asian fund business to Invesco in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In India, Apollo is in arbitration over one of the deals it inherited from <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>: an $80 million investment in Delhi developer <span class="companylink">BPTP Ltd</span>. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> had expected to exit its investment through an initial public offering but wasn't able to do that when the IPO market soured. The two sides now are disputing how <span class="companylink">BPTP</span> should go about selling assets to repay Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even U.S. firms that recently raised or are rolling out pan-Asian funds aren't attempting anything on the same scale as <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>. <span class="companylink">Angelo Gordon &amp; Co</span>., of New York, closed a $616 million Asian property fund. <span class="companylink">AEW Capital Management</span>, a Boston-based real-estate investor, is raising a $500 million fund that will invest in major Asian cities, such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul. <span class="companylink">LaSalle Investment Management</span> in Chicago is looking to raise $750 million to invest in Asian property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> began buying Asian real estate in 2006 but made equity investments of only about $102 million over its first three years in the region, according to the New Jersey memo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2010, as Asia emerged from the global economic downturn, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has stepped up the pace, making about $1.5 billion in equity investments in Asian property. It now has 48 people real-estate professionals in the region, a staff roughly the same size as it has in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One high-profile deal involves its purchase in late 2012 of a grade-A office and five-star hotel complex in downtown Shanghai from a distressed local developer. The Huamin Imperial Building, valued by Savills Research &amp; Consultancy at $287 million at that time, was 95% complete, and <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> planned to finish the construction and lease it out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> sees more opportunity now because prices have been declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average housing prices in China rose 3.9% in March from a year earlier, according to China Real Estate Index System, a private data provider. The rate of growth picked up from 0.18% a year earlier. But home prices in certain smaller cities have been declining since the start of 2012 as a result of government property-tightening measures and overbuilding.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>943 words</div><div>17 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael Bloomberg's commitment to sticking with the waterfront following superstorm Sandy will be tested as the city tries to develop a roughly 80-acre site with more than 1,000 new housing units in Far Rockaway, one of the worst-hit areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, which owns the Arverne East site, and developers on Tuesday announced a design competition for architects, engineers, landscapers and urban planners. They are being asked to come up with ideas about how to develop a sustainable waterfront community that will be resilient in the face of future storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials said their goal is to apply the ideas to other large development sites near the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the concerns raised by Sandy, at least two other large waterfront developments have moved forward since the storm: Two Trees Management Co. released plans for the Domino Sugar site, and the city and developers broke ground on the first phase of the Hunter's Point South project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are a coastal city . . . . Either we are going to stop developing or we are going to embrace coastal development. We don't see that stopping coastal development is an option. We are going to continue with it and do in a way that is responsible," said Mathew Wambua, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up to four semifinalists in the contest, which also is being run by the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter and Enterprise Community Partners, will receive $30,000 prizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those teams will be selected by late October, near the anniversary of Sandy, for another $30,000 prize, and to participate in planning the development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are significant challenges associated with preparing the site for future storms. For example, the site might need to be elevated as much as seven feet, said Ron Moelis, a principal at L+M Development Partners and one of the developers of Arverne East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moelis said in an interview in February that the storm raised questions about whether it made sense to build on the site, one of the largest undeveloped city-owned tracts in the five boroughs. But Mr. Moelis said he believes the development could be a model for more resilient waterfront development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do you write off neighborhoods of the city? I don't think we've taken that approach in New York City very often," he said. "The idea is to get everyone's attention and make this a bigger story of sustainability and building on the ocean."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city previously has used design competitions to generate excitement around challenging projects, such as a contest five years ago to design and develop a low- and moderate-income housing development for the 21st century in the Bronx. That contest produced the successful Via Verde project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody gets really excited about competitions," Mr. Wambua said. But he added that the goals of the competition are broader than moving forward with the development, which still faces significant funding challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not defining success for this specific competition necessarily as a groundbreaking date for Arverne East, but how many great ideas we can generate in terms of resiliency," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">L+M, along with the Bluestone Organization and Triangle Equities, already won a competition to develop the site in November 2006. But that project stalled when the recession hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moelis said he hopes the increased public investment in the neighborhood after the storm could include city or state funding for the project's infrastructure, which he expects to cost $80 million to $120 million. Mr. Wambua said the city wants the developers to pick up the tab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arverne East is part of a larger, 308-acre urban-renewal project by the city that also includes the nearby Arverne by the Sea project, which consisted primarily of two- and three-family middle-income homes and fared relatively well throughout the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials said the attention on the Rockaways after Sandy has been a welcome development in an area they say has often been neglected by the city. "Rockaway up until recently served as Siberia for the city of New York," said Jonathan Gaska, district manager for the local community board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the storm, its roads were in poor condition and few small businesses existed. Moreover, access to Manhattan can require a crawling, 90-minute trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storm has made many of those problems worse. Most of the grocery stores in the area are still closed and may never reopen. New flood maps being developed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> could lead the city to require that hundreds of new buildings in the area be elevated above the 100-year flood plain, and could cause insurance premiums to go up. That will create new barriers to development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents and officials say that rather than pulling back on the area, the city and state should invest heavily in bolstering the community with more jobs, better infrastructure and new development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Sen. James Sanders, who until recently was the City Council member for the area, said he supports offering buyouts to some people who live in the most vulnerable areas, but said the community of about 100,000 permanent residents is overwhelmingly committed to staying and rebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I live in the Rockaways. My house was impacted. I am not retreating," Mr. Sanders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "I do believe in planned growth. We should grow in areas that are safe. We should not grow in areas that cannot be defended."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Crest Nicholson Holdings PLC</span> built 1,882 homes across the U.K. in 2012. A Property Report article on Wednesday incorrectly said that it built 1,182 homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the U.S. housing market recovering, some investors are looking across the Atlantic for opportunities in the U.K. housing market, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. investors contributed more than 50% of the GBP 200 million ($307 million) raised last month in an initial public offering by <span class="companylink">Countrywide PLC</span>, the U.K.'s largest residential brokerage, according to people who worked on the deal. Oaktree Capital Management LLC is now a majority shareholder of Countrywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, home builder <span class="companylink">Crest Nicholson Holdings PLC</span>, which listed in February, counts U.S.-based <span class="companylink">Varde Partners</span> as its biggest shareholder. Crest, which built 1,182 homes across the U.K. in 2012, raised GBP 224.9 million in its IPO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since their respective offerings, Countrywide shares are trading up about 23% and <span class="companylink">Crest Nicholson</span>'s are nearly 40% higher. In the past two months, the FTSE 250 index is up just over 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent successful IPOs have highlighted a growing belief in a resurgence in the U.K. residential sector. In the past four years, with the economy dragging, the number people who own their own homes in the U.K. has fallen by 200,000, to 14.4 million, according to data from the <span class="companylink">Office of National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the number of home sales in the U.K. is expected to rise to one million this year as incomes edge higher and government programs improve the availability of mortgages, according to research by <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is still below the 1.3 million deals in the precrisis years but significantly higher than the average 700,000 transactions that have taken place since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who are bullish on the U.K. housing market also point to the scarcity of land in the U.K. and to an overall shortage of housing. In 2011, 390,000 new households were formed, while only 134,900 additional homes were brought into use, according to the <span class="companylink">Institute for Public Policy Research</span>, a center-left U.K. think tank. Investors also are encouraged by a growing number of people who are buying homes with plans to rent them out in so-called buy-to-let strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The supply/demand imbalance is really attractive," said Nael Khatoun, a managing director of Oaktree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, institutions have struggled to find ways to invest in the U.K. residential market. A few firms such as Oaktree and <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management LLC</span> have gambled on the eventual revival of the sector for a number of years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most have been deterred because the sector has been fragmented among many regional players and has lacked the levels of transparency and professionalism seen in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recent IPOs have begun to open up the market to institutions, as has the growing number of distressed asset sales by U.K. banks. Oaktree also recently completed the purchase of <span class="companylink">Countryside Properties</span>, a U.K. home builder, from <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group PLC</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes, momentum around a sector is the most important thing, and there's positive momentum now," said Bill Hughes, managing director of Legal &amp; General Property, which manages assets valued at GBP 10.4 billion and recently bought a stake in Scottish home builder <span class="companylink">CALA Group Ltd</span>., its first direct investment in the U.K. residential market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors also are paying increasing attention to the rental-apartment sector in the U.K. In the past four years, the number of people living in rentals has increased 23% to 3.8 million, according to the <span class="companylink">U.K. Office of National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That sector is coming of age," Mr. Hughes said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Fight for Hip Hotel Firm --- Supermarket Magnate Spars With Mall Family, Fund Executive Over Morgans</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson  </div><div>944 words</div><div>17 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company that pioneered the boutique hotel concept has become the spoils of a battle between two big names in investing and real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgans Hotel Group Co</span>. has its roots in a trendy Manhattan hotel by the same name that was opened in 1984 by nightclub impresarios Ian Schrager and the late Steve Rubell. The stylishly furnished 154-room hotel, which Morgans still manages, was so popular among big name entertainers and fashionistas that it didn't have the need for commercial signage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgans, based in New York, has since expanded into a chain of 13 trendy hotels, including the Delano South Beach in Miami Beach, Fla., and the Mondrian SoHo in Manhattan. But in recent years, it has faced competition from other hotels that have poured into the boutique category, and it has struggled with the $552 million of debt it took on to finance its properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That set the stage for the fight. On one side is supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, whose <span class="companylink">Yucaipa Cos</span>. is Morgans's largest creditor. On the other is an investment group led by hedge-fund executive Michael Olshan and the Taubman family of luxury mall owner <span class="companylink">Taubman Centers Inc</span>. That group, called OTK Associates LLC, is Morgans's largest shareholder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schrager left the company in 2005. Mr. Rubell, who co-owned New York disco Studio 54 with Mr. Schrager, died in 1989.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The battle is over Mr. Burkle's plan to recapitalize Morgans as it shifts from owning hotels to managing them. The plan, which is supported by Morgans's board, calls for transferring to Yucaipa the Delano South Beach hotel and the company's Light Group food and beverage subsidiary. In exchange, Yucaipa would retire roughly $187 million in preferred shares and convertible notes, retire warrants and assume an $18 million promissory note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan also calls for Morgans to raise $100 million by selling stock to existing shareholders at $6 a share. Yucaipa has agreed to backstop the program, meaning it will buy any stock that isn't purchased by other holders. A Yucaipa representative declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTK wants to block that plan, alleging that it might allow Yucaipa to gain control of Morgans if Yucaipa ends up buying much of the new stock Morgans intends to issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTK began buying Morgans stock in 2008, when the stock traded as high as $19.75, and it now holds a 13.9% stake. Morgans shares were at $6.27, up 17 cents, in 4 p.m. trading on the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq Stock Market</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An OTK spokesman said the firm's principals had become frustrated in recent years with Morgans's failings, which included forfeiting two hotels to lenders during the real-estate bust, losing management contracts, incurring annual net losses since 2004 and a drop from the stock's 2008 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTK made its move publicly last month, announcing that it intends to propose seven candidates to replace Morgans's nine-member board. Its nominees include OTK principals and a few hotel-industry experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Olshan said in an interview that, without the right industry expertise, Morgans is missing out on the boutique-hotel industry's growth. "One of our concerns is that, without the right team to capitalize on that growth, there is an enormous opportunity in which the company is at risk of not profitably participating," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgans, headed by Yucaipa veteran Michael Gross as chief executive since 2011, is remaking itself into a hotel manager, divesting its hotels and keeping contracts to manage them for the new owners. The company has cinched deals to start managing another eight hotels under its brands in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morgans's announcement of the recapitalization deal with Yucaipa came roughly two weeks after OTK went public with its concerns. However, a Morgans spokesman said the Yucaipa deal was in the works for months, and OTK knew about it because an OTK principal, Jason Taubman Kalisman, is on Morgans's board and sat on the board committee evaluating the Yucaipa deal and other alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTK "had multiple opportunities to express interest and take more of a leadership role," the spokesman said. "And they never did. Instead, they're attempting to take control of the board without any compensation to shareholders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kalisman and OTK reacted to the Yucaipa deal by immediately filing a derivative lawsuit pending in Delaware Chancery Court that seeks to block the deal. A hearing in that case is set for May 13. Meanwhile, Morgans's annual shareholder meeting is set for July 10. The company shifted its schedule for selling the $100 million of new stock to shareholders so that the program's results won't affect voting at the July meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTK's origins go back four decades, when Mr. Olshan's father, Mort Olshan, and Taubman family patriarch, A. Alfred Taubman, built the Fair Oaks Mall in Fairfax, Va. The next generation now oversees OTK, with Michael Olshan and Robert Taubman as managing principals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Olshan's O-CAP Management LP oversees several hundred million dollars of assets. Robert Taubman is chairman and chief executive of Taubman Centers, owner of 27 upscale malls. Robert Taubman says OTK isn't an activist investor. "We've tried to work with successive managements [at Morgans] and be a constructive force in their efforts," he said in an interview. "We've only gone to these lengths because we felt we needed to."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Krouse </div><div>784 words</div><div>17 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the austerity mood in Washington, President Obama's proposed budget would provide tax relief to some foreign investors, a move the U.S. real-estate industry has been seeking for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of a larger push to spur private investment in U.S. infrastructure, Mr. Obama has proposed changes to a 1980s tax policy called the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, or Firpta, that would exempt foreign pension funds from paying taxes on gains from real-estate sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal is still subject to congressional approval, which will likely prove tricky in the current budget-cutting climate. It also doesn't go as far as the real-estate industry would like because the proposed exemption would only apply to overseas pension funds, not all foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is the first time Mr. Obama has included a Firpta change in a budget. If the change is approved, it likely would lead to an increase in U.S. investments by foreign pension funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a pension investor who is looking around the world thinking, 'I want a global portfolio,' quite often the Firpta has stopped them filling in that North American piece," said Paul Richards, head of European property at consulting firm Mercer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed exemption would cost $2.2 billion over the next 10 years, according to the 2014 budget, and is part of a larger package of incentives for infrastructure investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firpta had led a number of investors to change their strategies to investing in real-estate debt in the U.S. rather than equity, said Ben Sanderson of Hermes Real Estate Investment Management Ltd., which manages money for pension funds. "It's not a barrier that makes it entirely impossible to invest, but [investing in the U.S. would be] more attractive if it was reformed," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Firpta taxes gains from foreign sales of assets including buildings, land, mines and timber, as well as stock in real-estate companies. While foreign investors consider it onerous, many still invest in the U.S. because of its clear legal system and a transparent property market, where price and performance data is easy to obtain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, foreign pension-fund investments accounted for just 1% of the total $267.12 billion in U.S. commercial real-estate deals completed last year, according to data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield and <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Overseas pension funds represented the same percentage of the total investment volume in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deals by foreign investors as a whole represented 7% of total deal volume in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-profile transactions by foreign pension funds in 2012 included the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>'s $1.8 billion investment in a joint venture with Westfield Group that included interests in 10 regional U.S. malls and two redevelopment sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Second Swedish National Pension Fund</span>, a $37.64 billion fund, made its first investment in U.S. commercial real estate last year as part of a push to diversify its portfolio. The fund paid $325 million for a 41% stake in US Office Holdings, a company owned by South Korea's <span class="companylink">National Pension Service</span> and <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties LP</span>. The Swedish fund had invested 7.5% of its portfolio in real estate throughout the world in 2012, according to its latest annual report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Kanters, managing director of global real estate at APG Asset Management, the fund manager that invests 329 billion euros ($428.9 billion) for pension funds including Dutch civil-service pension fund ABP, said the group had been investing in U.S. real estate since the late 1990s, but that the proposed change was a "great idea" that would set a more-level playing field for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that today, domestic buyers in the U.S. are able to place higher bids in competitive tenders for properties because their future internal rates of return, or IRR, aren't affected by the added tax on future capital gains. "They can pay slightly more to get the same IRR," Mr. Kanters said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Fetgatter, chief executive of the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate, said the move to revise the law showed investors for the first time that the White House understands the impact of Firpta. "The fact that the president acknowledged that Firpta regulations are an impediment to foreign investment, that's a significant step for it to be publicly acknowledged, and from such a high level," Mr. Fetgatter said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Zibel                And Jeffrey Sparshott </div><div>506 words</div><div>16 April 2013</div><div>10:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—New-home construction leapt last month to the highest level since before the financial crisis, driven by a big gain in the volatile multifamily-home segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes with at least five units rose about 27% in March from a month earlier, to the highest level since January 2006, while single-family homes were down 4.8% on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's figures for the multifamily sector tend to be volatile. But analysts see continued strength for the apartment market, especially as many families have damaged credit and are locked out from buying homes for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The processing of foreclosed and delinquent properties is transitioning many households away from homeownership and into rentership, which accounts for the relative strength of multi-family starts over single family starts," wrote Michael Gapen, an economist with <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts cautioned against being overly concerned about the decline in single-family construction, especially since the previous month's figures were the highest since May 2008. The data "do not alter the overall picture of single-family new construction activity, which continues to recover gradually," analysts at RBS Securities Inc. wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists largely believe improvements in the housing market will be a bright spot for the tepid economic recovery this year. Investments in residential projects and home improvements have contributed to overall economic growth for seven consecutive quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing starts rose 7% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.04 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The figures were the strongest since June 2008. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast housing starts would rise 1.7% to a rate of 933,000. February's figures were revised sharply upward to a rate of 968,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of new building permits, an indication of future construction, fell 3.9% to an annualized rate of 902,000 in March. That was below economists' estimates for a rate of 945,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, builders' ability to get construction loans and higher costs for building materials could slow construction in the coming months. On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said its members' confidence fell in April for the third straight month and was at its lowest level since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government data showed new home building rose in three out of our U.S. regions last month. Construction rose 10.9% in the South, 9.6% in the Midwest and 2.7% in the West, but fell 5.8% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, which are calculated without seasonal adjustments, increased to 85,800 in March from a upwardly revised 66,300 for the prior month. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1508 words</div><div>16 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Christine Quinn's signature pitches as she runs for New York City mayor is a housing plan that would create 80,000 new low-cost apartments with prices that potentially could stay below-market rate forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Council speaker's proposal for so-called permanent affordable housing is attracting resistance from many low-cost housing advocates, who say it would make some types of buildings harder to finance and result in fewer units overall. But one of the groups has become the plan's most active supporter. The Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development has lobbied city officials on the issue and produced a series of reports warning of the dangers of losing cheap apartments, laying out the benefits of permanently affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit group, which has publicly supported permanently affordable housing for several years, requested $100,000 in city funds for each of the past three years to advocate for the issue, and the funds were granted by Ms. Quinn, according to the speaker's office. A contract with the city says the group -- a registered lobbyist that has an operating budget of about $1 million -- must use the money to "convince the state and city to incorporate permanent affordability" into government housing policy -- the idea on which Ms. Quinn is campaigning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Civic groups said the use of city money to support public advocacy by a lobbyist is unusual. The grant, also known as a member item, was drawn from a pot of less than $17 million in 2012 over which the speaker has sole discretion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funding generally is given to groups that provide services to the poor, the elderly and children, including Citymeals-on-Wheels and the <span class="companylink">Brooklyn Children's Museum</span> last year. The funding was voted on as a block by the full council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not typical of discretionary-funding projects to have a more advocacy angle. . . . What's different is that this is for advocacy more than for direct services," said Rachael Fauss of Citizens Union, a nonprofit group that closely observes city and state budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benjamin Dulchin, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development's executive director, defended his organization's use of the money, saying it also was used to do policy research. Its reports are available to all city officials and the public. "Putting a position out there is what we do. We are proud of the fact that we took permanent affordability from a pipe dream to something that people saw as realistic and implementable," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn, a Manhattan Democrat, declined an interview request. Jamie McShane, a spokesman for the speaker's office, said it isn't unprecedented for funds to be given to groups that advocate on public issues. He pointed to the Council of Senior Centers and Services of New York City, which received a $20,000 member item this year to run workshops and training for the nonprofit group's providers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McShane said the City Council has given grants to groups that have concerns about funding permanent affordable housing, including <span class="companylink">New York University</span>'s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, which received $45,000 in the budget this year to help maintain a database of the city's privately owned affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANHD spends about $3,900 a month to lobby City Council members, the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development and state officials on permanent affordable housing, according to Mr. Dulchin and the group's lobbying disclosure filings with the city. Most of the group's funding comes from foundations, not the government, according to Mr. Dulchin and the group's tax filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn's first job in the city was as an ANHD tenant organizer, and she worked for the group in the late '80s and early '90s. Her early years as a housing advocate have bolstered her reputation as an advocate for the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1974, the association represents 94 primarily small nonprofit neighborhood housing groups. Over the years, it has supported Ms. Quinn's controversial proposal to require developers to publicly report employees' wages and has also put forward a proposal that has become a campaign plank of hers -- a fund to buy distressed apartment buildings, make repairs and sell them to affordable housing developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue now is Ms. Quinn's plan for "permanent affordable housing," a proposal that Mr. Dulchin said his group helped draft. It would depart from three decades of city housing policy, developers and advocates said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most government subsidies for the city's privately built affordable housing have an expiration date -- typically about 30 years. To construct apartment buildings that are mostly or all below-market rate, developers generally must demonstrate to banks and investors that the projects will become more profitable at a later date, said Ron Moelis, a principal at L+M Development Partners, a company that develops market-rate and affordable housing. Mr. Moelis and others note that is particularly true for the kind of middle-income housing Ms. Quinn is pushing for, which usually requires more capital from banks and private investors. Further, buildings generally become more expensive to maintain after 30 years, and landlords need higher, market-rate rents to pay for those expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary affordable housing was the idea behind most of the roughly 200,000 apartment units that former Mayor Ed Koch oversaw in the 1980s, and has underpinned much of the Bloomberg administration's drive to create or preserve 160,000 affordable units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn's plan would, through state legislation, create a new city tax credit for affordable housing developments and require developers who receive the subsidy to renew the below-market rate aspects of their buildings every 30 years, at the city's request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city has right of first refusal to do that. If they put those incentives in place, the developer would be required to extend affordability," said Rafael Cestero, a former commissioner of the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development who is supportive of Ms. Quinn's middle-class housing plan. He now runs the <span class="companylink">Community Preservation Corp</span>., which focuses on rehabilitating affordable buildings in lower-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said this proposal would apply to most affordable units being constructed in the city and would help address a key issue he faced as commissioner, when the city had to negotiate with developers on a piecemeal basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McShane said the city has "watched too many units of affordable housing disappear because they were not permanently protected."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Her plan creates new, innovative tools that will allow hard-working people to continue to live and work in New York without fear that the place they call home will one day be out of reach," Mr. McShane said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn has said the middle-income apartments would rent for about $2,300 a month -- roughly the rent affordable to a family of four making about $112,000 a year. Mr. Dulchin said the speaker's plan would give the city flexibility. Rents could go up for some units after 30 years, but others in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods could remain low-priced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANHD's advocacy has helped Ms. Quinn's plan gain support from politicians and community groups that don't specialize in housing. The Bloomberg administration is expected to create more than 6,000 permanently affordable units, including in large development projects such as Hudson Yards and Seward Park. Almost all of the Democratic mayoral candidates expressed support for permanent affordability at a mayoral forum Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal has set off a debate among developers of low-cost housing. While it would help the smaller nonprofit organizations that make up ANHD's membership, it also would aid the city's largest real-estate firms that prefer to build housing that is only partially affordable and mostly market rate, some housing advocates said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerilyn Perine, executive director of Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a nonprofit group, said Ms. Quinn's plan could result in fewer below-market apartments and would hurt for-profit developers that build units that are all or mostly affordable because they may not be able to get as much financing. She and others said it could end up costing the city money if banks invest less money and refuse to pay for repairs to aging infrastructure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a lot of developers, they'll say, 'Great, I won't put any of my money in. I'll just keep going back to the government.' I don't know if that's really what we want," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moelis said the ability to convert an affordable development in Chelsea or Park Slope to higher rents is a key incentive for the private sector to build middle-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you make something permanently affordable . . . then you're giving up any future hope," said Mr. Moelis. "You're giving up the capitalist side of it."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anjali Athavaley </div><div>852 words</div><div>15 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Silverstein has long been known as the Energizer Bunny of New York real-estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after 60 years in the business, the indefatigable developer is beginning to slow down. This year, he says he will drop his role of chief executive of Silverstein Properties, although he will stay on as chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More and more I walk into rooms filled with real-estate people, and I recognize less and less of them as the years go by," says Mr. Silverstein, who turns 82 years old in May. He adds, "I'm not going to be as active in the daily functioning of the company as I once was."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein also is known throughout the world as the developer who led the group that purchased the 99-year lease on the World Trade Center just weeks before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He has been instrumental in its rebuilding efforts. <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> is currently building two towers on the site and plans to build a third when it has a tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many of New York's real-estate dynasties, the children usually take over the business when parents slow down. But that's not the case with <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>, which has developed, owned or managed 35 million square feet of office, residential and retail space in the last half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of Larry's three children work at <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span>. His son Roger is responsible for leasing and managing the firm's commercial properties, while his daughter Lisa focuses on residential development. Lisa's second husband, Tal Kerret, joined <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> two years ago to start new ventures like Silver Suites, the 30,000-square-foot office space operation at 7 World Trade Center that targets growing companies. Larry's daughter Sharon, the eldest of the three children, lives in California and doesn't work in the family business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Silversteins say the question of succession was discussed for years. Neither Roger nor Lisa wanted the top job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think Lisa and I did some soul searching and decided we should look outside the family," says Roger, 49. He said he preferred to stay focused on the company's leasing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa, 46, had other reasons: She has three children and wanted her family to take priority. "I feel that a CEO is really in the role of giving 100% of themselves," she says. "There was no way that I would feel comfortable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision was to bring in someone from outside and after an extensive search the family decided on Marty Burger, who had worked 15 years at developer Related Cos. He joined the company in 2010 as an executive vice president and is already handling many of the tasks of a chief executive, family members say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger's position originally was designed as a two-year tryout, after which each party would decide if they were comfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to have a certain personality to be able to deal with everybody," Mr. Burger says. "I'm not an ego guy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burger, 47, is now co-chief executive and clearly in for the long haul, overseeing an expansion of the company into overseas projects. <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> currently has $10 billion worth of development activity in the pipeline, with recent projects ranging from a Four Seasons Hotel on Church Street downtown to the master planning of a central business district outside Shenzhen, China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Marty is a terrific young guy, and his function is really going to be to grow the company," Larry says. "We're now moving in a whole series of new directions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family's roots weren't always in real estate. Larry's father, Harry, immigrated from Russia in the early 1900s when Harry was a teenager. He earned a living as a piano teacher but realized he couldn't support his family that way. Harry became an office space broker in the garment district of Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was Larry who decided that the real way to build a business would be to own property. His first purchase was a loft building on East 23rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family members say it won't be easy for Larry to take a backseat. He's been known over the years for his high-energy level and his determination to push ahead on deals, particularly on the buying and rebuilding of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group led by <span class="companylink">Silverstein Properties</span> outmaneuvered a number of larger national real-estate companies to win the 99-year lease on the complex. Just days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks he vowed to rebuild the complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when he is spending time on his yacht, the Silver Shalis, he takes business calls. "You can take Larry out of the office, but you can't take the office out of Larry," Roger says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Larry says, "My attitude is never stop."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Roland Li </div><div>777 words</div><div>15 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOBOKEN, N.J. -- Bijou Properties began renting apartments at its latest Hoboken project, Edge Lofts, just three weeks ago and already half of the units have been taken, with rents starting at $2,645 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But future projects may be more challenging. Costs are going to rise thanks to superstorm Sandy, which will mean lower profits for developers if they can't pass them on to customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> released new preliminary flood maps that placed around 79% of Hoboken in a flood zone. The maps won't be finalized until next year, but new regulations could require developers and homeowners to raise ground-floor space up to 8 feet above the sidewalk and may lead to higher insurance costs. Under the new rules, mechanical systems could also be required to be located above ground floors in high-risk flood zones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Minervini of Hoboken-based architecture firm Minervini-Vandermark LLC estimates that new regulations could add thousands of dollars to a small project and tens of thousands of dollars on larger projects. He is currently designing two new projects with ground-floor commercial spaces that had to be raised 8 feet above the street, "which significantly reduces the value of that space," he said. "It's certainly a design challenge."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bijou Properties, which began construction on Edge Lofts two years ago, is already preparing its next two projects: 900 Monroe, a 135-unit rental property to open in 2014; and Park Place, a 212-unit rental building with retail and a charter school, scheduled for 2015 completion. David Gaber, a Bijou partner, says he thinks the new regulations will have a "minimal" impact on constructions costs, but he adds that it's still not clear how much more Bijou will have to pay for additional operational expenses from such things as higher insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk of another flood also complicates NJ Transit and Pennsylvania-based developer LCOR Inc.'s proposal to develop a 64-acre site adjacent to Hoboken's PATH station on the southern edge of Hoboken. The two partners announced in February that they would add $15 million in new flood-prevention features. Their plan, which calls for 3 million square feet in new office, residential and retail space, has drawn opposition from residents, who say it is too large. It ultimately must win mayoral and city council approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental-vacancy rate has tightened in Hudson County, which includes Hoboken, falling to 4.4% at the end of 2012, compared with 5.4% in the prior year, according to real-estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. In Hoboken, monthly rents of $2,000 for an older one-bedroom unit is typical, and waterfront units can cost upward of $3,500 per month, says Joe Stingone, a Hoboken residential broker with Century 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the sales side, the average price a square foot for a one-bedroom condo rose to $603 a square foot in March, up from $465 a square foot in the prior year, according to Prudential Castle Point Realty. Two-bedroom condos sold for an average of $484 a square foot, down from $498 a square foot in the previous year, but three-bedroom condos gained to $635 a square foot in March, up from $407 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are only around 200 condo units currently on the market, down from a supply of around 500 units before the recession, says Mr. Stingone. Damage from Sandy has constrained supply further, leading to bidding wars for the remaining properties, particularly for larger units suited for families. Mr. Stingone is representing an eight-unit condo project at 89 Jefferson St., which is about to go to market with prices starting at $750,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The financing market is extremely aggressive right now," says Mr. Gaber of Bijou Properties. "Banks are happy to lend to projects in Hoboken."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, new design costs and additional insurance costs could jeopardize financing in the future. "I think it's definitely a concern. It's on the radar," says Mr. Stingone. "I think the bigger problem is not the fact that people can't afford it, but the fact that the banks won't lend on buildings without proper coverage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additional costs for private homeowners and developers could be avoided under Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer's February proposal for a $100 million system of flood walls, pumps and gates to protect the city. She is seeking funding from the state of New Jersey and the federal government.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> put an exclamation point on the housing rally with last week's announcement of its largest-ever annual profit. The news comes soon after Fannie's cousin, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, announced its own record high. These results may seem like cause for celebration after years of losses at the two taxpayer-backed mortgage giants. But they also underscore the urgent need for reform to ensure that the next real estate boom doesn't end as badly as the last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's certainly good news that the very long housing recession is finally over, and that prices in most of the country are rising again. For the 12 months through January, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of 20 U.S. cities shows an annual increase in home prices averaging 8.1%. Prices in Miami were up almost 11% on the year, the Las Vegas market enjoyed a pop of more than 15%, and in Phoenix prices jumped more than 23%. Not a single one of the 20 metropolitan areas in the index suffered an annual price decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The healthy part of this revival is the normal adjustment of supply and demand after a painful recession. Foreclosures have been slowly working their way through the system, and the long dry spell in building means there are fewer new homes to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's a less desirable side to this new boom: It is fueled by the same kind of government super-subsidy for housing that drove the boom and bust a decade ago. Through Fannie, Freddie and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> (FHA), the feds now underwrite some 90% of all mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Fed's rock-bottom interest rates and its QE policies are both intended to reflate the housing market. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> is buying $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, despite the housing rebound, plus an additional $45 billion in long-term Treasurys to keep mortgage rates low. This makes it cheaper for families to borrow to buy a home. But the Fed's goal is also to keep rates so low that investors will dive back into real estate in a search for yield they can't get from savings accounts or financial investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sure enough, from Georgia to California, investors have been scooping up residential properties, often in foreclosure auctions. As the Journal has reported, large private-equity firms such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and Colony Capital have spent billions of dollars over the last year buying single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mom and Pop are also back buying property for investment returns, rather than for shelter. A software engineer looking to buy a house in California's Orange County as an investment property recently told the Journal, "Right now, it just seems like real estate is a good place to put cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that many of today's investors are planning to be landlords collecting regular rent, not speculators betting on their ability to execute a quick flip. But the hard part is knowing how much an asset-price rally is rooted in genuinely rising prosperity and how much in government policies that can't last. One danger sign now is that prices are rising much faster than the economy, which isn't sustainable over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also worth keeping in mind that housing is not the secret sauce of economic prosperity. The anemic 0.4% GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 would have been even worse without a 17.6% surge in real residential fixed investment. But even though the government calls it investment in GDP calculations, housing is substantially a form of consumption. A large home (assuming the occupant can afford it) is a manifestation of wealth, not a creator of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every dollar of capital that policy makers drive into housing is a dollar that won't be spent creating the next great innovation in software or medicine or something else. Over the long haul, the economy grows when people invest in things other than housing -- specifically in technologies that enhance productivity and allow all of us to achieve higher living standards. Housing does fine when people are employed and wages are rising. In other words, sustainable growth in real-estate values is a symptom of a vibrant economy, not a cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 2000s, America tried to use a debt-fueled real-estate boom as a substitute for real wealth creation. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span>'s loose money, government endorsement of private credit-ratings agencies and reckless promotion of homeownership created a housing bubble. The bursting of this bubble created a financial crisis. We do not want to repeat the experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are signs that the politicians have failed to learn that lesson. Beyond the Fed, the Washington Post reported last week that "the Obama administration is engaged in a broad push to make more home loans available to people with weaker credit." The government is pressing banks to press borrowers to take advantage of FHA guarantees and other federal subsidies. That's the same thinking that gave us the Fannie Mae-Countrywide Financial subprime loan machine, the subprime bust and the $187.5 billion failure of Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices rising again, now is precisely the time to begin reducing the federal subsidies that encourage over-investment in housing. In some areas of the country Fan and Fred still back mortgages of more than $600,000, while the FHA backs loans of more than $700,000. Reform-minded lawmakers may not be able to stop Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke from dropping money from helicopters, but they can begin reducing the conforming loan limits at Fan, Fred and FHA to put some guardrails around Washington's reckless credit policies.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ted Mann </div><div>760 words</div><div>11 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael Bloomberg has abruptly rejoined a debate that the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</span> thought it had put to rest last year: whether to extend the No. 7 subway line under the Hudson River to New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city Economic Development Corp. released a feasibility study that examined how extending the subway to Secaucus would stimulate ridership and "leverage existing investments," like the city-financed extension of the No. 7 line west to 11th Avenue and West 34th Street, a key legacy project of the mayor's three terms in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city hired the consultant <span class="companylink">Parsons Brinckerhoff</span> in early 2011 to study the merits of extending the subway, shortly after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie canceled the planned "Access to the Region's Core" cross-river tunnel project, which was a blow to those who believe the region is hampered by the limited capacity for trains crossing the Hudson between Manhattan and the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a century since there was a new rail tunnel under the Hudson, and demand for travel between New Jersey and Manhattan is growing rapidly and quickly exceeding the capacity of existing transit infrastructure," Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday through a spokeswoman. "The lack of new transit investment is creating a serious and urgent threat to New York City's economic competitiveness."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg went on to say that extending the train was "a promising potential solution" and that the city looks forward to "continuing to discuss the option."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try telling that to the MTA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An agency spokesman's response to the study's release was a single emailed sentence: "We don't see this as an economically viable idea."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is, if anything, less dismissive than the last time the MTA threw cold water on the notion of sending the subway system across city -- and state -- borders for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last April, then-MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota (who is currently running to succeed Mr. Bloomberg as mayor) declared there was "not a chance" the extension plan would happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told the mayor this, I told the deputy mayor this: I can't see this happening in our lifetime," Mr. Lhota said then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Lhota is gone now. Wednesday marked the 100th day since he departed as chairman to run for the Republican nomination for mayor. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has yet to announce a permanent replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the proposal examined by <span class="companylink">Parsons Brinckerhoff</span>, the No. 7 train would cross the river through two new tunnels and connect with the existing commuter rail station in Secaucus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extension would improve access from the suburbs through Midtown, the yet-to-be-built Hudson Yards development on the West Side and along the existing No. 7 train corridor into Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The route the <span class="companylink">Parsons Brinckerhoff</span> study examined would largely follow the path that was to have been followed by the ARC tunnels, from Secaucus, through the Palisades, deep beneath the Hudson River and into Midtown, where it would connect with the future endpoint of the existing No. 7 subway, just below 34th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project would require that one part of the current westward extension of the No. 7 line be revived: A planned station at 10th Avenue that was eliminated from the extension because of its projected cost would be restored. The move would also require improvements at busy stations already served by the No. 7 line, including Grand Central, Times Square and Fifth Avenue/Bryant Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A No. 7 train extension could support 128,000 riders per day, with up to 30 trains per hour during the morning and evening rush, the study says. It would take about 16 minutes for trains to run from the Secaucus station to Grand Central.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extension would not interfere with the other major river-crossing project that has been championed since the demise of the ARC project: Amtrak's Gateway project, which would add new tunnels to connect the northeast corridor lines in New Jersey to Penn Station in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An issue not addressed in the study is one New Jersey Mr. Christie cited in killing the ARC tunnel, the move that gave rise to interest in the No. 7 train solution in the first place: cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Parsons Brinckerhoff</span> study didn't offer any estimate of the capital or operating costs of running the line to Secaucus.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cambridge, Mass., the home of MIT and Harvard, is requiring real-estate developers to set aside low-cost office space for new entrepreneurs and startups, which are being edged out of the city's booming tech hub by high rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city this week approved a $1 billion development plan by the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span> under which the university agreed to offer 10% of the space to small tenants at affordable rents. City officials say similar requirements will likely be imposed on other developers who build in Kendall Square, an area popular with technology and biotech companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted to make sure we continue to build space for the startup and entrepreneurial community," said Leland Cheung, a member of Cambridge's city council who helped lead the initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies including <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Novartis AG</span> have flocked to Kendall Square, attracted partly by its proximity to MIT and <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>. Their presence has helped revitalize the area, but it has also resulted in a dearth of office space, pushing up rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top-quality space in Kendall Square rents for about $72 a square foot, up from roughly $40 a decade ago, the city said. "The demand is clearly greater than the supply," Mr. Cheung said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cambridge's vacancy rate for office buildings is 9.7%, well below the national average of 17.1%, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a commercial-real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities -- including San Francisco, New York and Seattle -- also are seeing high demand from technology companies drive up rents in hot neighborhoods. While some of these cities also have taken steps to encourage startups, they haven't gone as far as requiring developers to set aside cheaper space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The head of a local real-estate group said Cambridge's move is acceptable because it is confined to a specific area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If this were just a requirement put on [property] owners across the city. . .it would definitely be a serious problem because you really are creating an additional cost with. . .maybe not a predictable and secure cash flow," said David Begelfer, chief executive of NAIOP Massachusetts, which represents commercial-real-estate developers. He said Kendall Square is an area where "historically, a great number of startup companies . . . have matured and grown into successful companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cambridge eased certain zoning requirements for MIT in exchange for making affordable space available. The university will set aside space ranging from 200 square feet to 5,000 square feet, with leases as short as 30 days, said Steve Marsh, managing director of MIT's real estate. The school hasn't completed a plan for how much it will charge and how it will structure the leases, he said. MIT is one of the largest landlords in the greater Kendall Square area, owning about 90 acres of land. The new 1.2 million-square-foot project will include offices, retail space and apartments.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>857 words</div><div>11 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, when Dorothy Gusick put her three-bedroom shingled home on the market in Edgemont, a 30 minute train ride north of New York City, she had four offers within four days at or above her $749,000 asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was one more indicator that the shrinking inventory of homes for sale across much of the New York region, from commuter suburbs in New Jersey to co-ops and condos in Brooklyn, has begun to create a tight sellers' market so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A series of reports covering the first quarter show a similar pattern in many markets with double-digit declines in inventory of available units. In most markets, median prices were up from the same quarter a year ago, with large increases reported in Brooklyn, compared with a weak first quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But across the region, the number of contracts signed during the first quarter was up sharply, leading many analysts to foresee rising prices later in the year, a possibility that could make would-be buyers more eager to make deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, an appraiser and housing consultant in New Jersey, said that "the big change is a sense of urgency in the market" had last surfaced in 2006, before the collapse of housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home buyers are convinced that waiting will cost them more as prices go up and interest rates go up," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report to be released Thursday by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> said that the number of houses, co-ops and condos on the market in Westchester County fell to 5,587 listings, a 17.5% drop compared with the first quarter of 2012. At the same time the number of contracts rose 27% from the year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gabe Pasquale, the manager of Elliman's Westchester offices, said there is now a "feverish sellers' market" that started with a "trickle-up" effect from Manhattan, where the rental market and the apartment were tightening over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When Manhattan gets a cold, everyone else has the flu," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gusick and her husband, Richard, a retired stockbroker, had lived in the same midcentury house near a country club for about 35 years, but when it came to selling they made a deal quickly, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that in the week that her house was listed more than 30 brokers came through and there were multiple offers, including two "significantly over the asking price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They kept telling me the market will decide if the price was right and it did," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, Frank Percesepe, a <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> manger who oversees sales at four offices and two annexes there, said that all this activity leaves buyers in a difficult spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is very little inventory, and buyers have been trained to make offers immediately to have a chance on a deal, according to Mr. Percesepe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that earlier this year, a broker held three open houses on the same day for three new listings in Bedford-Stuyvesant. They had a total of 250 visitors that day, he said, and 50 offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Donato, a management consultant, was ready to buy a Brooklyn apartment, after paying more than $75,000 in rent over 3 1/2 years in Manhattan, but found the going rough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bid $20,000 above the asking price on an apartment on Henry Street, but was beaten by another offer of even more money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a small co-op came on the market on 75 Henry St., a 32-story tower in Brooklyn Heights he was ready. The apartment, a studio converted to a one bedroom, with a 14-foot long terrace and views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline, was listed for $495,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with his broker, Greg Williamson of Elliman, he offered the full asking price, and outbid three others who offered slightly below the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a hot market in Brooklyn Heights," he said, "and there are very few high rise co-ops and this one had a view of the Brooklyn Bridge."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another market report by Elliman out Thursday found that in Brooklyn, the number of listings in the first quarter fell 45.4% to 3,325 from the year-earlier quarter with median prices up 14.4% to $515,000 over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared the Elliman reports, said that the huge reduction in inventory, contributed to an 11% decline in sales there compared with the same quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big picture is that we aren't expecting relief in terms of more supply being added to the market," he said. "You are looking toward continued price pressure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, Mr. Otteau said that contracts signing in January and February were the strongest since 2007, while inventory fell to the lowest levels since the housing crisis began in 2006.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors gave a warm reception to home builder <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>.'s initial public offering, underlining stock investors' enthusiasm for U.S. housing-market recovery stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company sold 28.6 million shares -- not including additional shares allotted to underwriters -- 20% more than previously planned. That valued the deal at $628.6 million and making it the fourth largest U.S. debut so far in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares climbed 6.1% at the open on Wednesday before settled up $1.04 at $23.04 in 4 p.m. trading on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> during a broad market rally that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average and <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's 500</span> Index reach new highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builder's shares were priced on Tuesday evening at the top end of their expected range, reflecting solid demand for the expanded IPO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reception from investors was strong across the board," with buyers ranging from hedge funds to value-stock-focused mutual funds, Taylor said Morrison Chief Executive Officer Sheryl Palmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of real estate companies are taking advantage of investors interest in rising home prices and sales volumes since the 2008-2009 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since shares of builder <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Homes LLC</span> came to market in late January, making it the first home builder to go public since 2004, their price has risen 13%. <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span>, a Newport Beach, Calif., builder of single-family homes in the West and Southwest, filed to raise $200 million in an IPO on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the deal frenzy, <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings Corp</span>., the franchiser of real-estate brokerages such as Century 21 and Coldwell Banker, announced late on Tuesday that its largest holder, <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management LLC</span>, would sell 35 million in <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of already-public builders have rallied the past year as many investors continue to see the home market as a stand out sector in the U.S. economy. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., the second-biggest U.S. builder by annual closed sales, has led the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index the past 12 months with a 150% gain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Nate Nathan, an Arizona land broker, struggled in vain to sell several hundred home sites in Vistancia, a new-home community about 15 miles from downtown Phoenix. He listed the lots for $54,000 apiece, but no buyers would offer more than $45,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that changed over the past year. As Phoenix home prices picked up, builders suddenly started coming to Mr. Nathan and making ever-higher offers. This year, he has sold 850 lots, including 250 lots for $96,000 apiece in the past 45 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The world has just woken up and said, 'We need land!'" Mr. Nathan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is happening in Phoenix is happening in real-estate markets all over the U.S. The rebounding housing market has sparked a sharp rise in land prices, creating big profits for land investors but putting pressure on builders to further increase the price of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land values across the U.S. rose on average 13% in 2012, the first annual gain since 2005, according to estimates in a March report by Zelman &amp; Associates, a housing consultancy. The increase was fueled primarily by growing demand among builders for finished lots, or ready-to-build home sites with roads, sewage lines, electrical-power hookups and other infrastructure in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question the land market has gotten heated of late," said Richard Dugas, chief executive of PulteGroup Inc., the nation's second-largest home builder by volume, on the company's most-recent earnings conference call. "In some markets it's a real challenge to get land deals to pencil."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For consumers, costlier land means more-expensive houses. Land cost constitutes 21.7% of the final sale price of a new home, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>. As land prices rise, builders tend to pass 100% of those costs on to consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buck Horne, a housing analyst with <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp; Associates</span>, predicts that new-home prices will rise 10% to 15% in 2013, chiefly because of rising demand and because of the scarcity of land. "Buyers who can't afford to pay up now are going to have to wait. Maybe they'll have to rent for awhile," Mr. Horne said. "They may miss out on the first stage of price appreciation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a significant shift from the economic downturn, when builders halted development and liquidated land for pennies on the dollar. From 2006 through 2011, residential land lost a cumulative 58% of its value, Zelman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, land prices nationally are still far from the peak levels reached in 2005 and 2006. And they also are notoriously volatile. But this time, the new-home market appears to be gaining traction. The Census Bureau reported that in February, builders were on pace to sell 411,000 homes this year, an annual increase of 12.3%, while the rate of new-home construction rose 27.7% in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished-lot prices rose about 18% in the past year in Raleigh, N.C., a market that has seen several national builders open up shop recently, research firm Metrostudy reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, finished lots in "A" locations -- in good school districts with easy commuter access to job centers -- are selling for $1,000 per foot of frontage, according to Metrostudy. At the peak of the housing boom, Houston lots sold for $800 per front foot, said Brad Hunter, Metrostudy's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is great news for private-equity firms and other land investors, including <span class="companylink">Paulson &amp; Co</span>., <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>, that crowded into the land market at its 2009 trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is exactly what we predicted would happen," said Tom Shapiro, president of GTIS Partners, a New York-based private-equity firm that 3 1/2 years ago started buying lots in suburban new-home communities at an average of about 20% of peak pricing. "The rate of recovery in some of these markets has just been incredible," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2010, GTIS has amassed a portfolio of about 30,000 home sites and has started selling out of its land positions. In the past three months, the firm says it has almost sold out 400 lots in Carillon South Lake, a development near Dallas, where it bought land in 2010. "We doubled our equity," said Rob Vahradian, a senior managing director with GTIS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, with the inventory of finished lots dwindling, investors are beginning to bid up raw land, as well. Justin Good, a land broker with the Raleigh office of <span class="companylink">Cassidy Turley</span>, points to a parcel of raw land in North Raleigh that sold in April 2012 for $235,000 per acre. Now, builders are making offers more than 35% higher than that price on an adjacent piece of raw land. "That's staggering," Mr. Good said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been nine months since pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">Roche Holding AG</span> announced it would close its sprawling 119-acre campus in northern New Jersey, causing the loss of Roche's remaining 1,000 jobs at the site and blowing a potential $14.5 million hole in the local tax base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been enough time to reassure officials that there is interest from developers to find new uses for the 2-million-square-foot campus that straddles the township of Nutley in Essex County and the city of Clifton in Passaic County along busy Route 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the biggest thing to happen to North Jersey in 25 years," said Matthew Watkins, Clifton's city manager. "The suitors are standing there waiting and it bespeaks the interest in the site and mitigates concern that it will be a vacant lot," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the job of sorting out what will take the place of Roche's U.S. home for 80 years is still just beginning. After the drug company's June announcement of its planned departure, a committee of local and Roche officials was formed to guide the property's sale and eventual redevelopment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the committee recommended hiring New York-based architecture-and-design firm Perkins Eastman to devise a conceptual plan for the site. Roche has pledged to pay up to $300,000 for the plan, which will influence the property's marketing and eventual sale long before shovels are in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roche is aiming to put the property on the market next year -- May at earliest, according to Roche -- and sell it by the end of 2015. To make the target, Roche first must identify any water and soil contamination on the campus and that may have migrated off it, and then complete a state-overseen cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We realize the impact that the loss of Roche has on the community and as a major presence with a long-standing commitment to the community, we feel it is imperative to repurpose the site quickly so that we can attract long-term users," Tom Lyon, vice president and site head of Roche Nutley, wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial brokers say the property is likely to appeal to a developer who wants to build a mixed-use project -- chiefly with multifamily housing and retail components. "The location on the highway makes it attractive for retail and residential," said Gregg Najarian, a senior managing director with real-estate services firm <span class="companylink">Studley Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Najarian said that building office space on part of the land might make sense in the future, but the market in the area currently is saturated with vacant offices. Still, he said the site -- about 12 miles from Manhattan -- might be appealing to technology companies as well as small or midsize law firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Prezant, a director of corporate real estate with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, agreed that developers will probably be drawn to a concept that involves retail facing Route 3 and housing deeper into the site. He said he thought new office space was a possibility for the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the location might seem like a good fit for a college campus, Messrs. Prezant and Najarian both said that use would be challenging since a college's nonprofit status would keep the property off the tax rolls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among elected officials, Clifton Mayor James Anzaldi said his city is most interested in generating jobs and preserves residents' quality of life; neither, he said, would be best served by housing or retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't think housing should be on Route 3 and there are probably environmental issues, because Roche was an industrial site," he said. "And there's already a lot of retail on Route 3 and we have concerns about traffic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other officials are taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's premature to exclude anything at this point," said Nutley Mayor Alphonse Petracco. "If we decide that residential would be too great a burden to the school system, it will be crossed off, and same for retail if we find it's going to have a negative impact on traffic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swiss company is the single largest property taxpayer in both municipalities, paying $9.4 million in taxes to Nutley in 2012 and $5.1 million to Clifton. It has agreed to pay the same amounts this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campus was built as Hoffmann-La Roche's U.S. headquarters in 1929, In 2009, Roche bought biotech company <span class="companylink">Genentech</span> and decided to transfer its U.S. base to <span class="companylink">Genentech</span> offices in South San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, about 21 of the 42 buildings on the campus are still in use, housing 700 employees working in research, early development and corporate functions, according to Roche. The company developed Valium on the campus and made various drugs at the facility until 2010. Locals still sometimes refer to the facility as the "pill factory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perkins Eastman's role in the process -- Clifton and Nutley's councils are expected to formally vote to hire the firm within the next couple of weeks -- will involve conducting a market analysis on potential uses for the site, with economic projections stretching out decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five months of developing options, the firm hopes to have three separate plans, each of which is intended to be viable, according to Ming Wu, a design principal at Perkins Eastman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this stage we don't know what the options will be," he said. "We are embarking on a path of discovery and we have no basis to preclude any uses a priori."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Allen Seeve, president of Woodland Park, N.J.-based Mountain Development Corp., which has built office and data centers in Clifton, said the property could probably fetch around $500,000 an acre, depending on how the land could be used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a huge site and I would be very surprised if it sold to one developer," said Mr. Seeve, who also said he believes the property will be developed in phases over a number of years.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Edward Pinto   </div><div>649 words</div><div>10 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has ramped up its policy of quantitative easing, with the result being new stock market highs and surging bond prices. Moreover, housing prices jumped 8%, the biggest annual gain since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that more than a trillion dollars have been added to the market value of single-family homes. Homeowners are now wealthier and according to what economists call the "wealth effect," they should be willing to spend more, helping the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is another, less sanguine view of the housing recovery. Recent data released by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> (FHFA) suggest that the increase in house prices is not being driven by a broad-based improvement in the economy's fundamentals. Instead, the Fed's lower rates are simply being capitalized into higher home prices. This does not bode well for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A comparison of FHFA's conventional home-financing data for February 2012 and February 2013 shows that borrowers bought newly built and existing homes in 2013 for 9% and 15% more respectively than in the previous year. Increases of this magnitude cannot be attributed to higher incomes, as these rose a mere 2% over the last year, just keeping up with inflation. It appears that home prices are being levitated by quantitative easing. Because interest rates were .625% and .90% lower on new and existing homes respectively this year compared with last year, the monthly finance cost to purchase a new home remained the same and went up only 3% for an existing home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a housing recovery of sorts has developed, it is by no means a normal one. The government continues to go to extraordinary lengths to prop up sales by guaranteeing nearly 90% of new mortgage debt, financing half of all home purchase mortgages to buyers with zero equity at closing, driving mortgage interest rates to the lowest level in 100 years, and turning the Fed into the world's largest buyer of new mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, with real incomes essentially stagnant, this is a market recovery largely driven by low interest rates and plentiful government financing. This is eerily familiar to the previous government policy-induced boom that went bust in 2006, and from which the country is still struggling to recover. Creating over a trillion dollars in additional home value out of thin air does sound like a variant of dropping money out of helicopters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will history repeat? When it comes to interest rates, whatever goes down must go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average mortgage rate during the first nine years of the 2000s was 6.3% compared with today's rate of less than 3.5%. If mortgage rates were to increase to a moderate 6% in three years, say, some combination of three things would have to happen to keep the same level of homeownership affordability. Incomes would need to increase by a third, house prices would need to decline by a quarter, or lending standards would need to be loosened even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors and the rest of the government mortgage complex can be relied on to push for looser lending. <span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> recently came out with new rules that would grease the skids for relaxed lending standards, compliments of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the continued subpar economic recovery and our past experience with the disastrous impact of loose lending encouraged by federal policies, homeowners would best be cautious about spending their new found "wealth." Americans have seen this movie before and know how it ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pinto, a resident fellow at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>, was the chief credit officer at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> from 1987 to 1989.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>800 words</div><div>8 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has broken out of a deep slump, and prices are shooting up faster than anyone thought possible a year ago. For many homeowners, that is a cause for celebration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the speed at which prices are rising is prompting murmurs of concern that the Federal Reserve's campaign to reduce interest rates could be giving the housing market a sugar high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of existing homes rose 10% in February nationally from a year ago. They have been rising during the seasonally slow winter months -- and they show signs of jumping further as the spring buying season gets under way. What's going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, inventories of homes available to buy have fallen to 20-year lows. Home builders have added little in the way of new construction since 2008. Banks are selling fewer foreclosures. Investors have scooped up more homes, converting them to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners, meanwhile, aren't willing or able to sell at prices that are down sharply from their 2006 highs, despite a greater inclination among banks to approve short sales. Tight lending standards mean some owners will hold back from selling because they aren't sure they would qualify for a mortgage on their next home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has also revved up, first from investors buying homes below their replacement costs, and later as rising rents and falling interest rates encouraged more first-time buyers to purchase homes that have monthly payments that are less than what it costs to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving home-price expectations have also unleashed pent up demand. The U.S. added around 1.3 million households a year for the 10-year period ending in 2007, after which household formation fell to more than half that level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the population never stopped growing. Households simply doubled up. Between 2008 and 2010, the country had around two million households that "couldn't wait to launch on their own," says Mike Simonsen, chief executive of Altos Research. Many of those new households have been renters, but more are opting to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot is that, in a reversal from just two years ago, demand is outstripping the available supply. Even though sales volumes could be constrained this year by low inventories, some economists say prices are set to soar. "A lot of folks are realizing, 'Wow, there is no second wave of foreclosures. Interest rates if anything could head up. Prices are rising. If I'm going to get in I better get in now,'" says Christopher Thornberg, a housing economist with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of low mortgage rates is profound. Before the Fed began buying mortgage-backed securities in late 2008, rates for 30-year fixed mortgages stood at around 6.1%, and a borrower who could qualify for a $1,000 monthly payment could get a $165,000 mortgage. Today, that same borrower, at a 3.5% rate, can borrow as much as $222,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is this the beginning of another bubble? Not really. For now, home prices on a national basis are still below their long-run average relative to incomes. "The recovery is solid. There are pure fundamentals you can point to," says John Burns, chief executive of a real-estate consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. But he says the housing market is turning up sharply, "hockey-sticking faster than it otherwise would," because of investors, low inventories and low mortgage rates. The worry is that if prices keep rising at their current pace, "we're going to have a real affordability problem" once rates move above 6%, says Mr. Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers face a dilemma: paying more for a home today, compared with a year ago; or paying even more tomorrow at a time when interest rates might also be higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a lot slower process than we had hoped it would be, and things were getting a lot more expensive," says David Fritsche, a retired architect who lost bids on six properties in the past six months before closing last week on a home in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices may be rising on the back of the Fed's easy money, tighter credit standards are acting as a brake on the recovery. High unemployment, low savings, and high debt loads among those who would like to buy their first homes will also remain a drag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector is finally healing. But the sector may be in for more volatility until there is more demand from -- and credit for -- people who want to buy homes that they plan to live in.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Russell Gold </div><div>939 words</div><div>8 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIDLAND, Texas -- In 1927, when T.S. Hogan announced plans for a 12-story office building called the Petroleum Tower, many here were incredulous. A skyscraper? On the plains of West Texas?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But city leaders embraced the building and the status it conferred on the city as the heart of the new Permian Basin oil field, historians say. At least until 1929, when the price of a barrel of crude dropped to 15 cents and the just-opened building sat empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty-six years later, the Petroleum Tower still stands -- and history may be starting to repeat itself. Midland officials are welcoming plans to erect a 53-story skyscraper that would be more than twice the height of the tallest building in this city and rank as the sixth tallest in all of Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midland, a city 300 miles west of Dallas with a population of 111,000 people, is growing quickly as companies bring in employees to drill new oil wells in the Permian, where technological advances including fracking are freeing up huge amounts of oil. Office space and housing are hard to come by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned Energy Tower -- a mix of office space, apartments, a five-star hotel, restaurants, stores and a public plaza -- hopes to take advantage of these space shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This isn't built for show, it is built for need," said Bill Meyer, a principal in Energy Related Properties, which is working on the building with <span class="companylink">Wexford Capital LP</span>, a Connecticut-based private equity and hedge fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meyer acknowledges the oil industry's current love affair with the Permian Basin could wane, as it has several times in the past. "That's the risk you take and we're willing to take it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City leaders are hustling to back the project. Last month, Midland spent $2.2 million to buy two downtown blocks that are now home to a disused county courthouse with a 1970s facade. Energy Related Properties has a one-year option on the site. If built, Energy Tower would triple the total taxable value of downtown properties, he said. Sales taxes and property taxes account for the vast majority of the city's revenues, followed by hotel taxes. Besides gaining a big new tax base on those three fronts, proponents also hope to spur others to build and, in turn, improve the quality of life downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you want a vibrant community, you need a vibrant downtown," said Mayor W. Wesley Perry, who abstained from the vote to purchase the property because he owns an office building across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is enamored with the plans. "It just doesn't fit downtown or feel like it's responsible," said Charlotte Dixon, a third-generation Midlander who works in the billing department of a doctor's office and started an online petition last month opposing the skyscraper. She has collected 368 signatures. "Is this what we want to present to the world, that we're the Dubai of Texas?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others worry that the Energy Tower, which would cost at least $350 million and take two years to build, could open just as the oil industry's fever for the Permian Basin cools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The most dangerous words ever spoken in Midland are 'it's different this time'," says David Smith, executive director of the Abell-Hanger Foundation, a local philanthropic organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some oil executives think it is different, because the current boom has been sparked by technological advances they say will keep the oil flowing. Over the past two years, U.S. oil production has grown by 1.5 million barrels a day, or 27%. Most of that increase -- 970,000 barrels a day -- is coming from Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Chevron Corp</span>. this year unveiled plans to build a $100 million office-space campus on Midland's western edge for 800 employees. Despite rapidly rising rents, Midland's downtown has a vacancy rate under 2%, compared with 21% in Dallas, says Forshey Hoobler, a vice president at commercial real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. "There are no other cities like it," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown Midland looks frozen in time circa 1983, when the oil bust and bank collapse brought construction to a standstill. One new office building -- a 10-story, green-windowed structure that opened last year -- has risen downtown in the last three decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After work hours, downtown Midland empties out -- at 10 p.m. one recent night not a single pedestrian walked on Wall Street, the business district's main artery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Midlanders point to signs of growing cosmopolitanism, including a planned 110-unit, loft-style apartment building downtown. It "will put a new more sophisticated face on the city," said Ben Shepperd, president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association. "Frankly, most people think of us as dusty West Texas with pump jacks everywhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy Related Properties says it won't break ground on the tower unless it has firm leasing commitments. If demand is less than it expects, it could dial back to a 40-story building -- or increase the tower to 70 stories if there is appetite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Petroleum Tower became known as "Hogan's Folly," says the mayor, Mr. Perry. But it still put Midland on the map, he said, adding, "We're here because of a tall building built years and years ago."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Telis Demos </div><div>2041 words</div><div>6 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in single-family homes is becoming increasingly popular -- and now Wall Street has dreamed up a new way for investors to become landlords without worrying about 3 a.m. plumbing calls or late rent payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year or two, firms that invest in real estate have been snapping up foreclosed homes for a fraction of what they fetched before 2008. Now the firms own tens of thousands of single-family homes, and some have begun to sell them in tiny slices to hedge funds, pension funds and individual investors in the form of real-estate investment trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these investment vehicles began as privately held REITs but are now going public, opening their doors to investors of all stripes and joining the REITs that own apartment complexes and commercial properties that have been around for decades. Right now, two single-family REITs have gone public, and at least two more have announced they plan to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There will likely be a number of IPOs looking at this generational opportunity to shift home rental from individual landlords to institutional players," says Stephanie Ruiz, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group</span>, which was an underwriter on the initial public offering of <span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust</span>, one of the first single-family REITs to list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea sounds promising, given the boom in rentals since the financial crisis. But the business model still is in the early innings, and it isn't clear how efficient it is. Much will depend, analysts say, on the expertise of individual managers in such nuts-and-bolts items as leases and building maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are nibbling, in part because they are hungry for returns at a time when interest rates are hovering near zero and in part because there are strong signs of a housing-market recovery. REITs, which don't pay income taxes if they pay out at least 90% of their earnings to investors in the form of dividends, offer relatively high yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's clear today is there's a real hunger for yield, and single-family homes offer yield and appreciation potential," says Gary Beasley, chief executive of Waypoint Homes, an Oakland, Calif., firm founded in 2008 that now owns and manages more than 3,500 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told CNBC last year that if it were possible, he would buy "a couple hundred thousand" single-family homes and hold them for a long period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property-owning REITs on average carried dividend yields of 3.3% as of the end of March, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>, an industry group. Some experts say that single-family-home REITs could eventually yield more than 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there is no guarantee the new REITs will be able to deliver consistently high returns or income. While residential rental rates have broadly been rising since the financial crisis, in some market segments the gains are slowing or reversing. For example, the median rent on three-bedroom homes in the Atlanta and Dallas markets declined by more than 1% in March versus a year ago, according to RentRange, a housing data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically, it's been an individual managing a couple properties locally, and now we have institutions trying to do it at scale," says Rick Sharga, executive vice president of Carrington Mortgage Holdings, a home investment and management firm in Aliso Viejo, Calif. "But there's not a lot of history to go on, so it's difficult to make a bet not knowing exactly what the behavior is going to be in this new asset class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key for investors looking at these REITs is finding the ones that get the details right, says <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s Ms. Ruiz. "It will be about knowing when to make two-year leases, how to buy homes in good school districts, and how much money to sink into kitchens," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does it makes as much sense to own a sliver of 10,000 homes as it does to own just one?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning and renting out a home can, in theory, exceed the returns on many different types of yield-focused investments. The average metropolitan-area residential property nationally should generate a risk-adjusted annual yield -- known as the capitalization rate, or "cap rate" -- of 5.4%, according to housing research firm Local Market Monitor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential headaches of being a landlord include prolonged vacancies, unexpected maintenance and repair costs, deadbeat tenants and difficulty refinancing. And if you own only one or two properties, your exposure to a catastrophic event -- fire or flooding, for example -- grows exponentially larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, repair costs are greater for single-family-home rentals than they are for comparable apartments in a single complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Siddons is a big believer that owning a single home can be a worthwhile investment. His firm, the Glendale, Ariz.-based Key Management, handles maintenance, rental and other management tasks for about 680 properties. Most of his clients own just one investment home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he says that approach comes with plenty of headaches and hidden costs, such as the fact that you can end up owing taxes on improvements when you sell a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Siddons says experience has taught him that managing dozens of homes spread out across a single city, much less the country, doesn't lend itself to scale, such as buying paint and other supplies in bulk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you had apartment complexes, that would be best to do it that way. But for single-family houses it doesn't work," he says. There are just too many differences in the ages of homes, their individual fixtures and problems, to scale, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REITs propose to deal with those headaches by spreading them out over thousands of properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike someone who owns one home, or even hundreds, they have opportunities to reduce costs through big investments in technology, and by scouring the country to find properties that all fill the same basic profile, in terms of tenant turnover and the state of repair of the homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to look at your level of pain," Mr. Siddons says. "Can you stand being a landlord? If you can stand to buy a couple of properties and hire a management company, that's the way to go. If you don't want to be that much involved, then the REITs are the smarter way to go."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their unique structure, in practice, REITs are highly correlated to stocks, says Ron Roge of wealth-management firm R.W. Roge &amp; Co., which manages $205 million in Bohemia, N.Y. Mr. Roge says that he would expect the new publicly traded single-family-home REITs to act much the same way, adding that many investors might find they already have a significant REIT allocation through stock-index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the top holdings of the iShares Russell 2000 index ETF of small-cap stocks include <span class="companylink">Starwood Property Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Highwoods Properties</span>, which owns commercial properties mostly in the South. Starwood, which typically invests in loans to large commercial properties, has recently invested about $200 million in single-family homes, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Ferri, founder of investment advisory firm Portfolio Solutions in Troy, Mich., which has about $1.3 billion under management, says investors might consider including single-family REITs as part of their overall REIT allocation. Since the REITs own thousands of homes, they offer instant diversification, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These things are like index funds of single-family homes," he says. "There's a very small risk on a per-home basis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ferri says that the new REITs might work especially well for retirement accounts that can avoid taxes on the REITs' distributions. Investors should check that the REIT managers have experience handling single-family real estate, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, though, there are only a few options for retail investors looking to buy into the new single-family REITs. Two came to the public market in December: <span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust</span> and Altisource Residential, which was spun off by a former subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Ocwen Financial</span>, a mortgage servicer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Residential Properties, a nontraded REIT based in Scottsdale, Ariz., filed for an IPO in March and could go public later this month. Another private REIT, Malibu, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, also has announced it plans to go public this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nontraded REITs are available only to institutions and so-called accredited investors, or those worth at least $1 million, excluding the value of their primary home, or who have had an annual income of at least $200,000 for the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the single-family REITs raise more capital and accumulate more properties, bankers and analysts expect they will produce typical dividend yields in excess of REITs that invest in multifamily properties, which carried an average yield of 3.3% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omotayo Okusanya, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Jefferies Group</span>, says fully invested single-family-home REITs could produce annual dividend yields of around 5% over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two big questions for investors: Will the REITs produce the income they expect, and will they be a good vehicle for profiting from rising home prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some veteran real-estate investors are unsure about the income potential of the REITs, because the economics of owning and renting out thousands of homes aren't yet proved on such a large scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Select Income Fund, says he passed on Silver Bay's IPO, though he has invested in some private REITs. "With the existing REITs, you have more of a known pool and you have more well-established economies of scale [and] financing," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other investors will focus on whether REITs are able to buy homes at attractive prices. The REITs say they have ways of finding such properties, despite rising competition from one another, through auctions and sales of portfolios of foreclosed homes that banks are stuck with, for example. They also say they can more readily identify the good investments from the bad ones based on their vast data sets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The REITs and other funds buying homes are "still pretty small compared to the housing market overall, which is millions of home sales annually," says David Miller, Silver Bay's chief executive. "The ability for institutions to move the market dramatically is not a big concern."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some big investors in REITs might focus on finding the ones that purchase homes at the cheapest prices and are thus in the best position to gain from home price appreciation, says Jefferies's Mr. Okusanya. These REITs may trade at a premium, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't a simple matter for small investors to gauge "cheapness." That often requires using pricing databases to determine typical sale prices of nearby homes and having a sense of the "replacement cost" of constructing a new home in the same spot, a common valuation measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who currently own investment properties, or are thinking of buying them, also might welcome the entry of single-family REITs, as they could bring additional liquidity to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Sica, a Morristown, N.J.-based wealth-management adviser to high-net-worth individuals and family offices, argues that direct investing -- either by yourself or as part of a small group -- offers a greater ability to control the cost of acquisition and the timing of any sales. He says it also is possible to ride the wave of REIT growth by selling an investment property to a big fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I represent local clients who have been buying single-family homes since the crash at what I would consider great prices," Mr. Sica says. "I bet they can't wait for the suits to fly in and make an offer they can't refuse."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan </div><div>709 words</div><div>5 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in single-family rental housing face the brightest prospects for steep returns in a string of cities in the Midwest and South, many of which were hit hard in the economic downturn, according to a study released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure-tracking firm RealtyTrac ranked the 20 best markets in the country for landlords to buy single-family rental houses by calculating the annual return an investor could achieve from buying and renting out a typical three-bedroom house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memphis, Tenn., Saginaw, Mich., Toledo, Ohio, and Jacksonville, Fla., were among those on the list. In Jacksonville, the median sales price for a three-bedroom home is $90,000, and the average rent is $1,198 a month, according to figures compiled by RealtyTrac. After setting aside money for taxes, fees and maintenance, the cash flow from renting such a property is $719 a month, or $8,628 a year. That works out to an annual yield of 9.59% of the purchase price of the home, the eighth-best in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single-family rental-home industry has long been a mom-and-pop business, but in the past two years, Wall Street investment firms have poured billions into distressed markets such as Phoenix, California's Inland Empire and Atlanta, hoping to buy foreclosed homes or homes in short sales at bargain prices and then rent them at a tidy profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy has worked so far -- big landlords like <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> have said they expect initial yields of 5% to 8% on their single-family home portfolios, which number in the thousands of homes -- but some observers say it may be hard to sustain those profits for long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yesterday's investors make it harder for tomorrow's investors to get the yields they want," said Jed Kolko, chief economist for real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "All the investor activity has boosted prices and added to the rental supply, which has flattened rents."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report released Thursday, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that as investors buy and rent out homes, rents are compressing in some markets. While asking prices of single-family homes rose 7.2% nationally in the last year, asking rents rose just 0.1%, and in some metro areas, such as Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Chicago, single-family rents are falling, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Reedy, president of Reedy &amp; Co., a real-estate investment firm in Memphis, has been buying homes and renting them out since the late 1970s, and currently manages about 1,900 rental homes, 250 of which he owns personally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said while competition has risen at foreclosure auctions in the city, investors can still achieve yields as high as 10% and above. In August, he said, his firm got backing from a Connecticut-based hedge fund, and has since bought about 700 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors hit the bigger cities first, the places that were the most overbuilt. Memphis was not overbuilt, and I guess it's considered a second-tier city, but we've got a good, solid rental base," Mr. Reedy said. "Rents have been firm and steady for the last four or five years now, and lately they've been going up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a few of the markets favored by large, institutional rental investors made RealtyTrac's top-20 list, including Las Vegas (No. 5), Atlanta (No. 7), Tampa (No. 11), Phoenix (No. 14) and Detroit (No. 15). Most notably absent are any markets in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beaten-down housing markets in both Southern and Northern California have caught the eye of investors over the past two years, and rising investor interest has driven up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California markets don't make the list, said RealtyTrac Vice President Daren Blomquist, because prices there have risen so significantly that it is hard to make renting profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In California, it's really just a lot harder to cash-flow homes successfully," Mr. Blomquist said. "Investors are doing it, and they're making it happen, but it's just harder to make it happen with the higher price points."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A "Spread Sheet" article on vacation-home listings in the Mansion section on Friday incorrectly referred to Teton, Wyo., as a city. The article and graphic should have referred to Teton County, Wyo., which includes Jackson, Wyo., and the Jackson Hole ski area.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two kinds of vacation-home buyers: those who head for the mountains and those who head for the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spread Sheet asked real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> to determine the areas where vacation-home listings get the most online searches from out of state. The Delaware beaches, which include Lewes and Rehoboth beaches and overlook both the bay and ocean, top the list. In this area, 90% of home-listing searches come from outside of Delaware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delaware Beach home shoppers are typically residents of nearby metro areas looking for either a second home in a vacation destination or a primary residence in a more-affordable area, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says. Based on the company's analysis of visitors' computer IP addresses, 18.6% of home shoppers came from the Washington area, followed by Philadelphia (17%) and Baltimore (10.8%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delaware Beach is also one of the least expensive markets among vacation destinations, with a median asking price of $350,000. "The cost is more affordable here. That's what separates us," says Bruce Plummer, a real-estate agent at Coldwell Banker Resort Realty in Rehoboth Beach, Del. He adds that retirees are the most common buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other popular beachy destinations for home buyers include Kauai, Hawaii, where 84% of online searches originate outside of the state, and Captiva/Sanibel Island, Fla., with 79%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For mountain lovers, both Teton, Wyo., and Aspen, Colo., are top vacation destinations for home buyers. Here, however, they can expect to pay a lot more. The median home price in Teton, a ski area located about an hour's drive from upscale Jackson Hole, Wyo., is $1.16 million. In equally elite Aspen, the median price is just under $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's more cachet to the Aspen name than a place like Telluride," says Ben Roos, a real-estate agent at Aspen Snowmass Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, beach areas see the most online traffic during the summer, and skiing areas see the most in the winter, says Jed Kolko, chief economist and head of analytics at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. But Teton gets a lot of online searches in both summer and winter since it's a gateway to Yellowstone National Park, where there are plenty of warm-weather activities, such as rock climbing, mountain biking and white-water rafting, says Lisa Delaney, vice president of marketing for Jackson Hole <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, Teton home buyers who come from out of state seem to be looking for privacy. "You can come here and not be seen," Ms. Delaney says. "We're a bit secluded, and we like it that way."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> reported an annual profit of $17.2 billion on Tuesday, its first annual profit since 2006 and its largest annual profit ever, boosted by the housing market's turnaround and sustained declines in the number of soured home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2012 profit compares with a year-earlier loss of $16.9 billion. Fannie and its smaller sibling, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, posted banner earnings for 2012 because rising home prices have allowed them to set aside much less to cover the cost of defaulting home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a terrific 2012," Fannie Mae Chief Executive Timothy Mayopoulos said in a briefing Tuesday. "<span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> has clearly come a very long way and we're pleased and proud of that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The full-year performance was boosted by a record fourth quarter. During the last period, the company posted profit of $7.6 billion, compared with a net loss of $2.4 billion in the year-earlier quarter and up from a $1.8 billion profit in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie said Tuesday that it could report an even larger gain as soon as next month, when it will report first-quarter earnings, if it determines that the company is profitable enough to reverse earlier write-downs of more than $58 billion in tax benefits. Such a move could result in a one-time payment of more than $58 billion to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong mortgage-refinancing activity, low and stable interest rates, and an improving economy have also contributed to the turnaround. Freddie earlier this year reported an $11 billion profit for 2012, which was also a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report illustrates just how exposed the firms are to big swings in the housing market. Fannie reported losses totaling $166.6 billion in 17 of 18 quarters from mid-2007 until the end of 2011, as the housing market collapsed and mortgage defaults exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the improvement in the housing market is cutting the other way. Fannie is losing less money on homes it sells through foreclosure as prices in many markets rise, and it is approving more short sales, where the homes are sold at a loss before going into foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie last month delayed the release of its annual filing because it hadn't yet determined how to account for certain tax benefits that the company wrote down over the past five years. Those benefits would have value if the company believed it would be profitable enough to pay taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives said Tuesday that the company ultimately concluded that it hadn't met certain thresholds needed to claim the benefit. Fannie still has nearly $248 billion in nonperforming mortgages. "We still have a fairly large 'bad book' that we've got to burn off," said Susan McFarland, the company's departing chief financial officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor: If Fannie had ended 2012 with a big boost to its net worth, the company would have seen the amount of remaining bailout funds reduced sharply due to a quirk in its arrangement with the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span>. Doing that might have rattled bondholders, which could have increased the company's debt-funding costs. Claiming the tax benefit during the first quarter wouldn't trigger any drop in its remaining bailout funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report comes as lawmakers prepare to introduce various bills to address the future of Fannie and Freddie. Some analysts have said that the prospect that the firms are now profitable could tamp down any urgency for immediate overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress and the White House have resisted any sweeping changes in part because Fannie and Freddie play such a large role in the nation's $10 trillion mortgage market. Policy makers have been hesitant to tamper with that infrastructure at a time when the housing market, while improving, has been weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mayopoulos said Tuesday that even if Fannie and Freddie are returning profits to taxpayers, the companies weren't likely to exit from their current government ownership soon. The U.S. took over the companies through a legal arrangement known as conservatorship in September 2008 as rising losses threatened to wipe out thin capital levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mayopoulos said it would be a "mistake" for policy makers to conclude that there wasn't any need to advance an overhaul now that the firms aren't losing money. "There's still an important task in front of policy makers to determine what structure they want to have . . . and then figuring out how to attract capital," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which has received $116.2 billion in federal aid, has now paid $35.6 billion in dividends, bringing its total cost to taxpayers to around $80.6 billion. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which has received $71.3 billion, has paid $29.6 billion in dividends, bringing its total cost to taxpayers to around $41.7 billion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>748 words</div><div>3 April 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investment trusts enjoyed their best quarter since the first three months of 2012, but the REIT sector underperformed the broader stock market as investors developed a greater appetite for risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which tracks 137 real-estate investment trusts, delivered a total return, including dividends, of 7.9% for the first quarter. The S&amp;P 500 index and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10.6% and 11.93%, respectively, in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results in the REIT sector varied greatly among different asset types. Thanks to their high dividends, companies that invest mainly in commercial-mortgage loans and securities led the sector with a 22.6% return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But companies that own rental-apartment buildings sputtered. The so-called multifamily REITs, which had been the darling of the sector for several years, declined 0.03% in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline reflected investor concern that the improving single-family home market might result in lower rents and higher vacancies at apartment buildings. "The thinking has shifted from no one is going to buy a house ever again, to if people decide they want to get back into houses, this is bad for apartments," said Joel Beam, fund manager for Forward Select Income Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs have done better than the broader stock market for most of the financial downturn, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 for 11 of the past 16 quarters. Since the market hit bottom in 2009, REITs have returned 233%, compared with 153% for the S&amp;P 500 index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors often gravitate to REITs during tough times because they typically pay higher dividends than other companies. Currently, the average REIT dividend yield is about 3.4%, according the Dow Jones REIT Index, compared with 2% for the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Wall Street turns bullish, as it has in recent months, REITs often underperform the broader market. "It's because [stocks] are cheaper and the anticipation that some of the other sectors will return more in the next 12 months to 24 months than REITs," that we think the industry will lag behind, said Hessam Nadji, a managing director at Marcus &amp; Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, analysts generally expect REITs to generate returns this year ranging from 12% to 15% as long as job growth continues and interest rates remain relatively low. Over the past year, most REITs have reported stronger-than-expected earnings because they have been able to raise rents and boost occupancy as the economy has improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the market hit bottom in 2009, the value of property owned by REITs has gained 60% and is back to peak levels, according to an index compiled by Green Street Advisors. REITs also have benefited from a dearth of new construction in recent years and record-low interest rates, which has enabled them to raise cheap capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CommonWealth REIT</span>, an office and industrial landlord, ranked as the best-performing REIT in the first quarter with a 44% return. The stock price surged after two major shareholders launched a takeover battle for the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities, Inc</span>., the largest multifamily operator in the nation, was the worst-performing REIT, declining 5.78%. <span class="companylink">Post Properties, Inc</span>. was a close second, returning negative 5.2% on a total return basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are becoming wary about multifamily companies despite the fact that rents and occupancies continue rising. Statistics released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. showed average monthly rents up 0.5% from the previous quarter to $1,054.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rate of growth is tapering off. Also, investors are concerned because of the increase in supply. The country's 54 largest metro markets should see about 150,000 new units this year, followed by about 300,000 more in 2014 and 2015, said Luis Mejia, CoStar Group's director of multifamily research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong showing of commercial-mortgage REITs during the quarter reflected their high dividend yield of an average of 7%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>. Mortgage REITs, which use short-term debt to buy longer-term mortgage securities, also are at the greatest risk if interest rates rise because that would increase their short-term borrowing costs and cut the value of the mortgage bonds that they hold, possibly resulting in losses and reduced dividends.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's latest attempt to curb rising property prices has had the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the country's State Council told local governments to introduce strict new controls on residential-property sales and a 20% capital-gains tax. The disclosure surprised the market: Shares of some listed property developers plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short term, though, disclosing the new measures has only quickened the pace of house-price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the average house price rose 3.9% year on year in March, up from 2.5% in February, according to data from property agency Soufun. Major cities saw sharper increases, with prices in Guangzhou and Beijing up 11.7% and 11.3%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the increase is that some buyers have rushed to complete transactions before new rules are in place. It also is notable that the first wave of regulations rolled out by city governments in the past few days appear markedly weaker than what the State Council sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of the 10 cities that have so far unveiled new measures to cool the market make no mention of the capital-gains tax, while others include major exemptions, according to analysis from <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s Jinsong Du. Beijing and Shanghai have introduced measures to curb multiple-home ownership. But other cities have gone only as far as setting a target for house prices to increase more slowly than income, without introducing major new controls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even though wages in 2013 are poised for another year of double-digit percentage growth, the current pace of house-price acceleration means that target could be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, efforts to curb rising house prices appear tepid. But the risk of a further policy crackdown in the second half of this year can't be ruled out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a new residential building at 44th Street and 11th Avenue, developers plan to open a market selling everything from artisanal pickles to ramen, a permanently located take on the makeshift outdoor markets that have sprung up around Brooklyn and Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While such markets have their roots in some consumers' opposition to chain stores and industrial farming, developers say they have increasingly become the amenity of choice. They help owners bring an authentic edge to a new building while also helping them fetch top rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5,000-square-foot market is one of at least six markets opening in upscale residential and office buildings citywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Picket, president of the <span class="companylink">Gotham Organization</span>, the developer, said he initially wanted a grocery to fill the 15,000-square-foot space at the base of the new building. The complex spans an entire city block in Hell's Kitchen, with about 700 market-rate units and 500 units of middle- and low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were looking for a high-end food use for the space all along. It was too small for a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The food market, which is expected to open in late summer or early fall, features Brooklyn Kitchen, a Williamsburg-based artisanal-food and kitchen-supply shop that offers classes in home brewing, fermented pickling and vegan tamale-making. It will also be the first New York location for Ivan Orkin, a rising ramen maker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avroko, owner of restaurants like Public and Saxon + Parole, is designing the market. It also plans a stall with a roadhouse theme, which could feature variations on American classics such as buttermilk biscuits with miso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Picket said he was inspired by the outdoor markets that are summer staples in areas like Williamsburg and Fort Greene. Such markets offer an eclectic collection of stalls offering fresh produce, artisanal prepared foods and even small, sit-down restaurants. "I was looking for new ways to create community in my building, and I thought it would be great to have a marketplace in the building along the lines of Brooklyn Flea," he said. Three of the eight food operators are based in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's markets are echoes of many in New York's past, including Washington Market District, a blocks-long Lower Manhattan institution that operated from 1812 until the 1960s, when it gave way to the redevelopment of downtown. "The city really grew out of marketplaces. The market economy spawned larger economies," said David O'Neil, senior director of public markets for Project for Public Spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As New York declined, so did its marketplaces, which fell into disrepair as shoppers and the next generation of family market owners fled the city. But that began to change with Chelsea Market, a 17-building industrial complex on Ninth Avenue, where local developer Irwin Cohen in the 1990s began to rent space for about $25-a-square-foot to companies such as Amy's Bread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea Market and Eataly in the Flatiron District are credited with transforming their neighborhoods, but also with helping their owners increase prices for the office space upstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the City Point development in downtown Brooklyn, the developers plan to build a 12,000-square-foot market at the base of a new retail and residential development, which is on the former site of Dekalb Market. That was a popular seasonal market that sprang up during the three years between when the project was announced and construction started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Travis of <span class="companylink">Washington Square Partners</span>, which is developing City Point's retail portion with <span class="companylink">Acadia Realty Trust</span> said he expected it to increase demand for the apartments in the building, while also helping to create a more vibrant neighborhood. "I definitely think it will attract people to the building," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Crown Heights, Jonathan Butler, founder of the local Brownstoner blog, is developing a 155,000-square-foot creative hub, which will include a food and beer hall featuring vendors from the Brooklyn Flea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lower Manhattan, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties</span> is betting that a 25,000-square-foot market with a butcher shop, cheeses store, bakery and wine shop can help bring back locals and tourists to its 1980s waterfront office complex formerly known as the World Financial Center, where retail has languished for years in the mall at the base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Hogan, national director of retail leasing at Brookfield, said the rise of online shopping has made it necessary to add amenities that draw people to the complex, where they hopefully stick around to shop at the other stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You as a consumer do not ever have to leave your computer to go shopping; pretty much take care of all of your needs from groceries to clothing. The store has to offer an experience," Mr. Hogan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in perhaps the clearest sign the market is becoming a glitzy attraction, Las Vegas hotel king Mark Advent and his partner, Alain Ducasse, are also near a deal for a 50,000-square-foot market. Mr. Advent said the market will be "larger-than-life" with a global approach, but declined to disclose more details until the deal is done in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Is it a fad? I know it's not a fad at all. You look at the great markets from around the world. . .New York is the next generation of that," Mr. Advent said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts said new markets were risky ventures, however, because developers must invest heavily in their design and construction -- without a guarantee the location or concept will work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Where people get into trouble with markets is if they see a successful market with a lot of people and a lot of activity and they think it's replicable. Pike Place Market [in Seattle] has this grand evolution as an open market for 100, 200 years," said Mr. O'Neil, of Project for Public Spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets have acquired cache because they stand out on streets dotted with retail chains, but they could lose that appeal if they provide a baker and artisanal pickle seller in seemingly every neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. O'Neil said the city had plenty of time before that would be a concern. "New York has a long way to go in terms of market saturation," he said. "Barcelona has 46."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the area just south of San Francisco's City Hall was a grimy strip of aging midrise buildings pockmarked with payday-loan shops and panhandlers. But over the past two years, technology companies have gobbled up office space in the area, known as Mid-Market. Now, young software engineers fill the streets, cranes for new apartment towers rise on long-vacant lots, and among the many new retailers are a candy store that sells toffee for $22.95 a pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech companies have been a rare bright spot for the U.S. office market, which continues to face headwinds as banks and insurers cut back on space. But unlike typical corporate users, the tech firms are eschewing skyscraper-filled downtowns for neighborhoods long considered marginal, where office-vacancy rates have plummeted to levels far healthier than central business districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, a onetime manufacturing district called South Lake Union has been dotted with new construction since <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>. moved its headquarters there three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's fastest-growing office district is Midtown South, an area traditionally home to nonprofits and back-office work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter, Midtown South, which includes areas such as the Garment District, Union Square and SoHo, had a vacancy rate of 7.2%, compared with 11.7% in Midtown, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., with much of that growth coming from tech. This area also includes the Meatpacking District, a restaurant and retail hot spot where landlords are now seeking office rents as high as $100 a square foot. In the past, such prices were reserved for Midtown skyscrapers with views of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar transformations are playing out in Chicago's North Loop and Boston's Seaport District, where the growth of startups and established tech companies are expanding the bounds of the traditional business district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Work is now much more dispersed," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. "Some of the most sophisticated companies are not in traditional office districts."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the longevity of the shift is far from clear, as a tech boom filled with startups is volatile by nature. Some parts of these same neighborhoods flourished during the late 1990s only to reel after the dot-com bubble burst. In San Francisco's South of Market area, office rents plummeted 54% from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2002, and vacancy in that time rose to 39% from 18.8%, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties LP</span> was forced to sell a pair of towers nearby on Market Street in 2003 for less than half the $192 million it paid four years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, demand is surging, and real-estate developers are following along. For years, Douglas Shorenstein, scion of a prominent San Francisco real-estate family, focused on glitzy high-rises. In 2011, his <span class="companylink">Shorenstein Properties LLC</span> paid $110 million to buy Market Square, an 11-story art deco building that used to be a wholesale furniture mart. The hulking building, mostly vacant when purchased, is now more than 90% leased with tenants including <span class="companylink">Twitter Inc</span>.'s headquarters. The ground floor is set to include a chic new brasserie-style restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shorenstein Properties is remaking a second part of the property into a glassy office building that aims to fetch financial district-level rents. "People want to be in space that feels more comfortable -- more residential in feel than boxy, cubicle farm, institutional," said Mr. Shorenstein, the chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tech companies have been lured to these areas by lower rents, an edgier flavor and the buildings' large, open floor plans. Just as technology companies boast amenities like games and lounge areas for their employees, location is also a big factor in attracting workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate social-networking company Yammer, owned by <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>., moved to Market Square in January. The company considered the financial district but concluded employees would want to be around other tech firms in a hip neighborhood, said Mark Woolway, an executive vice president. "They don't want to work in a generic office building," Mr. Woolway said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South of Market, a onetime industrial hub, saw office vacancy fall to 5.5% at the end of 2012 from 17% in early 2009. Downtown San Francisco's vacancy, by contrast, fell to 10.4% from 12% over the same period, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mid-Market has attracted at least nine new tech companies in the past two years. In all, that means an estimated 5,700 new jobs in the district as companies fill their space, according to San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who pushed through a tax break for the area in 2011. "I thought it would be five years at the least" before the redevelopment would take off, Mr. Lee said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis </div><div>842 words</div><div>29 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy homeowners are increasingly asking their houses to earn their keep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders say a growing number of luxury homeowners are turning to a prerecession tactic of withdrawing equity from their homes. And just like during the housing bubble, many of these affluent borrowers aren't using this cash to renovate their homes. Instead, they're pumping it into investments, including the stock market, other real-estate purchases or even using the money to purchase art, which they expect will generate large returns going forward. In other cases, they're choosing to use this cash to pay for their children's college tuition or other expenses that they'd otherwise finance with higher-interest debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say the increase in cash-out refinancing comes at an opportune time: Interest rates remain near historic lows and the U.S. stock market is at record highs. Rates on 30-year fixed private jumbo mortgages -- which start after $417,000 in most parts of the country and exceed $625,500 in pricey metro areas -- average 4.02% as of the week ending March 22. That's down from 4.70% a year prior and 5.49% two years ago, according to mortgage info website HSH.com. Rates on the 15-year fixed private jumbo average 3.30%, compared with 3.95% and 3.96%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates have paved the way for some borrowers to use their home equity as leverage. Rather than keeping cash locked in their home -- banks say most cash-out refi borrowers have significant equity in their home or they own it outright -- they're choosing to put it to work elsewhere. Someone who owns a $2 million home outright could withdraw up to $1.6 million. (Most lenders require at least 20% equity to be left in the home after the cash-out refi.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, by refinancing to a significantly lower interest rate, some borrowers can end up with a lower monthly payment than they were previously paying despite ending up with a bigger loan. For instance, a homeowner who was paying a 5.46% rate (the average rate two years ago) on a $1 million, 30-year fixed mortgage would have monthly payments of roughly $5,652. If that borrower refinanced to a 4.07% rate in today's market and took out a mortgage of $1.15 million, the monthly payment would be about $5,537.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the number of private jumbo borrowers pursuing cash out refinancing is small, experts say it's on the rise. Just over 61,000 of these borrowers did a cash-out refi during the 12 months ending early February, up 7% from the same period ending a year prior, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by SMR Research, a mortgage-research firm in Hackettstown, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large lenders cite even bigger increases. So far this quarter, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> says close to 20% of all refinancings among its private jumbo borrowers involve cashing out compared with about 10% a year prior. TD Bank, which operates on the East Coast, says several thousand private jumbo borrowers signed up for a cash-out refi last year, citing a 50% increase from 2011. Citi Private Bank says more of its affluent private jumbo borrowers have been requesting cash out refinancing since last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There could be more demand to come. Depending on where interest rates head, "we could see an increase in this type of activity," says Brad Blackwell, portfolio business manager of Wells Fargo's home-mortgage unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also working in homeowners' favor are home valuations. As luxury home prices rise in many markets, some homeowners are finding they have more equity to tap in a withdrawal. Separately, some lenders say most of the requests for cash-out refis are coming from regions, such as the Northeast, where luxury homes retained or recouped most of their value since the housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, homeowners should consider the risks that accompany this strategy before proceeding. If they withdraw too much equity from their home and home prices end up falling, that could leave them in a position where they owe more on the loan than the property is worth. Here are other points to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- The home's appraisal: Some lenders will order two appraisals of luxury homes to make sure they've received an appropriate valuation before agreeing to a cash-out refinance. This also lessens homeowners' chances of borrowing too much from their home to their detriment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Loan-to-value requirements: Most lenders won't allow borrowers to pursue a cash-out refi that leaves them with less than 20% to 30% equity in their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Qualifying for a cash-out: Just as with purchasing a home, borrowers will need to provide income and asset documentation and have a high credit score to get approved for a cash-out refi.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>794 words</div><div>27 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price appreciation is accelerating in much of the U.S., offering the latest confirmation that the housing market is turning after the most severe property downturn since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose by 8.1% in January from a year earlier, the largest such gain in 6 1/2 years, according to figures from the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major metropolitan cities released Tuesday. All 20 cities posted annual increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also defied their usual winter slowdown and rose 0.1% in January from December, a period when prices often fall because sales activity is slow. After adjusting for seasonal factors, prices gained 1% from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing demand is revving up at a time when the number of homes for sale has fallen to the lowest level in decades. Low mortgage rates also are helping homeowners who can qualify for a mortgage take on more debt without a big increase in their monthly payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply shortages have developed in a growing number of markets where many homeowners are either unwilling or unable to sell because they have experienced sharp price declines. And home builders, long sidelined by competition from bank-owned foreclosures, have added little new construction. Inventory also has been whittled down as investors convert homes into rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the year began, many economists and analysts expected prices to rise at a slower pace than in 2012. But the conditions that produced last year's run-up -- low inventories, a growing economy, strong investor demand and low mortgage rates -- are "stronger than last year, and last year was strong," according to Mike Simonsen, chief executive of Altos Research, a real-estate analytics firm based in Mountain View, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> now expect prices to gain 6% to 8% this year, up from an earlier forecast of 4% to 6%. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, raised his forecast to 7% from 4% because he expects inventory shortages will persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Simonsen said those predictions could be too low and is expecting a 10% gain. The market is "crazy hot right now," he said, adding that two leading indicators of future sales activity -- sellers' asking prices and the share of homes where sellers have reduced their prices -- show continued improvement..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices began rising a year ago amid strong investor appetite for foreclosed properties and other "distressed" sales. But in recent months, data have shown prices rising for homes that aren't distressed. "That suggests a more sustainable turn, and it suggests more momentum heading into 2013," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. She's now calling for 8% price gains this year, up from a prior estimate of 4.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' expectations of future home-price gains have also picked up. Some 48% of respondents to a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> survey last month said they expected prices would rise over the next 12 months, while only 10% expected prices to decline -- the highest margin since the survey began three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another year of strong home prices could have powerful knock-on effects for housing markets digging out of a painful collapse. Another 10% gain in home prices would free around 4 million homeowners from being underwater on their mortgages, when they owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the markets with the biggest gains have been those that have had strong demand from investors. Phoenix has witnessed the largest home-price gains over the year, at 23.2%. There, around 26% of home sales in December were to investors that bought more than five homes, up from 16% a year earlier, according to a <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, where prices rose 15.3% in January, multi-property investors accounted for 22% of sales; in Atlanta, where prices gained 13.4%, 24% of homes sold to such investors in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, economists see few signs of a bubble because credit standards remain conservative. Even in markets that have seen large gains, prices are still in line with their long-run relationship with rents and incomes. A bigger concern is that price gains and rising rents are outpacing income growth, leaving some families "squeezed on housing costs," says Mr. Yun, of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. "It's an unhealthy development for prices to rise this fast compared to people's income growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see two main risks to their forecasts: a big rise in mortgage rates, or slumps in job growth or consumer confidence.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Betsy Morris  </div><div>2174 words</div><div>27 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EPPING, N.D. -- On a recent subzero day at a rail station here on the plains, a giant tank train stretches like a black belt across the horizon -- as far as the eye can see. Soon it will be filled to the brim with light, sweet crude oil and headed to a refinery on Puget Sound. Another mile-long train will pull in right behind it, and another after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, scenes like this are being played throughout the country. "Hot Trains" dedicated to high-priority customers like <span class="companylink">United Parcel Service Inc</span>. roar across the country to deliver everything from microwaves to tennis shoes and <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> packages. <span class="companylink">FedEx Corp</span>., known for its huge fleet of aircraft, is using more trains, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the revival of the Railroad Age. North America's major freight railroads are in the midst of a building boom unlike anything since the industry's Gilded Age heyday in the 19th century -- this year pouring $14 billion into rail yards, refueling stations, additional track. With enhanced speed and efficiency, rail is fast becoming a dominant player in the nation's commercial transport system and a vital cog in its economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, though, the expansion isn't so much geographic -- it is about a race to make existing rail lines more efficient and able to haul more and different types of freight. Some of the railroads are building massive new terminals that resemble inland ports. They are turning their networks into double-lane steel freeways to capture as much as they can get of U.S. freight demand that is projected to grow by half, to $27.5 billion by 2040, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Transportation</span>. In some cases, rail lines are increasing the heights of mountain tunnels and raising bridges to accommodate stacked containers. All told, 2013 stands to be the industry's third year in a row of record capital spending -- more than double the yearly outlays of $5.9 billion a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in a turnabout few could have imagined decades ago, rail is stealing share from other types of commercial transport -- most notably the trucking business, which is waylaid by high fuel prices, overloaded highways, driver shortages and regulations that are pushing up costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transport by rail is also relatively cheap. Though rising, U.S. freight rail rates are nearly half what they were three decades ago, according to the <span class="companylink">Association of American Railroads</span>. And those bargains are helping to make manufacturing in North America cost effective again. Since 2007, more than $100 billion of foreign direct investments have been made in Mexico, Robert Knight, Union Pacific Chief Financial Officer, told analysts at a recent conference. He expects annual production of 2.7 million vehicles in that country to increase by another million by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wouldn't have as many companies considering moving back to the U.S. or near-shoring," if not for rail, says Yossi Sheffi, Professor of Engineering Systems at MIT and director of its Center for Transportation and Logistics. "Some of it is the cheaper energy. But we could not be moving the oil around without rail. We could not have the huge amount of imports without the rail."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A confluence of other factors is advancing the trend. The energy boom, for instance, is reviving industries like steel and chemicals. Higher labor and transportation costs in parts of Asia are triggering a surge in sourcing from nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All those things have put the railroads into a great sweet spot for what's next in this economy," says Matthew K. Rose, chief executive officer of BNSF Railway. "Nobody wants to miss out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BNSF, purchased by Warren Buffett's <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway Inc</span>. in 2010, is investing $4.1 billion on a list that includes locomotives, freight cars, a giant terminal southwest of Kansas City and new track and equipment for its oil-related business in the Bakken shale region of North Dakota and Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Union Pacific Corp</span>. is spending $3.6 billion on a giant terminal near Santa Teresa, N.M. It is designing a new $400 million-$500 million bridge over the Mississippi at Clinton, Iowa, to replace an old drawbridge that routinely delays trains for hours at a time. It will double some track in Louisiana and Texas and expand rail yards there and in Arkansas to provide more capacity to chemical customers such as <span class="companylink">Dow Chemical Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CSX Corp</span>. will spend $2.3 billion partly to finish the first phase of a multiyear project, raising highway bridges, enlarging mountain tunnels and clearing some 40-odd obstacles to make enough space to accommodate double-decker containers all the way from the Midwest to the mid-Atlantic ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kansas City Southern Railway Co</span>. will spend $515 million. "We're a growth railroad," David Starling, its chief executive, told a securities analyst who questioned the expenditure in January. "The worst thing this team wants to be accused of is having some service deterioration because we didn't have the foresight to spend the money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passenger rail is undergoing something of a renaissance, too. It was the passenger business that nearly killed the freight business in the 1960s and 1970s. Part of the legislation designed to save the railroads in the 1970s allowed them to shed the passenger business. Lately, the Obama administration has invested nearly $12 billion in passenger rail, according to the Department of Transportation, that has been used to fund 152 projects in 32 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trains may seem like relics of a bygone era. Not so. Steeled by a near-death experience in the 1970s -- when many railroads filed for bankruptcy and braced for the threat of a government takeover -- the railroads instead were largely deregulated. The survivors fought hard. They squeezed capacity, resolved labor issues, swallowed up weaker players and rebuilt. By the time rail's prospects began to brighten a decade ago, the executives were "a much younger, more IT, more metric-minded group," says William Galligan, vice president of investor relations at <span class="companylink">Kansas City Southern</span>. "They had a whole new view toward how you run a railroad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On long distances, trains have been cheaper than trucks for decades. They can move one ton about 500 miles on one gallon of fuel, which makes them three to four times more fuel efficient. Yet they were notoriously unreliable. In logistics, trucks and planes typically arrived on time. Trains, conversely, were known as "the black hole of rail," says Prof. Sheffi. Eight years ago, he says he waited a full month for a train to deliver a new car from Ohio to Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curtis Whalen, an executive director of the American Trucking Associations, says trucks "compete in all various modes and we have some advantages." Trucks, he says, are still generally more reliable [than trains]," he says. "Our [data] shows that our truck transportation numbers are not going to be diminished by rail over any kind of time period."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past decade, though, under pressure from customers like UPS, trains have become more dependable. UPS "trained us in what it means to perform to their very high standards," says Mr. Rose at BNSF. "I'm sure there were many times they were very frustrated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't know if we're the largest customer [of the railroads] but I would tell you we're certainly the most demanding," says Ken Buenker, a vice president in UPS's <span class="companylink">Corporate Transportation Group</span>. UPS's goal is an on-time arrival rate of 99.5%, he says. "So think about how much you risk with a train." One breakdown could delay many deliveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Railroads used technology and strategy to tackle such problems. They used sensors to detect mechanical issues before they caused delays. They developed their own version of the airline "hub and spoke system" and organized shipments in trains all bound for the same destination. The latter move eliminated the time- and labor-wasting stops to break trains apart and reset them. It also paved the way for longer and speedier itineraries. Railroads "are always talking about efficiency and speed," says Mr. Buenker. "The velocity of the network is really key for them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Railroads, though, can't be entirely sure of clear track ahead. "There are certainly things that concern us," says <span class="companylink">Union Pacific Corp</span>.'s chief executive, Jack Koraleski, like juggling capital investments with return to shareholders amid constant concerns about regulation that might tie their hands. Some shippers protest increased rail rates, saying they result from lack of competition. They are urging the <span class="companylink">Surface Transportation Board</span> to act, and the board is studying the issue. Rail executives say their rates are market-based -- just like their customers' are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Sangalli, director of the Container Store Inc.'s logistics and transportation, used to rely on trucks. He had begun testing rail two years ago, concerned that trucks were breaking down and missing important store delivery schedules. Trains, he thought, might offer a few advantages. Instead, he found many. Rail, he says, cut his transportation costs by 20% on average. On problem routes, the cuts were about 40%. He says he has also reduced his 46-cent a mile fuel surcharge by half, and his company's carbon footprint by 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Importantly, Mr. Sangalli's deliveries arrive on time. "I know as soon as I hand it off to BNSF it'll arrive in three days," he says. Now, when <span class="companylink">Container Store</span> opens a new store, he says, "the first thing we look at is can we get to it on rail?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Whalen, of the trucking associations, says he is "unaware of any data or reports that show that rail beats trucks" when it comes to on-time deliveries. "At the end of the trip, you still normally use a truck," he says. "Rails just don't go everywhere."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S. oil boom, rail's new attitude has made it both a preferred mode of transport -- and also an instrument of arbitrage. When oil began flowing in North Dakota, BNSF was perfectly situated. Its <span class="companylink">Burlington Northern</span> Line from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Puget Sound cuts diagonally northwest through 16 of the 19 top oil-producing counties in North Dakota, then parallels the Canadian border through five of the six top-producing oil counties in Montana. Until several years ago, though, it was mostly a high-speed route for loads like lumber from the Northwest and grain from the Great Plains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in 2009, BNSF's Mr. Rose had dinner with <span class="companylink">EOG Resources Inc</span>.'s chief executive officer, Mark Papa, at the Four Seasons in Houston. Mr. Papa said he had a new technology that was going to produce oil, but "he didn't have a way to get it out of North Dakota," Mr. Rose recalls. There wouldn't be enough pipeline capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil nearly always travels below ground -- by pipeline. Unlike pipelines, which travel between two fixed points, trains can transport the oil in many more directions. They also let producers go where the demand is -- taking advantage of spreads of as much as $25 a barrel in markets pipelines can't reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, "crude by rail" was just an experiment. But by November, big oil players had carved out a plan here, dooming a new pipeline project in favor of a dozen rail-loading sheds. By year's end, more oil was moving out of North Dakota by rail than by pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BNSF had hauled its own fuel, "but nothing of this magnitude," Mr. Rose recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The railroad had to set up a network to handle the new business. "If we do it, we've got to do it in long unit trains to be able to compete with the pipelines, and we've also got to build big loop tracks into your facilities to get trains in and out in an efficient manner," he told early customers. "All along, we talked amongst ourselves: is this a short-term deal or a long-term deal," he recalls. He was dubious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But EOG's interest attracted other producers, who began leasing tank cars, buying land and putting up rail loading buildings. As a modern-day gold rush unfolded, BNSF added track, replaced rail, upgraded signals and hired hundreds of new employees. BNSF expects to increase daily crude oil shipments this year to 700,000 barrels from 500,000 at the end of last year, says Mr. Rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent winter day near Minot, N.D., BNSF crews worked feverishly, despite numbing minus-23 degree temperatures, to repair frozen parts that were jamming the brakes of eight tank cars. Their hands were cold despite gloves, but nobody wasted time to warm them. They wanted to get the tank cars back online. They were in a race against OPEC, China, Brazil. They were part of the new pipeline.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>714 words</div><div>27 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that <span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>. has completed its seventh real-estate acquisition since 2011, one theme in its property-investment strategy is becoming clearer: The New York private-equity firm is joining the push into smaller markets in a search for higher yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KKR</span>, whose co-founders included Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, has owned real estate over the years but began a major push to diversify into real estate in 2011. It has acquired a shopping mall outside Chicago, a Pittsburgh office building and is developing a master-planned residential community in North Dakota to meet fast-growing demand from oil workers for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its latest acquisition is the Legends Outlets Kansas City, an outdoor mall in Kansas City, Kan., that is banking on its location to attract shoppers from nearby smaller cities such as Wichita, Kan., and Lincoln, Neb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, a venture of <span class="companylink">KKR</span> paid $132 million for the property, about 40% less than it was valued when a controlling stake traded at the top of the market in 2007. The property is expected to yield a return of about 7%, well above the 5% return on many properties in large cities such as New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Secondary markets with excellent fundamentals, including 'in check' supply, create compelling investments," Ralph Rosenberg, global head of real estate for <span class="companylink">KKR</span>, said in a statement. The company declined to comment on returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shopping mall, located in a growing entertainment district that draws an estimated 10 million visitors annually, has fountains, outdoor fireplaces and walking tours highlighting legends such as basketball great Wilt Chamberlain. By buying the property at a fraction of its replacement cost, the <span class="companylink">KKR</span> venture will have capital to invest in building space for new tenants. While the property is 94% leased, that new capital will enable the property to complete a stalled conversion to an outlet destination. "You can add additional dollars and have it make sense," said Dan Lowe, one of the Legends' original developers who is now part of the <span class="companylink">KKR</span> venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say finding new tenants won't be easy. Similar to many markets nationwide, Kansas City developers delivered a number of new projects financed with generous local-government incentives and cheap bank debt. That has pushed the total retail square footage in the region to 26 million, or about 6.5% more per capita than the national average, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm. It also has made competition stiff for shoppers and retailers alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you're oversaturated nobody gets the sales they need to do well," said Suzanne Mulvee, research director with <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>. "I look at this [property] as incredibly challenging to reposition."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, its location should help. The mall sits in an entertainment district that opened about a decade ago on farmland on the outskirts of Kansas City. The district now includes the Kansas Speedway, a casino and a professional soccer stadium. The attractions, as well as retailers such as Nebraska <span class="companylink">Furniture Mart</span> that are located near but not in the mall, have enabled Kansas City to compete for tourists' dollars with its larger neighbor Kansas City, Mo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before, we had wonderful small historic museums and we were a nice place to stop on the way to somewhere else," said Bridgette Jobe, executive director of the Kansas City Kansas Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. "Now we're the destination."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the property has struggled to tap that advantage. Concern about traffic jams pushed some local shoppers away. Meanwhile, developers initially positioned the property as an upscale mall but have since shifted gears to focus on outlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">KKR</span> venture is taking control as the property appears to be on the upswing. Occupancy is back to about 94% and net operating income is above $9 million, Mr. Lowe said. He believes the transition to outlets is the right store formula. In addition, Mr. Lowe said there is little new construction planned, and he noted much of overbuilding during the boom occurred far from the Legends, which is about 12 miles west of downtown Kansas City.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- When Zhang Yuliang's property company struck a deal to buy and develop a residential and hotel building in downtown Sydney, he had Chinese customers in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The number of rich Chinese who invest abroad, who are employed abroad, is huge. And the number is becoming bigger," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zhang's Shanghai-based Greenland Group earlier this month said it bought the project from Canadian firm <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management Inc</span>. for 107.5 million Australian dollars (US$111.4 million). That adds to an international portfolio that includes a project on Jeju Island in South Korea and partnerships with hotels in Spain and Germany. Last week, it said it plans to list some of its overseas assets in Hong Kong this year, which would pave the way for offshore capital-raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zhang, chairman of Greenland, said the company also is considering investing in the U.S. West Coast. "We are interested in places where there are many Chinese people," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State-controlled Greenland has become the latest Chinese property developer to look abroad, as many seek to diversify as well as cater to rising demand from Chinese migrants and investors. Many of them have been shut out of the property market on the mainland because of government steps to cool the domestic property market for fear that surging housing prices could hurt social stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese property deals abroad rose sharply last year to $1.86 billion from $547 million in 2011 and $90 million in 2010, according to data from Dealogic. Excluding Hong Kong, deals last year totaled $450 million, a 46% jump from 2011. Dealogic didn't factor in deals smaller than $100 million unless they made up the acquisition of at least a 5% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, the world's largest home builder by revenue, in February said it was investing in a joint-venture luxury condo project with a total of 655 units in San Francisco with Tishman Speyer. "Outstanding companies need to have a global perspective," said Vanke Chairman Wang Shi when the Tishman Speyer deal was announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Xinyuan Real Estate Co</span>., a Chinese property developer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, bought a site in Williamsburg, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, for its first development in the U.S., a 216-unit condominium building. Xinyuan plans to sell about 40% of the units to Chinese investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Big developers like Greenland and <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> have wider brand recognition compared to the smaller firms and foreign firms," said Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts and participants say Chinese developers could struggle at first because Chinese buyers often prefer to purchase from a foreign developers. Home buyers often would rather buy from a developer with a history in the local market, said Bunny Wang, director of International Properties at <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span>, who has been advising Chinese customers about overseas home purchases since 2010. "Customers will also look into a developer's track record; if it had constructed a landmark building before, if it is trustworthy," said Ms. Wang. "They generally have the impression that foreign developers deliver better quality homes compared to their Chinese counterparts."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mall Landlords Get a Penney for Thoughts --- Property Owners Ponder Their Options if Struggling Retailer Decides to Shutter Some Stores; a 'Source of Cash'</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson  </div><div>888 words</div><div>27 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. shopping-mall owners, already hit with store closures by longtime laggard <span class="companylink">Sears Holding Corp</span>., are now pondering what steps to take if struggling chain <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney Co</span>. closes some of its 1,104 stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penney hasn't announced any plans to sell or close stores in the wake of posting a $985 million net loss and a 25% decline in sales for its fiscal year ended Feb. 2, a year in which Chief Executive Ron Johnson's abrupt turnaround plan failed to take root.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet investors and analysts are querying mall owners about their contingency plans in case Penney vacates certain stores -- at least 675 of which are in malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company owns 429 of its stores -- nearly 39% -- and some of those could be sold to raise cash or be put into a real-estate investment trust that controls the stores and subleases space to other retailers. Many of the remaining stores are under long-term leases at the nation's biggest mall landlords, including <span class="companylink">CBL &amp; Associates Properties Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Macerich Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Penney representative declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall owners predict that it wouldn't be difficult to replace Penney stores in the best U.S. malls, such as Aventura Mall in Aventura, Fla., and Park Meadows mall near Denver, where other large tenants might want to take over space. In other cases, mall owners could restructure the space to house several smaller stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The greater challenge, many mall owners and analysts say, would be to replace Penney stores in average and subpar malls, where Penney, like Sears, has hundreds of stores. Many of these malls are in older suburban locations or in smaller metropolitan areas. Sears, mired in years of declining sales, has closed 68 of its Sears department stores since 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon, owner of 325 shopping centers in North America and Asia, has replaced more than 60 department stores in the past decade with new retailers. Only six of the 635 department stores in Simon's portfolio currently are vacant. With few new shopping centers being built in the U.S., most expanding retailers must wait for space to become available in existing malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have an ongoing strategic process in place where we keep a running analysis of what users would be interested in each property," said Rick Sokolov, Simon's president and chief operating officer. "So, if the opportunity presents itself to get some space back, we're in position to take advantage of that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Macerich</span> has 36 Penney stores in its U.S. portfolio of 62 malls. Art Coppola, <span class="companylink">Macerich</span>'s chairman and chief executive, said he anticipates that Penney will remain a viable tenant for mall owners. But, "we have a plan for each and every [Penney] location," Mr. Coppola told investors at a conference in Hollywood, Fla., hosted by <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. on March 5. "Some of them would be terrific. Some of them would be OK. And some of them would be more challenging."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 111-year-old retailer is struggling after a shake-up led by Mr. Johnson, an <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. veteran chosen by big Penney investors to revive the company, failed to spur sales and attract new clientele. Mr. Johnson has reversed course on some of his most striking programs, such as eliminating sales promotions in favor of making low prices the chain's standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penney is pushing ahead, though, with a plan to re-create hundreds of its properties as collections of boutique stores for brands such as Joe Fresh and Jonathan Adler. The changes, however, are expensive. Penney finished its last fiscal year with $930 million of cash, down significantly from prior years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retailer's struggles have some observers thinking it soon will turn to its real estate as a savior by selling some of the 429 stores it owns or the long-term contracts on those it leases. "The challenge is that they may need more cash to complete their transformation," said Cedrik Lachance, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors Inc</span>., which tracks real-estate investment trusts, including most big mall owners. "To that end, I think that <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span> may look to its real estate as a source of cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Possibilities include Penney selling some of its stores and leasing them back, or Penney selling some to mall owners who intend to raze them and rebuild them for other tenants. The latter is most likely to occur in malls with high sales volumes, where demand from other retailers for space is strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble for Penney is that its stores are skewed more toward average malls. Since the recession, retailers and shoppers have favored strong malls over their average and struggling peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the few expanding department stores that might replace Penney, such as <span class="companylink">Nordstrom Inc</span>., tend to choose the best malls in each market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall owners, in turn, are spending most of their time and capital redeveloping proven malls to generate more sales rather than pouring money into struggling properties unlikely to produce a similar return.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxiety over depositors bearing bailout costs in the euro zone lured fresh buyers into safe-harbor Treasury bonds, helping the market shake off an earlier price decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bailout for Cyprus on Monday eased fears over the euro zone's sovereign-debt crisis, which propped up U.S. stocks Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the bond market remains resilient under the weight of both higher equity prices and new government debt supply. Traders said this signals that the key condition in keeping Cyprus's banking system afloat—large depositors taking losses—has generated angst and prompted some asset allocation out of the euro zone and into Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"European lawmakers continue to float the idea of using Cyprus-style bail-ins as a template for banks in the euro region," said Dan Brierley, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies LLC. "This makes people very nervous who have unsecured deposits in shaky banks in Europe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That money needs to find a home," Mr. Brierley said. "What better place than in the U.S.?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose by 2/32 in price in late-afternoon trading, pushing down the yield to 1.906%, according to Tradeweb. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market found additional support Tuesday from mixed U.S. economic releases, which bolstered bond bulls' argument that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> won't taper off its Treasury debt purchases any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger-than-forecast rise in overall durable goods and improvement in a home-price gauge was offset by a drop in consumer confidence and a decline in new home sales, a sign the pace of the U.S. economic growth remains moderate. The Fed's steady buying of bonds has been a main factor holding down yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note's yield has fallen after hitting an 11-month peak of 2.086% earlier this month. The yield has risen from 1.76% at the end of last year, meaning bond bears still have won out so far in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices fell earlier as fears over the latest flare-up in the euro zone's sovereign-debt crisis eased. Dealers also pushed up bond yields earlier to prepare for the $35 billion two-year note auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market faces two more auctions in the coming sessions, which kept bond price strength in check. A sale of $35 billion in five-year notes is due Wednesday, followed by $29 billion in seven-year notes Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall demand for the two-year note sale fell to the lowest since July 2011 due to slim yields in shorter-dated notes. The notes were sold at a yield of 0.255%, the lowest this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some traders said demand for the five- and seven-year notes may be stronger because some fund managers likely buy from the auction to match the monthly adjustments in their benchmark bond indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the last trading session of each month, newly minted bonds replace maturing debt in some bond indexes, spurring fund managers to buy bonds.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos </div><div>2179 words</div><div>26 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Forest, Calif. -- Jeff Pintar had buyer's remorse as he purchased 12 foreclosed homes in five Southern California counties on a single day. His regret: that he didn't buy more homes a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things have turned around faster than anyone anticipated," said Mr. Pintar, who first began buying properties here four years ago and now owns or manages 1,700 homes, which he rents out for between $1,000 and $3,800 a month. Here in Orange County, nearly every home listed for less than $400,000 "is being pursued by institutional investor capital," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing recoveries almost always have been ignited by rising demand from families and individuals looking for a place to live. This recovery is different. Investors -- including some big Wall Street players -- are leading the way, say industry executives and analysts. Their role is noteworthy given that flippers and speculators were blamed for helping to inflate the housing bubble of the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's investors are mostly buying with the intention of holding on to the homes and renting them out. As they pile into the housing market, they have set off a chain reaction that has stabilized prices and changed market psychology, industry executives and analysts say. Fear of buying homes when prices are dropping has been replaced by the fear of missing out on cheap homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether they knew it or not, investors helped set a floor. They warmed up the market, and it brought buyers back," said Lanny Baker, chief executive of real-estate brokerage ZipRealty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have always played a role in the housing market, but their presence was often small. Currently, cash buyers -- largely investors -- make up about 32% of sales nationally, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. In Southern California, a favorite target for investors, absentee buyers accounted for 31.4% of purchases last month, up from an average of less than 17% between 2000 and 2010, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> MDA, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some firms have focused only on Sunbelt markets with newer housing stock, others are branching out. <span class="companylink">American Residential Properties Inc</span>., which began amassing hundreds of homes in Phoenix four years ago, earlier this month bought 93 homes in Chicago's southern suburbs, bringing its total there to around 300. On Friday, the company said it planned to raise $300 million in an initial public offering, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rush of investors into the housing market follows a long push by federal policy makers to foster the American dream of homeownership that unraveled for some people in the housing crash. The homeownership rate fell to around 65% last year from 69% in 2005. "We're clearly at the beginning of a rental boom," says Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics. "We all saw there had to be a shift towards renting single-family units that owners could no longer afford. Investors played a critical role in that transformation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their arrival will further transform some communities already hit hard by foreclosures and falling home prices. Renters have less of a stake than do homeowners. But deep-pocketed investors can still be good news for neighborhoods that otherwise would be at risk because so many homes had been neglected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where investors are scooping up homes, "you're no longer seeing shabby homes that have grass growing up to the doorknob," said Ivy Zelman, who owns a real-estate advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house-rental market long has been dominated by mom-and-pop outfits, including retirees, real-estate brokers, doctors and other professionals, and they still account for most investor purchases. Over the past year, large private-equity firms such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and Colony Capital have spent billions of dollars buying up single-family homes. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> says it has purchased 20,000 homes since early last year. It is buying more than $100 million worth of homes a week and has spent $3.5 billion so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives in these companies say the rental market for single-family homes is fertile turf because home prices are relatively low and rental rates are healthy. They expect the number of families locked out of homeownership -- because they don't have strong enough credit or savings to qualify for a mortgage -- will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 12% of all U.S. households -- more than 14 million people -- rented a single-family home in 2011, up from 9% in 2004, according to the most recent U.S. Census figures. Three-fifths of people who lost their homes to foreclosure in the past five years ended up renting a house, said Ms. Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very attractive time to buy a home if you can," said Justin Chang, president of Colony American Homes, a subsidiary of Colony Capital. That has created "a big opportunity to rent homes to people who for whatever reason have chosen not to buy or can't buy." Colony has spent more than $1 billion on 8,000 homes in seven states, and Mr. Chang said it isn't through buying. "In each of the markets we're in, we think we can go deeper," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are concentrating on markets that have cheap housing and where job growth -- and rental demand -- is revving up. A year ago, Phoenix became the hottest target, and with prices there up by 20% since early last year, investors have raced to find similar discounts in other metro areas. <span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp</span>., which last year became the first publicly traded home rental firm, owned some 3,400 homes in 10 different markets from Phoenix to Atlanta to Tampa, Fla., at the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is also attractive to startup investors. Srini Nallapareddy purchased a home for his family in Orange County's Lake Forest four years ago and is looking to buy a second home in the same area. He plans to hold on to one as a rental and live in the other. "Right now, it just seems like real estate is a good place to put cash," said the 40-year-old software engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors have contributed to the emerging housing rebound. An improving economy and low mortgage rates have stimulated demand among traditional buyers. But these new buyers are finding shortages of homes for sale in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High maintenance costs traditionally had kept investors out of managing hundreds of scattered-site rentals. But investors set about overcoming those hurdles two years ago because low interest rates engineered by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> generated "a tremendous appetite for yield," said real-estate consultant John Burns, who advises investor firms. "It really sent capital chasing to figure out this business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have concentrated their homes in particular neighborhoods, while using technology that allows them to manage homes by collecting rent and handling property-maintenance requests online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone believes that the current level of investor activity is healthy. Some worry that investors will eventually flee the housing market if values erode again or if the expense of maintaining a large number of homes becomes onerous. "Are they going to continue to maintain them? Or are they going to dump them into the single-family market?" said Mr. Thornberg of Beacon Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors have a notorious history in the housing market. During California's housing bust in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the federal government sold hundreds of homes in California's San Bernardino and Riverside counties, about an hour east of Los Angeles. Some homes weren't maintained, turning entire neighborhoods into shabby rental communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony's Mr. Chang said sophisticated real-estate professionals are unlikely to repeat such practices. "If you're building the business for the long term, which we are, the incentive is to make sure the assets are looking good," he said. "If you let them go, tenants will leave."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investor interest in housing has helped stem big declines in household wealth, their ubiquitous presence is a growing problem for individuals who are finding themselves on the losing ends of bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't find anything because investors are gobbling up everything that is affordable," said Gloria Wain, 66, of Costa Mesa, Calif., during a morning meeting with her real-estate agent. After losing out to 18 offers -- mostly cash offers from investors, according to her agent -- she decided to raise cash herself in an effort to compete. She plans to borrow money from her son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County, investor purchases accounted for around 22% of home sales last year, up from 11% in 2007, according to Mr. Burns, the consultant. Fewer than 3,300 homes were listed for sale last month, down from 7,200 one year ago and more than 10,600 two years ago. The decreased supply has pushed prices up by nearly 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Pintar, the competition from other investors means he has to change his tactics. Last year, Mr. Pintar's company mainly purchased foreclosed properties individually at courthouse auctions, known as trustee sales, before the homes were repossessed by banks and listed for resale. He buys both for his own portfolio and for institutional investors, including Colony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, fewer than 10% of foreclosures went to investors at courthouse auctions in Orange County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year, investors bought nearly half of foreclosures at such trustee sales, according to data maintained by ForeclosureRadar.com, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has sent Mr. Pintar searching for deals through traditional real-estate listings, especially short sales, where homeowners who owe more than their property is worth get the bank to agree to sell the property at a loss. Investors can have an edge here over homeowners, who often need to move into the house by a certain date, because short sales often take a long time to complete. About a third of his purchases these days are short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a pair of second-story office suites off Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point, Calif., a team of buyers at Pintar Investment arrives at 6:30 every morning to prepare for the auction sales. They analyze 1,000 properties every week, arrayed behind pods of computer screens that look like a Wall Street trading floor. A poster hangs on one wall that reads, "Invest Like a Champion Today."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Mr. Pintar's investors have him steer clear of certain homes, such as those with swimming pools, which require extra maintenance that isn't covered by higher rent. Mr. Pintar focuses on neighborhoods that have low crime and good schools and are near freeways and shopping areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once they have got their shopping list, "it's a conveyor-belt machine that goes into motion," said Mr. Pintar. Field inspectors visit the homes, interview the owners and assess repair needs. A separate team combs tax and title records to make sure there aren't additional liens, which the new owner would have to pay off. Purchased homes get fresh paint, carpet, appliances, fixtures, and granite countertops. Skimping on repairs only leads to higher expenses later, said Mr. Pintar, who owns a separate property-management company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He founded his firm four years ago. At first, he focused on buying rentals in California's inland counties -- San Bernardino and Riverside -- where there were more foreclosures and lower prices. But as competition there has heated up, yields -- or the amount of rent a property fetches divided by its selling price -- have fallen. He is willing to accept lower yields in more expensive coastal markets that have better prospects for price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pintar dismisses the concerns raised by critics about investor-owned housing. "Let's face it: The banks weren't putting any money into them after foreclosure, and an owner that is not making his payments is not taking care of the house," he said. "These homes are now cleaned up with people living in them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pulled his Mercedes-Benz up to the curb during a recent visit to a peach-colored three-bedroom on Belgreen Place in Lake Forest that his company bought for $375,000 and plans to rent for $2,600 a month. The drapes were drawn and weeds grew around a child's plastic slide on the front lawn. "This one looks like it's going to need a lot of repairs," he said. Mr. Pintar pointed out a tidy dark-green home with white trim and a neat lawn across the street. "When we're done, we want it to look like that," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pintar said he has no plans to slow down. In the past four months, the professional landlord hired 75 new employees. He also looked into buying his own commercial office building for his growing operation, he said. "We figured why pay rent to someone if you don't have to?"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANHATTAN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocking Up on Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Shutterstock</span>, a company that licenses images to other businesses and websites, has nearly 5,000 pictures of the Empire State Building in its photo library. Now the company will get the chance to get a few close-ups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last week, the tech startup signed a lease for more than 80,000 square feet of space on two whole floors of the landmark Midtown building. The company, which had begun to feel cramped in its space at 60 Broad St. in the Financial District, has added about 50 employees since it went public in an offering on the New York Stock Exchange in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The signing is a coup for the Malkin family, one of the Empire State's largest ownership groups, who over the past few years have been overseeing a costly renovation of the building in an effort to attract higher-paying tenants. The social-networking company LinkedIn recently doubled its space in the building, which was constructed in 1931.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been growing, and what we want is a more collaborative, open environment," says Jon Oringer, <span class="companylink">Shutterstock</span>'s chief executive. He says the company plans to keep the two floors it leases open, connected by a staircase, in order to facilitate team meetings among the company's various divisions. "We were looking for really big floor plates, but if you want to go around there [in Midtown], you'd have to look at three or four floors to get the same amount of space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear what <span class="companylink">Shutterstock</span> is paying for its space, but annual asking rents in the Empire State Building range between $51 and $55 a square foot, according to people who have worked on leasing deals there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few landlords today are able to achieve asking rents in office towers without offering generous concessions to tenants. In recent years, the city has made an effort to attract more tech startups to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think technology and media that are driving the market," says Paul V. Ippolito of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, who represented <span class="companylink">Shutterstock</span> on the deal. "It used to be the hedge funds, the financial industry, but they're all downsizing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ippolito says the company has been looking for a new headquarters space for more than a year, including locations in Midtown and the Financial District. Other spaces the company considered include 199 Water St. and the former New York Times headquarters in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think New York in general kind of has a tech image issue," Mr. Oringer says. "But over time it's getting better and better. I'm psyched to move into a kind of iconic New York building."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Jade to Arrive</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer of the new Jade hotel in Greenwich Village already has plans for two more Manhattan hotel projects under the same brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Gemini Real Estate</span> Advisors has building sites in Midtown and NoHo where it plans additional Jade hotels, said William Obeid, the company's chief executive. The two new buildings will each have 120 rooms, similar in size to the original 113-room Jade, and will have similar prices compared with the first Jade, where nightly rates begin at $400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obeid seeks to capitalize on New York's record tourism and the improving economy. He plans to announce groundbreaking for both projects within the next four to six months. The hotels are expected to open in the middle of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gemini currently controls seven hotels in New York, a hotel in Boston and malls in the Southeast U.S. The company also plans to expand in Miami and is looking at opportunities in Washington, D.C.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>772 words</div><div>25 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the number of visitors to New York continues to surge, Manhattan hotels like the Milford Hotel in Times Square remain hot investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the hotel, purchased in 2010 for $200 million by real-estate investor <span class="companylink">Rockpoint Group</span> and hotel operator <span class="companylink">Highgate Hotels</span>, would be broken into pieces -- the land, the 1,300-room hotel and the 26,000-square-foot retail unit -- and sold for a combined value of about $650 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn investor David Werner, in partnership with <span class="companylink">Deutsche</span> Asset &amp; Wealth Management's real-estate investment business, has just bought the land for a reported $325 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Werner declined to comment on the acquisition, but Todd Henderson, head of real estate, Americas, at <span class="companylink">Deutsche</span> Asset &amp; Wealth Management, said <span class="companylink">Deutsche</span> was pleased to add "this high-quality investment to our client's portfolio."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Acquiring the leased fee interest in a prime New York City location is expected to provide strong and durable long-term returns," said Mr. Henderson in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Built in 1928, the 27-story hotel was once the largest hotel in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel, on Eight Avenue between West 44th and 45th streets, is currently undergoing a renovation that began in 2010. Rooms have already been upgraded, and the new 8,700-square-foot lobby will be completed by summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment is subject to a new 99-year ground lease, and <span class="companylink">Highgate Hotels</span> will continue to run the Milford Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Meridian Capital Group</span>, one of the nation's largest commercial real-estate finance and advisory firms, negotiated $275 million in permanent financing from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to fund the acquisition of the Milford Hotel land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings</span> provided a 10-year, fixed-rate, interest-only loan, negotiated by Abe Hirsch and Peter Steier of Meridian along with representatives of Eastdil Secured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically, David Werner has purchased many large historic assets. This was very much what he likes," said Mr. Hirsch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steier said there was heavy competition for the financing of the hotel, which took 60 days from initiation to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a deal of this caliber, it was fast," said Mr. Steier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of the Milford is the latest example of how demand for hotels is rising as a result of increased tourism. In 2012, there were 52 million visitors to New York City, with hotel occupancy at 86.5%, surpassing the 2007 peak of 85.8%, according to CBRE's 2012 New York hotel report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom McConnell, executive managing director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's hotel transactions group, said international visitation has changed dramatically over the last 10 years, and New York has been the great beneficiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's generational change. Lots of folks who never traveled before are now. And for the past 15 years, occupancy in New York City has been above 82%," Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hotels don't sell very often here, and demand for investment in hotels is greater than opportunities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McConnell also said the west side of Times Square is "just as good a place as any to be right now," adding that "Manhattan is moving west, and the Hudson Yards development will change the area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan hotel transaction volume reached $2.7 billion last year, the most for any global market, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 79, 802 hotel rooms in Manhattan, with another 30,867 rooms under various forms of planning and development in 2013, the CBRE report said. The average daily rate for Manhattan hotels was $283, compared with the 2008 peak of $313.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE estimates that Manhattan hotel capitalization rates are currently 4.5% to 5.5% for luxury, for 6% to 7% for full-service, 6.5% to 7.5% for select-service and for 8% to 9% for economy. Cap rates are calculated by dividing the annual net income of a property by its price to determine the return of an investment in a building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though the Milford Plaza isn't the greatest building in the world and it isn't the greatest hotel in the world, it's a great location," said Bradley Burwell, vice president of CBRE Hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Milford is a great piece of land, and the whole Eight Avenue corridor has increased in value," said Mr. Burwell. "Times Square is the center of New York lodging -- locals don't like it very much but tourists love it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago exchange operator <span class="companylink">CME Group Inc</span>. is considering selling the buildings that house its energy and grain trading floors in New York and Kansas City, Mo., in the latest sign that quick-fire computers are replacing iconic buildings as the markets' center of gravity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't certain the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span> would need to relocate if a deal is made, because <span class="companylink">CME</span> is considering a lease-back option on that property, which houses one of the few remaining exchange trading floors in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if <span class="companylink">CME</span> decides to sell, it could take advantage of a hot market for prime real estate in city centers, fueled by investors eager to vault the paltry yields offered by many other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the plan is yet another marker in the striking shift in financial markets toward electronic trading and away from the frenzied human activity that only recently made these locations teeming hubs of commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Nymex</span>, more than 1,000 floor traders gathered only a decade ago to haggle over energy and metal derivatives contracts. That number is closer to 100 today. Pit trading in Kansas City is relocating entirely to Chicago, ending a tradition that goes back more than 150 years to daily grain auctions on the banks of the Missouri River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While trades are still carried out in buildings such as the New York Stock Exchange and the art-deco Chicago Board of Trade, exchange companies have moved big parts of their operations from city-center locations to drabber suburban properties that house humming servers instead of screaming traders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CME spokeswoman said the company is "exploring different scenarios including a potential sale of the [<span class="companylink">Nymex</span>] building and lease-back of the trading space," but hasn't hired a broker to market the property. She confirmed the planned sale of the Kansas City property. The company has no plans to close the <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> trading floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nymex</span> moved to its 16-story tower on the southern tip of Manhattan near Battery Park in 1997. <span class="companylink">CME</span> acquired the building, which also is home to a number of energy-trading firms, through its $9.5 billion purchase of the exchange's parent in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> building sits on land owned by New York's <span class="companylink">Battery Park City Authority</span>, which <span class="companylink">CME</span> has leased until June 2069, according to regulatory filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> estimated the value of the building at $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office building rents and occupancies in major U.S. cities are still far from recovering the ground they lost during the downturn. But investors have bid up prices because trophy real estate is seen as an attractive investment in today's low-interest-rate environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of commercial property owned by U.S. real-estate investment trusts -- which tends to be higher quality -- is just 1% shy of 2007 peak levels, according to a commercial property index compiled by Green Street Advisors that was released earlier this month. Values have increased 60% since their nadir in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has convinced a number of companies to sell their buildings. <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>. sold its U.S. headquarters in Midtown Manhattan earlier this month to investors led by the Chetrit Group for $1.1 billion. The company now is leasing space in the building for up to three years, and looking for new office space in a cheaper location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CME</span> last year sold most of the CBOT building that is still home to its financial- and grain-trading pits and dozens of trading firms in downtown Chicago for $151.5 million, a move aimed at freeing up capital and reducing time spent managing its real-estate portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale followed <span class="companylink">CME</span>'s construction of a new data center, owned by the company, in the city's western suburbs to handle the needs of high-speed traders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> building also housed the New York Board of Trade, or Nybot, and its storied orange-juice pits until that trading floor was closed last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nybot had been the largest tenant in the <span class="companylink">Nymex</span> building, moving there after its former base was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The exchange was bought in 2006 by <span class="companylink">IntercontinentalExchange Inc</span>., which now plans to pull out of the building when its lease ends in mid-2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ICE, currently an all-electronic exchange, aims to lease space for Nybot traders to deal soft commodities contracts electronically a few blocks away at the New York Stock Exchange, which ICE in December agreed to buy as part of its $8.2 billion deal for parent <span class="companylink">NYSE Euronext</span>. Other ICE staff are moving to the company's midtown Manhattan offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CME</span>'s $126 million purchase last year of the Kansas City Board of Trade brought a 51% controlling interest in the building that has housed the exchange's wheat markets since 1966.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exchange group and <span class="companylink">Highwoods Properties Inc</span>., which owns the remainder of the building, are recruiting a real-estate broker to market the property, according to Glenn Stephenson, vice president of Highwoods and its divisional manager in Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month <span class="companylink">CME</span> announced plans to relocate trading in Kansas City-listed contracts to <span class="companylink">CME</span>'s Chicago trading floor and close the KCBT pits. <span class="companylink">CME</span> at the time committed to operating an "electronic trading center" on the Kansas City floor until the end of September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other exchanges that still operate open-outcry trading pits in the U.S. include the <span class="companylink">Chicago Board Options Exchange</span>, NYSE's Amex options market and Nasdaq OMX PHLX, formerly known as the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Stock Exchange</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned properties grew last month to the highest level in more than three years and more people put their properties up for sale, signs the housing market continues to improve ahead of the crucial spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 0.8% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.98 million, the highest level since November 2009, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Sales were 10.2% above the same month a year earlier, the 20th consecutive month of year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After contracting since last July, the number of homes on the market has started to increase as sales grow and prices recover. The inventory of previously owned homes listed for sale at the end of February increased 9.6% from January to 1.94 million; that represented a 4.7 month supply at the current sales pace, up from 4.3 months a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising inventories were a big economic drag during the recession and real-estate bust, the most recent rise is likely due to more people putting their homes on the market in response to higher prices. A separate report earlier this week showed that over the past year 1.7 million households regained equity in their homes in 2012, meaning that until recently they owed more on their mortgage than the home was worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now that you've had a year of price gains, some uptick in the level of inventory would reflect a better housing market. In some sense, it's a positive sign," said Michael Gapen, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, homes are selling faster, according to Thursday's release. It took a median 74 days for homes to be sold in February, compared with 97 days in the same period last year, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists believe the housing market will be one of the main drivers of the economy this year as inventories shrink further, prices rise and builders break ground on more projects. Single-family housing starts were at a nearly five-year high in February and were up more than 30% from the same period last year, the Commerce Department said earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential investment has boosted overall economic growth for seven consecutive quarters, adding 0.40 percentage point to overall economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year -- a period in which the economy grew by 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes sold in February was $173,600, up 11.6% from a year earlier. Compared with a month earlier, sales grew in the South and West but fell in the Northeast and the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices rise, the number of people who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth is declining, which could encourage them to sell their homes and buy new properties. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank's easy-money policies are helping the housing recovery gain traction.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cameron McWhirter </div><div>814 words</div><div>22 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the best sign yet that the U.S. housing market is recovering: plywood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing demand and tight supplies have pushed up plywood prices by 45% in the past year, and U.S. producers are scrambling to get back up to speed after slashing output of the basic construction material during the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia-Pacific, the largest U.S. producer of plywood, is expected to announce Friday it plans to invest about $400 million over the next three years to boost softwood plywood and lumber capacity by 20%. The company is hustling to meet growing needs of large customers such as <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. and <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., said Mark Luetters, executive vice president of the Atlanta-based company's building products division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia-Pacific, which has been owned by <span class="companylink">Koch Industries Inc</span>. since 2005, reduced its overall wood products capacity by at least 30% in the past five years, Mr. Luetters said, but now "demand has gotten ahead of production and production is trying to catch up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said plants have done what they can to add shifts and make smaller fixes to improve capacity, but now significant capital investment is needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The industry is kind of at the end of its rope," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia-Pacific, which also makes paper products and packaging materials, plans to revamp and expand plywood plants across the Southeast U.S. Mr. Luetters said he expects short-term construction jobs to be added but doesn't anticipate significant permanent jobs as a result of plant improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boise Cascade Co</span>., the second-largest producer of softwood plywood in the U.S., has added workers and shifts at its plants to meet strong demand for plywood, lumber and other wood products from an awakening building industry, although the company said it isn't planning a major expansion for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Boise Cascade</span> went public on Feb. 6, and the stock is up almost 60% from the IPO price of $21, closing Thursday at $33.54 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. softwood plywood consumption was cut almost in half during the recession, falling from 16.3 billion square feet in 2005 to 8.7 billion in 2009. It hit a low of 8.6 billion in 2011. As demand evaporated, plants were closed and workers were laid off throughout the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. construction business is finally looking up, though. Housing starts this February were up 27.2% from a year earlier, to at a seasonally adjusted rate of 917,000, according to government statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, plywood consumption crept back up to 8.8 billion, according to data collected by the APA-the Engineered Wood Association, a nonprofit trade association that tracks plywood production. The group forecasts consumption rising to 11.1 billion by 2016, said Craig Adair, the group's market research director. Only a small percentage of softwood plywood is imported, much of it from Chile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With demand rising, the composite price for structural panels, which includes plywood and other wood products, jumped to $511 per thousand square feet on March 15, up 45% from $351 in mid-March a year ago, according to Random Lengths, a Eugene, Ore., wood-products market reporting service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of a <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> home-improvement store in metro Atlanta on Thursday morning, Jarrett Barnes, an independent contractor, loaded his Toyota Tundra truck with lumber and building materials for the day's job. The 25-year-old Mr. Barnes, who has been a contractor for eight years, said the last five years have been tough, but that business -- mostly for remodeling jobs -- has picked up in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has about 50% more work than he did in March 2012. But as work has increased, prices for materials have shot up, especially in the last few months. He said he has no choice but to pass the costs onto his customers, but he hopes costs go down soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They give you a funny look but what can you do?" he said of his customers. "You tell them they can go check the prices themselves."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta-based <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> doesn't anticipate any product shortages and is working "with our vendors to plan well in advance for consumer demand," said spokeswoman Jean Niemi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia-Pacific said its added capacity likely will be in place by late 2014 or early 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Butzelaar, forest products marketing consultant for International Wood Markets Group in Vancouver, said that during the last five years, "a lot of capacity has been either removed or idled with the housing market collapse," and now companies have no choice but to expand to meet demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis </div><div>1338 words</div><div>22 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to live abroad? Americans who get a mortgage from an overseas lender can end up with lower interest rates, more lenient repayment terms and tax perks to boot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, mortgages in Europe have become more appealing as interest rates have declined. Rates on 15-year jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages offered by retail banks average 2.66% and change annually, says Miranda John, international manager at SPF Private Clients, a London-based mortgage brokerage firm that works with affluent buyers world-wide. In the U.S., few lenders offer this loan, but there are 30-year mortgages with an average 2.96% rate, changing annually, according to Riverdale, N.J.-based mortgage info website HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on home loans in Europe have been dropping as the three-month euro interbank offered rate that they're often pegged to was roughly 0.2% this month, down from about 1.3% in the beginning of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terms can be more generous in other countries. In Switzerland, where the base rate for mortgages is currently 0%, jumbo mortgages are being offered starting at about 1.5% for a fixed rate for three years, Ms. John says. Borrowers there often have the option to pay just interest each month plus 1% to 3% of the principal amount annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For affluent borrowers, the lower monthly payments required from such mortgages allow them to put the cash they would have paid toward the home to work in other, higher-yielding investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other countries, U.S. luxury buyers will find better rates than the locals get. Rates on 15-to-25-year jumbo mortgages for Americans buying in the Caribbean range from 4% to 4.25% on average and remain fixed for the first three years before becoming variable, says Anita Ashton, director of Caribbean Mortgage Services, a mortgage brokerage based in Barbados. (Like U.S. mortgages, these loan rates are often pegged to the London interbank offered rate.) In contrast, Caribbean locals currently receive rates mostly ranging from 6% to 9%, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no statistics on how many affluent Americans sign up for mortgages abroad, but experts in some markets say it's a small figure that has been rising over the past year. Across the Caribbean in 2012, Ms. Ashton says, she distributed jumbo mortgages to roughly a dozen American vacation-home buyers, up from two the year prior. "More people are now taking mortgages than they were previously, especially in the $1 [million] to $3 million range," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Americans should be prepared for extra legwork when buying overseas. Most U.S. lenders don't offer mortgages for properties located outside the country. And local lenders in some countries are unwilling to work with foreigners. Those that welcome American clients can't always provide loans large enough for luxury homes. And lenders who originate jumbo mortgages may require three or more years of financial statements, which some buyers may not want to reveal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affluent buyers may be able to tap into an existing relationship they have with a global bank. For instance, clients who have assets in the U.S. with banks, including <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, can often arrange to get a mortgage from the same institution if it has offices in the country where they're buying a vacation home. Joseph D'Alessio, a mortgage consultant with <span class="companylink">HSBC Bank USA</span>, says the company will connect those clients with the <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> office abroad in the country where they're trying to get a mortgage. In most cases, large banks will also consider new clients for such referral services if they set up an account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers will need to be prepared for some less-than-appealing loan terms as well. In many countries, repayment periods tend to be shorter, often ranging from three to 15 years. With interest-only mortgages, borrowers are often able to renew the loans -- which often have repayment periods of five to seven years -- at the end of the term, although most lenders in Europe require mortgages to be repaid by the time the borrower is 70.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who don't want to deal with such hassles have other options for raising cash. Rather than withdrawing from their savings or liquidating assets, they can sign up for loans pegged to their U.S.-based assets. San Francisco-based <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>, which is owned by <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, says its affluent clients who buy real estate abroad could tap a line of credit secured by their investment portfolio with the bank. They can also use funds from a home-equity line of credit or home-equity loan on their U.S. home to pay cash for a purchase abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, borrowers who own a U.S. home outright or have significant equity in it can consider a cash-out refinance, in which they get a new rate on their mortgage while withdrawing equity, and use that money to buy a home abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before proceeding, buyers should consult an accountant to find out the tax implications that will accompany their purchase. Americans can deduct mortgage interest payments on their second home, even if it's abroad, as long as the combined balances of the mortgages on their first and second homes don't exceed $1.1 million. For many affluent buyers, that cap could be too low. Separately, Americans who own a residence abroad in their individual names don't have to report it on their U.S. tax returns, as long as they don't rent it out -- a strategy that helps affluent individuals avoid disclosing that asset to the <span class="companylink">IRS</span>, says Don Nelson, a Dana Point, Calif.-based tax attorney and certified public accountant whose clients include Americans abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How they pay for the home will also affect their taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who withdraw equity from their U.S. home in a cash-out refinancing and use that money to buy a luxury home abroad can't deduct much, if any, interest on that portion of the loan in the U.S. And depending on the country they're in, they could get hit with extra taxes there. For instance, Americans who own a home outright in France -- even if they actually used a loan from the U.S. to purchase it -- will have to pay an extra annual tax on a property if it's worth more than 1.3 million euros ($1.7 million), says Ms. John of SPF Private Clients. But if they sign up for a French mortgage, it would count as debt against the asset and could help them avoid this tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are other issues to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Euro-zone woes: While luxury real estate in countries facing economic headwinds, such as Italy, Spain and Portugal, is selling at a discount, affluent borrowers will find few lenders in these countries willing to originate jumbo mortgages. They'll often charge higher rates, especially in areas with a lot of listings and unfinished developments, says Ms. John.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Down payments vary: Lenders will generally require at least a 20% down payment, but that could rise to 50% in countries in an economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Closer inspection of credit: Lenders in the Caribbean often look beyond traditional paperwork to include applicants' credit-card statements to determine lending amounts. Even if borrowers don't use their cards, lenders will assume they spend 3% of their total credit limit each month, which lowers the amount they'll give in a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Overseas restrictions: In some areas, actually buying land isn't possible. Many countries in Asia, for instance, don't permit foreigners to own land. In Thailand, Americans are mostly restricted to condos, while in Vietnam, foreigners who become residents can get a lease of up to 50 years.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Saabira Chaudhuri   </div><div>418 words</div><div>21 March 2013</div><div>13:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> posted a narrower fiscal-first-quarter loss as it benefited from double-digit increases in deliveries and selling prices for its houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the Los Angeles-based company's net orders rose 40% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement for one the largest U.S. home builders comes as the housing market enters the all-important spring selling season, which has the potential to be the strongest in several years. Builders are benefiting as buyers leave the sidelines and as interest rates remain low, making owning a home more affordable than renting in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> has lagged behind its peers in part because the company had fewer sales communities open. Analysts had said <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> would need to move aggressively early in 2013 in order to generate order growth in line with other home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended Feb. 29, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported net orders jumped to 1,671 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the builder reported a loss of $12.5 million, or 16 cents a share, versus a year-earlier loss of $45.8 million, or 59 cents a share. There was no inventory write-down in the latest quarter, compared with $6.6 million impairment charge a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue rose 59% to $405.2 million, with growth across all the company's home-building regions. <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>'s operations are focused in the Central U.S. and the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said the revenue growth was driven by both higher deliveries and increased pricing power, reflecting the company's land repositioning initiatives and a shift in consumer demand to larger homes. The company has been shifting its focus to first-time and first "move-up" home buyers in higher-income areas with tighter housing supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> reported a 29% increase in home deliveries and a 24% increase in the average selling price, to $271,300 a home, which is its highest first-quarter price since 2006. Costs and expenses rose 42%, but its home-building gross profit margin widened to 14.8% from 8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancellation rate fell to 32% from 36% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backlog value jumped 53%. The number of homes in the backlog rose 25% to 2,763 at the quarter's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> said it had teamed up with mortgage servicer <span class="companylink">Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc</span>. to form a mortgage banking services firm in a bid to expand its mortgage service offerings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York could have its answer to San Francisco's Ferry Building or Boston's Faneuil Hall Marketplace -- a waterfront public market where people shop for fresh fish, grab a loaf of artisanal bread or take in a dozen oysters at lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developer Howard Hughes Corp. has agreed to create a 10,000-square-foot market in the South Street Seaport, bowing to a last-minute community push to include the amenity in a project to develop the Tin and New Market buildings at the historic Fulton Fish Market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concession was one of several made by Howard Hughes in order to receive approval for its plan to redevelop a 200,000-square-foot shopping center on Pier 17 -- the first part of an agreement with the city to redevelop the South Street Seaport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modifications to the city's lease with Howard Hughes also will allow Pier 17 businesses to stay open year-round rather than just through the busy summer season to help them recover from superstorm Sandy and give the public access to the development's rooftop. The developer also agreed to build a second market in the Pier 17 building by Oct. 1, 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes were announced hours before the project received final City Council approval Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will no longer be one of the only major cities in the world without a destination market," City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said at a news conference announcing the deal. "We want to try to preserve them and make them into something that will be a permanent benefit to the city and a permanent part of the city's food economy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The once-thriving Fulton Fish Market has remained vacant since the fishmongers who had long used the space moved to the Bronx in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is good news that the Tin Building that's been shuttered will have life again," said Catherine McVay-Hughes, chairwoman of local Community Board 1. "There is no seven-day-a-week, year-round local food market downtown. It's something . . . the residents, workers and businesses in the area have a need for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mandate passed by the city Wednesday says that any proposal for a mixed-use development at the Tin Building must include a food market with at least 10,000 square feet of floor space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules also lay out what kinds of purveyors can be housed in the building, with stalls going exclusively to growers and producers of local, regionally sourced foods such as produce, meat and fish as well as artisanal pastas, honeys and condiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Hughes has until the end of June to decide it wants to redevelop the site of the New Market and Tin buildings. If not, it would be up to the city to find a new developer for the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our vision for a revitalized South Street Seaport has taken an important step forward today," David Weinreb, chief executive of Howard Hughes, said in a statement. "I am particularly pleased because the redevelopment will have a catalytic effect on Lower Manhattan and help the area continue to recover from the impact of Hurricane Sandy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company declined to comment on whether is will exercise its option for the Fulton Fish Market buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the city has a handful of indoor markets like the Chelsea and Essex Street markets, bringing some kind of large-scale public market back to the South Street Seaport has long part of a vision for the space laid out by the City Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also has been the desire of advocates led by the New Amsterdam Market, which has operated a Sunday market in the parking lot of the Tin Building from April to December during the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group set out to show city leaders that a market at the site was sustainable and would help bring New Yorkers to shop in an area that in recent years has become almost exclusively a tourist destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success led New Amsterdam leaders to increase their push to preserve the space, gaining the support of some of the city's well-known chefs, including April Bloomfield, Daniel Boulud and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday, hundreds of supporters crammed a City Council committee hearing to discuss the Howard Hughes plans for the Pier 17 site, forcing the committee to postpone and move it to a room large enough to hold the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day later, Howard Hughes officials met with Ms. Quinn and City Council Member Margaret Chin, whose district houses the South Street Seaport. The developer was told it would need to include a market at Fulton Fish Market site in order to move forward with the Pier 17 plan, Ms. Chin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indoor market will be modeled after similar public markets in Seattle, San Francisco and London, which are destination spots and incubators for small businesses and jobs, Ms. Chin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the city envisions a market with a model similar to one used currently by the New Amsterdam Market -- independent, small businesses that source food from a 500-mile region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's a model that everybody is looking toward," Ms. Chin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert LaValva, president of the New Amsterdam Market, noted that markets in San Francisco, Seattle and London are much larger than the one approved for Fulton Fish Market space, but he called the decision a victory for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's a really great amenity to have a regional food market of that size in that neighborhood," he said, "In terms of what we have been promoting, it's more like a mini version of it."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York -- New Yorkers shouldering their way through Grand Central Terminal's trench-coated crowds, braving the high-heel-grabbing grates along Lexington Avenue or coursing the taxi slalom around the Met Life and Helmsley buildings may not be following the hotly contested plans for rezoning Midtown East. But they experience the area's chaos, deficiencies and declining glamour that the new zoning code aims to correct, ushering in a new age of commercial glory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Covering 78 blocks that fan out around Grand Central and up Park Avenue, from East 39th Street to East 57th Street, and from Fifth Avenue as far as Second Avenue, the rezoning proposal was first presented by the Department of City Planning in July 2012 and updated with more details on Feb. 28. The proposal hopes to trigger a wave of new upscale office buildings -- projections expect about 20 by 2033 -- along with green spaces and improved transit connections. According to the presentation, the rezoning plan aims to "strengthen and protect East Midtown as one of the world's premier business addresses." It's an ambitious proposal that strives to be inclusive but, as past missteps in this commercial core of New York show, zoning should not be mistaken for long-term comprehensive planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1982 rezoning to move development west to Times Square worked all too well, significantly tamping down growth in Midtown East, now at a pitiable 0.06% over the past decade. A 1992 effort to encourage development around Grand Central by zoning a special district to encourage the sale of air rights failed abysmally. The new zoning will have to rejigger -- or risk joining -- these past miscalculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As usual, developers are pitted against preservationists. The former have long griped about the overstock of shabby Class B buildings, where floors are crowded with columns and cramped by low ceilings, and where even basic central air conditioning has to be installed. They endorse rezoning for increased density -- permitting, in particular, a cluster of five to six buildings, 700 to 900 feet tall (the Chrysler Building is 1,046 feet), west of Grand Central around Vanderbilt Avenue, with slightly smaller towers marching up Park. Added bonuses could allow for a few sites to build skyscrapers well over 1,000 feet tall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservationists worry that too many big buildings will destroy the historic fabric and iconic allure of Midtown. They advocate the speedy designation of 20 to 30 more buildings as landmarks, among them the Graybar Building, Yale Club and Roosevelt Hotel, adding to the 23 already with such status, including the Chrysler Building, Seagram Building and Lever House. At a recent public unveiling of a report critical of the rezoning, Vin Cipolla, president of the Municipal Art Society, said permitting such tall towers would create a new silhouette for Midtown that was "scary" and would "change the fundamental feeling of blocks like 42nd Street."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its own scathing report issued on Feb. 27, the Real Estate Board of New York, a professional trade association, called the new contenders for landmark status just placeholders and "middle of the pack design." Change itself, the report said, is the defining characteristic of Midtown. But even London's office buildings are younger -- an average 40 years old to Midtown's 73. "If we say our best days are behind us, then we are doomed," said Vishaan Chakrabarti, executive director of the Center for Urban Real Estate, a <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Midtown desperately needs revitalization. The merits of individual buildings should not be the only issue. The whole area deserves architectural distinction, at every scale -- street lamps or skyscraper silhouettes, public or private space. Reasonable people don't reject new buildings outright; they oppose bad design and monotonous, oversize boxes. And that's all too often what contemporary glass behemoths turn out to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to be truly urban by today's standards, Midtown East needs texture and variety, different scales and mixed uses, green spaces and reliable infrastructure. It remains uncertain whether the rezoning proposal can deliver this, or aims to be as comprehensive as it could be. Oriented fixedly on office buildings, the plan currently contains no provisions to encourage residential building; its argument is that more than a million square feet of residential development are already in the works. The Department of City Planning report even cites conversion to hotels and condos as one of the drags on the ability of Midtown East to compete with the likes of Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The competitive edge argument is ridiculous: Hong Kong wants to be New York," said Robert A.M. Stern, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, and architect of a new building in downtown Hong Kong. "Why not focus on repurposing the area as truly mixed use? Right now, the plan is not visionary enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its ambition is too narrowly focused. Impressive architecture is slated for only three sites -- two on Vanderbilt Avenue, and one on Park Avenue between 55th and 56th streets -- where developers could seek special permits to build towers more than 1,000 feet tall, as long as they are "extraordinary buildings" of "global distinction," "exhibiting significant contributions to the skyline." Why not insist that shorter office buildings be distinctive, too? Linking quality to bonus bulk and height sounds like a bribe, not a truly aspirational plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are to be green spaces along Vanderbilt Avenue, and eventually along Park Avenue as far as East 57th Street. In fact, Vanderbilt would be closed to traffic to make way for a plaza as soon as funds are available. Community members rightly wonder why dressing up this meager side street is a priority over urgent if less glamorous upgrades, such as widening the sidewalks on Lexington Avenue. It sounds more like a lure to attract developers for those "extraordinary buildings" than a real public plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All improvements, whether on Vanderbilt or on the below-grade subway platforms, is quite innovative. All improvements would be funded by a so-called District Improvement Bonus generated only as building permits are issued. The mandatory DIB is estimated to generate on average $50 million per new building (at a rate of $250 per square foot), to be spent exclusively on the public realm. Sounds great, and developers are accustomed to this kind of pay-to-play, but the plan is based on an untested model devised for the unbuilt Hudson Yards development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the streets and subway stations of Midtown are in appalling condition right now. More people power through Lexington Avenue's subway lines in the course of a day than use the entire Metro in Washington. The Long Island East Side Access project, now under construction, will allow <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> commuters to travel to a new terminus in Grand Central. When it is completed in 2019, some 160,000 people will join the 750,000 daily commuters already fighting like salmon to get up the stairs to Lexington and Madison avenues during rush hour. But there won't be money in the DIB fund until at least then, when the first buildings get under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Department of City Planning will be releasing more detailed design guidelines on April 8 in its race to get the rezoning certified before the Bloomberg administration disperses. Increasing density is smart and necessary, especially near a transportation hub as solid as Grand Central, but there needs to be equal pressure applied to making sure that district-wide development is of the highest quality, encompassing a richer mix of scales and uses, to ensure that Midtown is once again glamorous from curb to storefront to skyscraper spire.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values have lifted more borrowers out of the hole of owing more than their properties are worth, an encouraging sign for an economy still closely tied to the health of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of "underwater" homeowners in the fourth quarter of 2012 declined by 1.7 million from a year earlier, meaning 1.7 million U.S. households have regained home equity, according to data released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a research company. Overall, the company said 21.5% of households with a mortgage were underwater at the end of 2012, down from 25.2% at the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When consumers have equity in their homes, they feel more optimistic about their finances and become more likely to spend money on other goods and services, which helps boost the economy. Having equity also makes it easier for homeowners to take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages, which frees up cash that can then be used on other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home equity is the biggest source of wealth, so if equity is increasing that has a very large effect on household spending and consumer psychology," said Sam Khater, an economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, adding that this knock-on effect filters down to everyone from real-estate agents to furniture stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining number of underwater households is one of several changing housing trends that have made real estate a much bigger contributor to economic growth. After dragging on growth since 2006, the portion of gross domestic product that includes homebuilding contributed just over a quarter of a percentage point to the nation's growth last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the things that fed on the downside feed positively on the upside," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some newly above-water households are just barely at breakeven and therefore are a long way off from being able to change their finances in any significant way. And the overall ranks of those underwater remain large, at about 10.4 million, down from 12.1 million at the end of 2011, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for those whose lives were put on hold while their homes were upside down, moving above water has come as a huge relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Oropeza is one of them. In 2009, the 30-year-old business-systems analyst paid $96,000 for his Phoenix home. Over the next two years, he watched prices continue to fall, until similar homes in his area were selling for as low as $64,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realizing he was underwater, and not wanting to lose his 15% down payment, Mr. Oropeza says he turned down a number of job opportunities in places including Pennsylvania and Oklahoma. "I decided I didn't want to short sell and I didn't want to take the loss," he says. "It was going to take a couple years of work just to pay the debt of the house so it was like, 'Am I really progressing here?' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, after Mr. Oropeza's employer required him to move to an office in Orange County, Calif., he finally gave in and called real-estate agent Greg Markov, who specializes in short sales. "We reviewed the numbers and I told him, 'I got good news. I think this is going to be a breakeven thing and you might be able to walk away with some money,' " said Mr. Markov. Mr. Oropeza has a $105,000 offer on the home and expects to close the sale within two weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices are rising in most markets across the country, few have seen as big a rise as Phoenix, which was among the nation's hardest-hit markets during the bust. According to the closely watched Case-Shiller home-price index, prices in Phoenix jumped 23% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices started to firm in Phoenix last year as investors poured into the market to buy heavily discounted homes for cash. Those gains have steeply reduced the inventory of homes for sale to just over two months' supply at the current sales pace, according to The Wall Street Journal's quarterly housing survey. The shortage has pushed prices even further by increasing buyer competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so little inventory to sell, Luis Solis, a Phoenix real-estate agent, is hoping the home-equity revival will entice more sellers into the market. Mr. Solis recently printed up flyers that he plans to send to select homeowners in the downtown Phoenix area where he specializes. His pitch includes two similar homes that sold for more than the current residents paid. The message: If you think you're underwater, think again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who just a couple years ago were 150 grand underwater, and depending on the price, they're even now," says Mr. Solis. "I want to get specific with people. This is a way to get their attention."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction is showing strength heading into real estate's key spring sales season. Housing starts climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 917,000 in February, up 0.8% from January. Building permits, which are less vulnerable to winter effects than starts, also gained, rising 4.6% last month. The strong results reflect the housing sector's slow but steady recovery.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rich are back, spending as much or more than ever on New York real estate, though a bit more discreetly than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the finding of a new report on the strong luxury real-estate market last year, amid signs that the pace of high-end deal making is picking up further in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, by <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>, found that co-op and townhouse sales of $5 million or more hit a record in 2012, exceeding totals in 2008, the peak year for Manhattan before the financial crisis stalled sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium sales closed in 2012 lagged behind their totals in earlier years, but brokers said that may be due in part to a rush of contracts signed for new luxury condos in buildings that are still under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While there is no law of nature requiring that what comes down must go back up, the luxury residential $5 million plus market in Manhattan certainly has done just that," said Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage who prepared the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Henckels said that after the demise of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings</span> in the fall of 2008, wealthy buyers operated on the basis of fear and only bought when they came across a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, citing market research, he said the wealthy still want to keep a lower profile, but are willing to spend more on homes and other luxuries that provide value and quality and improve "their personal and family lives, even at full asking price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This translated into top prices in 2012 for Manhattan co-ops and condos, a shift that some brokers see as a reaffirmation of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy people who had been buying big places outside New York -- in Florida or the Hamptons, for example -- are now deciding to stay in New York "and be comfortable and have a big home," said Dolly Lenz, a luxury broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wealthy international buyers interested in American real estate are looking for something more than value, said Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of them are not just looking at this as a place to dump their cash," she said. "They want a place they can use and enjoy when they come to New York, many of them have family here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest closed sale of 2012 was the $88 million sale of a condo penthouse at 15 Central Park West, on the corner of West 62nd Street. It was sold by Sanford Weill, the former chairman of Citigroup, to the family of a Russian billionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during 2012, Extell Development reported that two buyers had signed contracts for even higher prices: at least $90 million for full-floor duplex penthouses near the top of the 1,004-foot-high One57, a new condominium under construction on West 57th Street across from Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record high for a co-op was set in November by David Geffen, the music executive. when he paid $54 million to Denise Rich, the socialite for a penthouse at 785 Fifth Ave. near East 60th Street. The top townhouse sale of the year was the $42 million sale of a mansion at 973 Fifth Ave. designed by Stanford White.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a fourth-floor co-op owned by Adam Clayton, the U2 bass player, was sold for about $8.85 million -- about $150,000 over the asking price -- at the Eldorado on Central Park West and West 90th Street showing the strength of the market. The buyer was identified by brokers as Bruce Willis; the apartment has seven windows facing Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emma Kerins, a broker at Halstead Property who had the listing, said there were several bidders for the Clayton apartment. She said prices were being pushed higher because of a shortage of "good apartments, in very solid buildings with direct park views."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new element in the market is the strong sales in developments still under construction that are targeted at very wealthy buyers. These deals -- about $2.5 billion or more in these luxury apartments may now be in contract, according to reports from developers -- but may not close for many months or years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, two new downtown buildings officially launched sales, and quickly reported very strong results. At 150 Charles St. in the West Village, a condo that combines a converted warehouse with two new 16-story wings, reported 60 of its 91 apartments in contract, with a total value of more than $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> who is overseeing sales there, said the signed contracts now include a $34 million penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attributed the strong sales to the "low-key luxury" favored by the wealthy today. "Crystal chandeliers and marble lobbies are not what buyers are looking for today," he said. "They want rich, warm character."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther downtown in TriBeCa, the developer of a 57-story tower of stacked boxes known as 56 Leonard St., announced that buyers had signed contracts for more than half the 145 condos since it officially launched sales last month. Contracts totaled more than $450 million, according to Alexico Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've never witnessed so much pent up demand," said Kelly Mack, president of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling marketing and sales for the building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Construction of single-family homes in the U.S. rose to a nearly five-year high in February, the latest sign of an improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building, which made up two-thirds of housing starts last month, increased 0.5% in February to a rate of 618,000 units, the highest level since June 2008. Single-family home construction has risen 31.5% in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall housing starts rose 0.8% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 917,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. January's figures were revised upward to a rate of 910,000. February's level matched economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of new building permits, an indication of future construction, rose 4.6% to an annualized level of 946,000 in February, also the highest level since June 2008. That was above economists' estimates for a rate of 925,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvements in the housing market will be one of the main drivers of the economy this year, economists believe. Investments in residential projects and home improvements have contributed to overall economic growth for seven consecutive quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, rising costs for building materials and fewer construction lots available may slow construction in the coming months. Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said members' confidence fell in March for the second straight month and is at its lowest level since October. But builders said they are seeing stronger interest from potential buyers and are more optimistic about the market over the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce data showed new home building was mixed in the four U.S. regions last month. Construction on new homes rose 37.5% in the Midwest and 18.4% in the Northeast but dropped 7.2% in the West and 5.7% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual housing starts, which are calculated without seasonal adjustments, increased to 62,400 in February from a downwardly revised 59,700 for the prior month. Lumber and commodities markets watch those numbers closely to gauge demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Carmel Melouney </div><div>887 words</div><div>18 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may not be as fashionable as Chelsea or as hip as the Lower East Side, but to property investors, the Upper West Side is where it's at right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have flocked to the neighborhood, despite very low capitalization rates. The cap rate is calculated by dividing the annual net income of a property by its price to determine what an investment in a building yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of commercial real-estate investment sales activity, the Upper West Side is far outpacing the East Village, Chelsea and Williamsburg, according to a report by Eastern Consolidated, a brokerage and research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily sales volume on the Upper West Side averaged 2.6% of the total Manhattan sales volume between 2005 and 2011, but in 2012, it was 7.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of multifamily rental properties increased threefold in 2012 over 2011. Total volume in all of Manhattan increased only 3% for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investor interest in the Upper West Side was strong in 2005, it started to drop off in 2006 when other areas such as Chelsea and the West Village drew more attention, said Eastern Consolidated chief economist Barbara Byrne Denham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't have the trendiness of Chelsea, or the night life, but it has families, and long-term residents," Ms. Denham said of the Upper West Side's stability. "Despite low cap rates, investors know it's a good deal. It's definitely a long-term strategy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall Oster, first vice president of sales at Massey Knakal, closed 12 Upper West Side deals in 2012, the strongest year since the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had properties that traded at almost nil cap rates based on very low rents," Mr. Oster said. "But [buyers] see the future investment potential, they're not looking at it based on today's rent roll."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massey Knakal is currently handling 14 assignments representing 21 properties in the neighborhood. Wedged between Central Park and Riverside Park, with <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> to the north, the geographical limits of the neighborhood mean investors know they are buying into constrained supply, and their investments will be protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, cap rates for elevator buildings on the Upper West Side are between 2% and 3.5%, while walk-up buildings are ranging between 3.5% and 4.5%, said Mr. Oster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite low returns right now, investing in property in areas like the Upper West Side is a stable option, said Mark Scott, president of Commercial Mortgage Capital, one of the most active multifamily mortgage brokers in the tri-state area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What are the alternatives? Treasury bonds for 2%, or you could buy <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> stock and earn 4%, or you can invest in real estate and get 3% or 4% now, then when these existing rent-controlled tenants are out, get a much better return," Mr. Scott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On New Year's Eve, Manhattan-based property owners Albert and Robert Gilardian of the Gilar Group paid $47 million for the 12-story building at 2410-2418 Broadway at a cap rate of 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, which has 46 apartments and 4,300 square feet of retail space and is situated on the corner of West 89th Street, was sold below the asking price of $52.5 million. It had been owned for 70 years by a 13-person partnership, M.E. &amp; A. Realty Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a very simple answer as to why investors would buy this property at a cap rate of 1% -- it has tremendous upside potential. These are five- and six-room classic apartments," said Amit Doshi, executive director of Besen &amp; Associates who handled the deal along with brokers from Eastern Consolidated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doshi said the building has 46 residential units, 71% of which are rent regulated with average monthly rents of $1,294.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These apartments have very, very low rents but can go for $5,000 to $7,000 a month," Mr. Doshi said. "In the short term you're making 1%, but this building will have a higher cap rate than other buildings being sold at higher rates now within the next five years," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Gilardian, asked why he would invest so much in a property with a 1% cap rate, said: "Basically, we buy for the future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, "We think the rent on that neighborhood is coming up. The appreciation real estate has compared with any other business is really much brighter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both real-estate investment trusts and institutional investors have bought into the Upper West Side, said Ms. Denham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2012, <span class="companylink">UDR Inc</span>., a multifamily real-estate investment trust, joined with <span class="companylink">MetLife Inc</span>. to purchase the multifamily portion of the five-tower apartment complex at Columbus Square along Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets. The price was $630 million, or $890,000 a unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the year, Eastern Consolidated brokered the sale of the Chatsworth, the 139-unit, 200,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts building at West 72nd Street. HFZ Capital bought the building for $150 million from owners who had held the property for more than 70 years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The construction cranes that have crowded this city's skyline for the past few years were symbols of its red-hot apartment market. But now, the sight of them could be an ominous sign of overbuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year alone, developers are expected to deliver more than 15,000 new apartment units in the greater metro area, with 11,000 more expected in 2014. That is well above the more than 6,000 units delivered, on average, each year during the prior decade, according to research firm Delta Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers flocked to the nation's capital after the financial crisis, based in part on the area's longtime reputation as being recession-resistant, due to the high number of federal employees, as well as contractors and consultants that cater to the government. Unlike private enterprises, which tend to trim their workforces during economic downturns, the federal government usually keeps its employees during good times and bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new supply of rentals is coming just as the sequester -- a package of $85 billion in cuts to defense and domestic programs that went into effect earlier this month -- threatens to drag on the area's recovery by reducing spending and eliminating jobs. While the number of jobs lost remains to be seen, estimates range from hundreds of thousands to one million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal spending accounts for about one-fifth of the economic output of the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, according to the Pew Center on the States, a nonpartisan research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, an oversupply of new apartments is taking hold. The growth in rental prices is slowing, developers are canceling or scaling back projects, and more landlords are concentrating on lower-priced units to compete with the glut of high-priced apartments expected to hit the market over the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Washington is a temptress. It's a trap. The historic stability of the area induces both financiers and developers to move forward with projects that they might hesitate to build in almost any other market," said Anirban Basu, chief executive of economic consultancy <span class="companylink">Sage Policy Group Inc</span>. "At some point there simply are not enough warm bodies to fill all the units that they're building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Washington remains one of the nation's most educated and affluent markets, and many developers expect government jobs to drive demand for apartments for years to come. That's why some developers say they aren't worried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Long term, all of the new D.C. supply will do just fine," said Jeffrey Friedman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Associated Estates Realty Corp</span>., which has purchased almost 2,000 Washington-area units in the past few years and has a community under development in nearby Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many developers who have recently completed projects have focused on so-called Class A apartment buildings, filled with pricey amenities such as outdoor kitchens and fancy gyms, which developers hope will translate into higher monthly rents. Hot submarkets include NoMa, which is north of the Capitol and boasts a new Metro stop, and the Roslyn-Ballston corridor in Arlington, Va., a walkable community filled with young residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While landlords managed a 1.9% increase in rent prices last year -- down from 2010's 7.8% incline -- this year could show the first drop since 2009, Delta reports. The vacancy rate for these high-end apartments could jump from the current 4.2% to 5.9% in 2014, according to Delta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Camden Property Trust</span>, a Houston-based company with nearly 6,000 units in the Washington area, didn't pursue building three apartment communities in the suburbs because it was jittery about all the new supply, said Chief Executive Ric Campo. While the firm currently has two projects under development, he said, "we have definitely slowed our pipeline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other operators have focused on building less-expensive apartments. <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities Inc</span>., a large national landlord, just opened its first property designed under its AVA brand geared to younger renters, on a site in Washington's rapidly gentrifying H Street area. The original site of AVA H Street had zoning approval for an eight-story, 180-unit building, which would require a concrete and steel frame. But AvalonBay decided to build a smaller building with a wooden frame to keep costs -- and by extension, rents -- low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At "every new [upscale] deal that gets built, everyone's adding the latest thing they can dream up as an amenity, and that just gets more expensive," said Jonathan Cox, a senior vice president with AvalonBay. "We priced this project from day one, between $250 and $350 [a month] lower in every unit type than our competitors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Suissa, director of sales at rental brokerage DC Apartment Co., said more buildings are disguising rent reductions as free first months or other perks. "You'd be hard-pressed to find a building that has not reduced rents," he said. "They're offering parking spaces and washer-dryers so people will sign the lease instead of shopping around."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Housing-Bubble Redux Any Time Soon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are we in a new housing bubble?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One unscientific way to dismiss that fear is to know that people swept up in one don't usually ask that question. While real-estate values may not warrant much more than a rise slightly faster than inflation, housing as an industry still could get much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index for March due Monday. The index, which fell one point a month ago to 46, could tick closer to 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is surprising is that it isn't even higher, because this is a diffusion index based on a survey of builder expectations for current and future home sales. Like surveys from the Institute for Supply Management, a reading above 50 indicates expansion. The index averaged an exuberant 68 from 2004 through 2005 but fell to a despondent 8 in early 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The absolute level of building activity still has more room to recover after a collapse in residential construction soaked up much of the boom-era excess. Based on a survey by Dow Jones Newswires, February housing starts and building permits due Tuesday should rise to 940,000 and 920,000, respectively, on an annualized basis, from 890,000 and 902,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits fell to a little more than 500,000 in the spring of 2009 and were still below 700,000 a year ago. The big improvement since hasn't left them very high in absolute terms, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long run, building permits track household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1998 and 2002, a preboom period that included a mild recession, they averaged 1.65 million a year. Adjusted for today's population, the same pace would imply 1.82 million permits a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, indexes of home-builder stocks, which have more than doubled in the last year and a half, seem to fully anticipate further improvement. Home builders such as <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>. trade at an average of around 24 times the next 12 months' forecast earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A better avenue for investors to benefit from further housing improvement may be through lumber, furniture or appliance and home-improvement retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even without a bubble, some corners of the market are starting to exhibit froth.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ian Sherr </div><div>765 words</div><div>14 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A13D</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley has long been on the cutting edge of technology, but has never been known for its architectural flair. Hao Ko is one of those trying to change that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco architect with the architectural design and consulting firm Gensler is leading a team that is designing two giant triangles in Silicon Valley. The structures, which will have a total of a million square feet of office space, will serve as part of the Santa Clara headquarters of chipmaker <span class="companylink">Nvidia Corp</span>. when the first building opens in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko, 41 years old, a California native and graduate of both the University of California at Berkeley and <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>, said the initial design for the space went through 10 iterations before landing on the pair of triangles. The triangles represent the tiny shapes that are a fundamental building block in generating 3-D images on computer screens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span> project comes amid a wave of other futuristic offices being built by local technology giants. <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. is building a spaceship-like circular building in Cupertino, while <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. recently unveiled a new campus design for its Mountain View employees, and <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>. has commissioned architect Frank Gehry to design a new building for its Menlo Park campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko has also worked on other well-known commercial projects, including a new executive briefing center for <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Co</span>. in Palo Alto, and Shanghai Tower, which will be one of the largest buildings in China once it is constructed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko recently discussed Silicon Valley's new commercial architecture. Edited excerpts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Why are Silicon Valley's buildings so bland?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko: I think Silicon Valley has just grown up really fast. I think it was not too long ago that Silicon Valley was thoroughly farmland and orchards. Like any urban environment, they're trying to build these buildings very quickly to house the companies moving in there. It just doesn't have as deep a history as a place like San Francisco, or Paris or New York, where you go through many, many iterations of buildings and it grows a certain richness to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new buildings we're doing for <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span> and the others out there like the Apples and whatnot, I think this is just the next evolution in the history of Silicon Valley. . .developing a unique character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Much of your previous work has been with urban buildings. How is this <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span> project different?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko: That's why this opportunity in Silicon Valley became very unique. . .we knew early on that if you have a building that has too many floors it's very hard for people to move up and down in. What makes this building unique for <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span> is that we're making this a two-story building, so you're never too far away from people and you can connect people very simply through stairs and they don't have to take elevators if they don't want to. It's very simple to walk up and down the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Why choose a polygon shape?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko: In one of the first meetings with the [<span class="companylink">Nvidia</span>] CEO [Jen-Hsun Huang], we landed on the word "iconic." I think for him it was important that this building was an icon to their culture so that a visitor or employee who came by could recognize this was <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span>'s building without having to label the building as such.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The triangle became something that resonated to them because, being a visual computing company, they're very involved in the graphics world. And the triangle to them is the basis of all the work that they did. It's that fundamental shape that really resonates with them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Some people say when a company builds a new headquarters, it's the beginning of their end. What do you think of that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ko: There's clearly people who build buildings as more of a monument or it's an ego thing, and people will build buildings for the wrong reasons, and it may be perceived as a wrong use of finances. I can only speak for <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span>, but I think they view that their greatest asset is their people, and I think they feel like this building, the purpose for building this building, is creating a greater environment for the employees and the work that they do.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeannette Neumann                And Craig Karmin   </div><div>627 words</div><div>13 March 2013</div><div>16:05</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> borrowed $2 billion from banks to invest in single-family homes it intends to rent out, according to people familiar with the loan, as the private-equity firm races to capitalize on an improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s agreement with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> and other lenders more than tripled the size of its previous loan, to $2.08 billion from $600 million, a person familiar with the deal said. Deutsche, which had arranged <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s initial accord, will remain the lead bank on the bigger loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firms such as <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span> and real-estate investment firm <span class="companylink">Waypoint Real Estate Group LLC</span> have snapped up thousands of previously foreclosed homes in recent months to rent out as part of a strategy to take advantage of the recovery of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In seeking debt financing, investors such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> can amass more properties, faster and at lower costs. Bankers say a developing loan market may also pave the way for the creation of securities backed by the rental income investors earn on the properties they own. Those deals would in turn help investors finance even more purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> loan remains the largest debt deal for an investor in formerly foreclosed homes, bankers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The size of the loan and the number of banks involved in the deal highlights Wall Street's growing comfort with the asset class, which has attracted major institutional investors in the past two or so years. The market had been dominated for decades by "mom and pop" investors who would buy up several homes to then rent out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has said it is buying single-family homes at the rate of $100 million a week, a faster pace than any other buyer. The firm now owns around 20,000 homes, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm expects to spend more than $4 billion on homes, and could seek additional loans related to fund these purchases, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> intends to end its buying binge by the end of this year. With housing prices on the rebound, particularly in Western markets like Phoenix and southern California, the firm predicts homes could soon turn expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has been relying on its $13.3 billion real-estate fund, the largest property fund ever raised, to dominate the single-family home market after other buyers got off to a faster start. Colony Capital, also a major player in the market, owns about 8,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>., OneWest Bank, Travelers Cos. unit <span class="companylink">St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co</span>., and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. also joined the loan agreement lead by Deutsche, the person familiar with the loan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is in talks to lend additional funds to up to five firms within the next two months, according to a person familiar with the bank's strategy. Those loans are expected to be hundreds of millions of dollars each, the person added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers say they are working toward a possible securitization deal as soon as this summer. Other bankers say the securitization market may develop more slowly and they say they expect a deal to be available for investors in the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers say they hope to have the deals rated by some of the major credit-rating firms. A rating would expand the amount of investors that could purchase the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloomberg News reported the <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> loan agreement's expansion earlier today.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Buyout Firm to Try Hand At Fund</span>
</div><div class="author">By Craig Karmin </div><div>846 words</div><div>13 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of real-estate funds that used piles of borrowed money to buy risky properties got crushed during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, buyout firm <span class="companylink">TPG Capital</span> is offering a new twist while mining some of the same territory with its first real-estate fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm expects to start raising money in the second half of 2013 with a target of at least $1 billion, said people familiar with TPG's plans. TPG officials acknowledged plans to raise a fund but declined to discuss specifics or timing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If TPG raises that amount, it would be the second-largest initial property fund ever, trailing only the $1.6 billion that <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> raised in 2001 with its first fund, according to data tracker Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real-estate funds that aim for double-digit returns search for office towers with high vacancies, financially strapped hotels or other distressed buildings they can buy at a discount, fix and sell within a few years. Like these funds, TPG says it is looking for troubled projects that need fresh capital or new management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in contrast with most peers, TPG has been acquiring property-related companies and large portfolios of buildings with capital staked by a TPG private-equity fund and two partners. The firm is betting this same buyout-like strategy of acquiring complete businesses -- instead of adding one property at a time -- will distinguish it from other real-estate managers on the fundraising trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We combine sound property capabilities with corporate-style investing, which TPG has significant expertise in," said Kelvin Davis, who co-founded property investor Colony Capital in 1991 and currently heads TPG's real-estate group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says buying whole companies is a more complex business that deters many other property owners and relies less on borrowed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TPG has invested more than $2 billion for 10 real-estate-related acquisitions since 2009 -- from a portfolio of Silicon Valley office buildings to a Dutch property company that collects offices and warehouses. Taylor Morrison, a home builder that a TPG partnership acquired in 2011, plans to sell shares in an initial public offering in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis declined to discuss overall return figures for real-estate investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to the New Jersey state pension fund that invested with TPG last fall, the first $1 billion of the $2 billion it has invested in real estate has appreciated about 30% as of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KKR &amp; Co</span>., another well-established private-equity firm, also began investing in real estate recently. After relying on money from the firm and other <span class="companylink">KKR</span> funds for the past two years, it is edging closer to raising its own dedicated real-estate fund, say people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TPG and <span class="companylink">KKR</span> are arriving late to the real-estate fundraising game. Rivals including <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> raised multibillion-dollar funds several years ago to buy property, which have generated large fees and boosted their firms' income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raising a large new fund also comes at a challenging time. While there are recent signs that some large institutional investors are warming again to high-risk real-estate funds, many of the biggest remain sour on them after suffering big write-downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their peak in 2008, North American closed-end real-estate funds raised $71.2 billion in capital, according to Preqin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the total was just $38.5 billion. That included a $13.3 billion fund from <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, which raised a record amount despite the tough climate. Excluding the <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> fund, last year would have had the smallest amount raised since 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making it more challenging for TPG, "there has been a steady decline in investors who will invest in first-time" real-estate funds, said Andrew Moylan, Preqin's manager of real-estate data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Worth, Texas-based private-equity firm has relied on its $19 billion global fund and arrangements with two institutional investors for the money it has invested since 2009. TPG is one of the world's biggest and most successful private-equity managers. Formerly known as <span class="companylink">Texas Pacific Group</span> and founded by David Bonderman and Jim Coulter, the 21-year-old firm has $54.5 billion of assets under management and long-term relationships with institutional investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timothy Walsh, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment, which manages about $71 billion in state pension money, said he met with TPG officials at a private-equity conference two years ago. Last fall, New Jersey agreed to invest $350 million with TPG's real-estate group. "They are not buying buildings, but operating companies, that's what appealed to us," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other big investor with TPG's real-estate program is <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span>, the property investor for Canadian pension manager <span class="companylink">Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec</span>. <span class="companylink">Ivanhoe Cambridge</span> provided more than $600 million, said William Tresham, president of global investments.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Question of 'Confidence' --- Jones Lang LaSalle Executive Discusses the State of Real Estate and Her Firm</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>1009 words</div><div>13 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been hitting record highs, and the Labor Department last week reported that employers added more jobs than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one indicator of economic activity remains in the doldrums this year: office leasing. Businesses continue to be hesitant to add space, reflecting concern about the health of the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To discuss this and other trends in commercial real estate, The Wall Street Journal spoke with Lauralee Martin, named late last year to be chief executive of the Americas division of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle Inc</span>., the world's second-largest brokerage firm. She also discussed the firm's other businesses, its competition with <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>., the largest firm, and what it is like being one of the highest-ranking women in the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are excerpts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> released year-end results at the end of January with mostly good news, including fourth-quarter revenue up 9% from last year. But results for other firms have been mixed? What's going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin: The overall market -- not <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> -- still reflects the uncertainty going on in the government, which means it's very difficult for business to make longer-term, forward looking decisions. Leasing was down 30% in the fourth quarter [overall], but we actually ended up being up 9%. We're going against the broader market. We're definitely performing well in a market that is trying to improve, but has confidence issues getting back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: So it sounds like you think next year could be pretty weak, as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin: <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> doesn't give guidance, but we've given what we think market trends are going to do overall, and we think they're going to continue to reflect continued hesitance. But I think we could have a much stronger second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Do you have your eye on replacing CBRE as the No. 1 firm? How do you plan to accomplish that?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin: Well, first of all, we are No. 1 in many, many markets. If you just take size, yeah, they're No. 1. But if you then go where real estate is done, which is in markets and in certain services, there's many places where we're No. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me put it this way: 85% of the leases this year went to Class A property. Now where is Class A property? It's in big cities, generally metropolitan areas and so forth. If we're winning the most of those, that's a nice place to be. The way you're going to get big is you're doing small leases in small towns, and that isn't necessarily going to work for our shareholders because we can't do that as effectively or profitably as would be our choice to do. No. 1 by size isn't necessarily a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Investment sales is one place where CBRE is much bigger than you. Do you want to get more into that business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin: Well we are. We've significantly increased our business in that area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually, if you go outside the U.S., we would have a leadership position. If you go to Asia, we believe we're the leaders. There's a couple of markets where they would be considered a leader, but if you went broadly across Asia we would be. Same thing in Europe now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But you are absolutely right, in the United States, they have a dominant position. Now we've moved ourselves from where in most markets we wouldn't even be in the top five, where today in some of the markets and some of the product types, we actually have moved up into the top three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We just announced an acquisition [in Dallas] -- we were not even in the multifamily business three years ago in the United States. We now have 75 people that are brokering into the multifamily space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: You've been at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> for 11 years and had more of a global perspective in your previous role as chief operating officer and chief financial officer. What do you see yourself as wanting to change now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin: The opportunity that I had in my global job was I really did see how all of our world connected. That's a different perspective that can bring another level of energy into our growth and the things we go after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've been involved in all of the acquisitions that <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> has done around the world, so about 50 acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So again: seeing how to think about selecting them and optimizing them and bringing them forward in that consolidation our industry is in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Real-estate brokerage traditionally has been a male-dominated business. How do you think you could help other women at JLL succeed as you have?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin: I will have to say that I haven't personally spent a lot of time thinking about gender, and maybe that is why I have done well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have never made gender an issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have brought results and impact and capabilities into the jobs that I have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What I coach women on is that there are some characteristics that are very helpful in a more male-dominated industry. I definitely approach things with enough of a sense of humor that the seriousness of it doesn't outweigh the fact that you can have a sense of humor. It's helpful to approach things as a team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As women, we're very complete. We want it to be absolutely perfect, and that's important, but that doesn't mean that has to be done as an individual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can be a very powerful contributor to a team.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Community Preservation Corp</span>., which for decades was one of the city's leading affordable-housing lenders, was on the brink of irrelevance a year ago after it made a number of bad bets on the condo boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the 38-year-old nonprofit lender has received a $250 million infusion of capital from <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., which promises to revive the organization and allow it to refocus on its core mission rehabilitating affordable housing in lower-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CPC plans to use the new funds for the construction and renovation of as many as 6,000 apartment units. It closed on its first deal under the new program -- a $1.59 million loan, which along with $2.4 million provided by the city, will help rehabilitate two distressed Bronx buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan will allow Workforce Housing Advisors, which acquired the 10-unit buildings at 539-541 E. 147th St. in October 2011, to perform major improvements to, including installing a new roof, windows, plumbing, electrical systems and heating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rockefeller led the founding of the nonprofit in 1974, with investments by major banks, including what is now Citi, which withdrew its support in 2007. Over the years CPC was involved the creation or preservation of about 145,000 units of primarily affordable rental housing, and considered a key player in the revitalization of many of the city's neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, while CPC's focus on the small, four-story walk-ups and six-story elevator buildings might seem modest, experts said the nonprofit is vital to the health of many neighborhoods of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fate of a neighborhood resides in the fate of those buildings," said Marc Jahr, president of the city <span class="companylink">Housing Development Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But around 2003, when the condo market began heating up, CPC ventured away from that core mission into financing and developing new condo projects. In part, CPC officials said they were forced to diversify away from rental housing because the market was flooded with large banks willing to cut loans even for small projects, making it difficult for traditional affordable-housing lenders to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most prominently, CPC Resources Inc., a for-profit development arm, led the purchase of the 11-acre Domino Sugar site in Brooklyn in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After guiding the project through a bruising public approval process, CPC defaulted on a $125 million loan on the project and sold it to Two Trees Management Co. for $185 million -- making a profit on the sale despite the troubled history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of CPC's investments didn't fare so well. When the recession hit in 2008, CPC had more than $900 million in exposure to the collapsing condo market. CPC has spent much of the last five years regrouping from those losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I came to CPC the company was experiencing a period of significant stress because of the activity and impact of the downturn, said Rafael Cestero, who took over as CPC's chief executive in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cestero said he spent much of his first year reducing the amount of distressed debt on the company's balance sheet to less than $151 million from $255 million when he started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment by Citi marks another turning point. Until recently, CPC had just $70 million of capital to lend, which means the $250 million investment nearly quadruples its lending capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It allows us to make a turn from being focused on workouts to providing capital for affordable housing in New York," Mr. Cestero said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials and affordable-housing developers said CPC's diminished role as a lender to smaller building owners has left a void, especially as financing has become even more difficult to get since the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also said CPC's re-entry into the space marks a broader shift for the market -- away from the risky loans that helped plunge dozens of smaller apartment buildings into financial and physical distress, toward the more traditionally grass-roots model of funding affordable housing that CPC helped pioneer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our sense is that the market is leaving behind some of the extremes of terrible lending that led directly to the economic crisis and that more responsible lending is becoming more the norm. CPC plays an important role in that space," said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director at the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A half-built medical complex in San Leandro, Calif., is on the leading edge of an emerging workplace-technology boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of working from the standard paper blueprints, supervisors on the construction site tote iPads loaded with digitized blueprints they can annotate with finger swipe. Each time the architect or building owner changes a paint color or the location of a wall in the plans, the information arrives electronically from the offices of Rudolph &amp; Sletten, the contractor based in Redwood City, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PlanGrid, the startup behind the digital-blueprint software, will receive roughly $7,000 from the builder over the two-year building project. Rudolph &amp; Sletten paid for its own <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. iPads, fewer than a dozen in all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The digitized documents partly replace hundreds of pages of construction blueprints that need to be updated so often that student interns handle the monotonous work. Rudolph &amp; Sletten said the blueprints tab is roughly $15,000 to $20,000 for large building projects like this one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The benefit of [digital-blueprint technology] has been so apparent," said Rebeca Ayala, a Rudolph &amp; Sletten senior engineer, because the easily updated software means they don't have to worry about workers consulting an out-of-date blueprint, among other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mobile revolution -- which has changed life in so many ways, from getting driving directions to sharing photos -- is seeping into corporate technology. Nearly half of the respondents in a recent <span class="companylink">Forrester Research Inc</span>. survey said they use a smartphone at least once a week for work, and 21% said they use a tablet for work at least weekly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of this use so far is for emailing or as a mobile supplement for existing workplace tasks, like digital flight manuals for airplane pilots on iPads or checking in guests at hotels. But now, mobile technology is becoming affordable for a broader base of companies, and it is spreading from ancillary functions to areas ingrained in employees' workdays, such as marketing materials for pharmaceutical reps, customer account software for service technicians and apps for testing the quality of cow's milk for farmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just like we had a wave of entrepreneurs developing apps for smartphones for consumers, now we're seeing a wave of companies doing the same for enterprises," said Matt Murphy, a venture capitalist at <span class="companylink">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, mobile-work services have made the most inroads in industries with a lot of roaming workers who aren't often at their desks, such as pharmaceutical sales reps, service technicians and contractors, said investors and mobile-company executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some companies are opting for mobile-centric technologies to replace their own traditional computer software. Beverage-bottling company <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc</span>. tapped mobile service <span class="companylink">ServiceMax Inc</span>. last year to streamline the workdays of its technicians, who service restaurant soda fountains and fix vending machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previously, after a technician visited a customer's location, he would go back to his car, transfer information from paper notes into a database on his laptop and send it through <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span>'s 12-year-old central-software system. Many spent an extra half hour at the end of each day polishing their paperwork, said Easwaran Krishnamurthy, director of information-technology development for the Atlanta company, which is independent from <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, about 100 CCE employees started using ServiceMax apps on iPhones to dispatch technicians to a day's worth of service calls, give them detailed customer information at their fingertips, automatically update rosters of service parts stored in their vans and transfer information to the billing department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krishnamurthy said administration time for service technicians was cut by a third, and the employees were freed up to service other companies' equipment in addition to CCE's own. CCE declined to disclose how much it is paying, but ServiceMax says its subscription fee is roughly $1,000 per person each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ryan Sutton-Gee, PlanGrid's co-founder and chief executive, said the construction business for years had halting efforts to embrace specialized software and computing devices, like hand-held computers or rugged laptops, which were often complicated to use and expensive for all but the largest businesses. He said his company couldn't have survived in those days, but tech adoption is now on a rapid upswing thanks to ubiquitous smartphones and tablets, along with easily accessed cloud software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Rusin, chief financial officer of McKinley Equipment, doesn't need to be convinced about mobile workplace software. Employees at the 65-year-old company in Irvine, Calif., which repairs warehouse equipment like overhead doors and industrial fans, are using ServiceMax to keep records of customer visits, including all the model numbers, parts and service history of the equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rusin said the software helps his workers be more efficient and he has opened a new line of business offering service contracts rather than just repairs by the hour. Mr. Rusin said he hired three additional people to work on the new large contract that will increase service-department revenue by 38%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though we're spending more money, we're growing our business," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel </div><div>913 words</div><div>12 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seemed like a good idea back in what turned out to be the waning days of the condominium craze of the 1980s: Turn a massive 10-story former printing building on Hudson Street with Italian Renaissance details and 15-foot ceilings into 184 duplex loft condominiums with a large health club and a pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dream faded at Printing House -- along with dozens of other 1980s condominiums in New York -- as the real-estate market entered a long slump. Much of the building, already a rental, has been rented out since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many condo projects stalled during the latest real-estate crash are being resuscitated and put back up for sale in the past year or so. Now, Printing House, a West Village condo conversion first launched more than a quarter of century ago, is also getting a new life -- and a new look.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining 104 sponsor apartments are being gutted, combined and put back on the market as 60 larger apartments -- with 21st-century prices and designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark one-bedroom lofts have been reconfigured with glass walls, thin metal railings and open stairs to bring in more light to the upper level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the printing era, windows were partitioning by thick horizontal metal bands. Now these have been combined into 9-foot-high, mullioned windows, many with views across Hudson Street to a city playground. A row of townhouses is planned on a landscaped mews in the back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1980s, there has been a flourishing market among investors in blocks of unsold condo units from that era, but only few have had large scale rebirths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Morgan Court, a 32-story sliver tower on Madison Avenue built in 1985, sales stalled to the point that the developer allowed it to be used as the backdrop for a dark 1993 thriller movie, "Sliver" starring Sharon Stone, in which a body flies off a balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were relaunched in the 40-unit Morgan Court building in 2007 after renovations. Reba Miller, a broker at CORE who represents the Morgan Court developer, said that nine of 22 sponsor-owned condos have been sold since. Other apartments are being put on the market as they become vacant, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Printing House, the lobby was redesigned to evoke the building's past in the printing industry. The original 1911 vaulted tile ceiling is intact but there is now a doorman's desk with a large steel panel on which the Gettysburg Address has been laser-cut in an abstract font, evoking the age of metal type. Steel panels attached to the mailboxes have the Declaration of Independence, according to the architect, Andrew Kotchen of workshop/apd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He called the redesign "rustic modernism."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How far the building has come can be seen in changing prices. Back in 1975, the original sponsors, Barnet Liberman and Winthrop Chamberlin, paid $476,000 for the entire building, at a time it was a half vacant printing building, Mr. Liberman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, the sponsors sold two 785-square-foot, one-bedroom apartments, that together cost close to the price of the building. Now prices on renovated apartments will range between $1.5 million for one-bedrooms and more than $7 million for larger condos, according to Tricia Cole, managing director of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liberman said that he and his partner sold off apartments from time to time over the years, but decided to put the rest of the building on the market a few years ago, at a time when he was nearing retirement age and needed to raise capital some of his other investments, in Florida, Texas and Las Vegas, that did not do as well as Printing House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They sold most of their interest in the unsold apartments last year for $67.6 million to a group of investors -- Myles Horn, <span class="companylink">Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co</span>. and Belvedere Capital Real Estate Partners. They still retained an ownership share as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closing was delayed for many months because of a lawsuit from a losing bidder in the deal. Now it is coming on the market at a time when there is very little inventory, and the market is stronger than it was a year ago, Mr. Horn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kotchen redesigned the hallways, ripping out low ceilings, and replacing them with multilevel spaces soaring to more than 15-feet high in places. Still sales in the buildings have a few challenges: On some floors, head clearance is only about 6 1/2 feet from the floor of the loft space to the concrete beams above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building also has a few unusual features. It has large solar-heating panels on the roof installed decades ago, before the current wave of green building, but the system is no longer in service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also has a large gym on the ground floor that was once a popular center for squash in Manhattan, and a rooftop pool workout space. A few years ago Equinox took over the space, renovated it and replaced the squash courts with exercise equipment. A one-year membership is included with purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liberman and Mr. Chamberlin both live in Printing House in apartments that they have long owned. In 1986, they turned them into penthouses, by expanding into the roof and adding a level.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Craig Karmin </div><div>963 words</div><div>8 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group led by one of China's leading developers is in advanced discussions to buy a 40% stake in the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> building in Manhattan, a deal that would rank as one of the largest purchases of a single U.S. property by a Chinese investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If sold at the price under discussion, the deal led by the family of Zhang Xin, chief executive of office landlord <span class="companylink">Soho China Ltd</span>., would value the trophy building at about $3.4 billion including debt, according to real-estate executives with knowledge of the talks. That would make it by far the most valuable building in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, Chinese investment in U.S. real estate has been limited, although the country increasingly has been buying properties in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang declined to comment on the talks, which could still break down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers, a group of Middle Eastern sovereign-wealth funds, joined landlord <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>. to buy the 1.8 million-square-foot building in 2008 for $2.8 billion. The group hired <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. to market the 40% stake last year, hoping to cash in on the sharp rise in value of top-quality property in large U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is controlled by <span class="companylink">Boston Properties</span>, which isn't selling its 60% stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on the southeast corner of Central Park, the GM building houses such tenants as <span class="companylink">Estee Lauder Cos</span>. and the law firm <span class="companylink">Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges</span>, and its office rents are among the highest in Manhattan. The building's retail attractions -- <span class="companylink">FAO Schwarz</span> and an <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. store on the plaza -- also have made it a tourist attraction. <span class="companylink">General Motors Co</span>. built the tower in 1968 for corporate offices and a show room. It later sold the building but maintained a sizeable presence as a tenant for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's hands down the best real estate in the U.S.," said Michael Knott, a real-estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yield-starved investors have been bidding up top U.S. properties even though rents have generally been stagnant. National commercial property prices are now within 1% of their 2007 peak levels, according to Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investment in U.S. real estate has been controversial over the years, especially when high-profile properties have been purchased. For example, Japanese investors sparked fears that national icons were being lost when they went on a buying spree starting in the late 1980s, snapping up properties like Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors had avoided this type of scrutiny in the U.S. partly because they haven't been buying much. Property purchases by Chinese buyers have been adding up to less than $1 billion a year, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics LLC</span>, not including investments with private equity funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese investors also have avoided the spotlight by investing in U.S. real estate through private-equity funds. For example, the government-run <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., has invested with big real-estate fund managers such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Asset Management Inc</span>., which in turn have purchased U.S. property, including a big stake in mall giant <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang has been an exception to that. In 2011, her family bought a 49% stake in Park Avenue Plaza, a 1.2 million-square-foot Manhattan office tower for nearly $600 million, executives familiar with the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Ms. Zhang has been looking for more. She also was part of a group that put in an ultimately successful bid late last year on <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>.'s U.S. headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue, known as the Chippendale building, which sold for $1.1 billion after a hotly contested bidding process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terms of the GM building deal under discussion couldn't be learned, but the tower currently has about $1.6 billion in debt held by third parties, as well as another $450 million in debt held by the existing owners. That suggests Ms. Zhang's group would pay an amount well over $500 million or more, depending on any changes to the debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group that is trying to sell its stake includes the sovereign-wealth funds of Kuwait and Qatar -- both of which invested through a <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. fund -- and an investor affiliated with the ruling family of Dubai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zhang and her husband, Pan Shiyi, built China Soho to become the largest developer of top office properties in Beijing and Shanghai. She is negotiating to buy the GM building stake as an individual and China Soho isn't involved in the talks, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the <span class="companylink">China Insurance Regulatory Commission</span> relaxed the rules for some big insurers to invest in certain types of property in major cities. But U.S. real-estate investors eager for Chinese clients say the process is just beginning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa Herrington, a 35-year-old artist who lives in Venice, Calif., recently moved into a 2,000-square-foot, three-story loft-style home after a divorce. Her designer's directive: "to reflect 100% Melissa."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loft is an open, sunny space that includes a large second-floor studio where she paints and a third-floor master suite. Designer Trina Boyd created a space where Ms. Herrington's artwork could take center stage. "This loft is what I would consider all mine, my style and everything I wanted to put into it," Ms. Herrington says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury homes designed for one -- or bachelor and bachelorette pads, as they're often called -- may be the hottest thing in the singles scene. Architects, builders and interior designers say they're increasingly asked to create wide-open spaces with custom amenities that pack a "wow" factor for entertaining friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just in the last year, I've seen prices paid for tricked-out bachelor pads in the Hollywood Hills go up by 20%," says Josh Altman, a luxury broker based in Los Angeles. Last year, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss -- of <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> fame -- paid $18 million for an 8,000-square-foot house, more than $2,000 per a square foot. "Those kinds of homes are commanding some of the highest prices for real estate in California," Mr. Altman adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating spaces for singles can turn into the ultimate in design fantasy fulfillment, with just one person's tastes and visions driving the project. "The word selfish comes up again and again," says Nils Wager, an entrepreneur who sold a 4,000-square-foot bachelor pad he built in the Hollywood Hills to actor Matthew Perry a year and a half ago for $8.5 million. "You don't have to think about children, or a partner, or anything really, except what you want."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michaelle Fastlicht, a digital-media entrepreneur in Los Angeles, is just finishing a roughly $750,000 renovation of a 4,400-square-foot midcentury-modern home she bought for $2.5 million last year. She knocked down several walls to create a 2,000-square-foot "great room," turning the kitchen area, living room and dining room into one space, with wood-beam ceilings. She's building a home office in one corner of it. "I didn't need more private space," says Ms. Fastlicht, 40, who runs her own company and this spring plans to launch an app that curates digital content for a Hispanic audience. "I really wanted a space where I could integrate my social life and my work in a seamless experience," she says. "You're cooking one minute and looking up a hilarious foodie video on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> the next."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other must-have features in singleton spaces: a large steam shower, a media room with a big-screen television, and sound speakers in every room -- "even in obscure places, like the broom closet," says designer Lori Dennis, who has worked on several places for singles in Los Angeles and Lake Tahoe in recent years. "Speakers are the male equivalent of shoes for women -- men can't get enough of them." Gyms and massage rooms are also popular amenities, says builder John Finton, who has done homes for Jennifer Lopez and Dustin Hoffman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some single clients, left to their own devices, will request far more unusual amenities, from flight simulators to basement nightclubs and bars. James Stanley, a New York-based designer, says he recently did a pop-art-themed penthouse for a wealthy bachelor in Manhattan that has a flame-red living room with foosball and pool tables and a "Star Wars"-themed bedroom room. "I've done a few outrageous places in the city for divorced fathers and bachelors, and it's a fun thing to do because it's like a second childhood," he says. "He went hog wild."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many designers counsel restraint. "You don't want to make it a caricature," says New York-based interior designer Vicente Wolf. "It has to be a home, it has to be inviting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create an inviting space for Doug Davis, a 40-year-old entertainment and sports lawyer and the son of music mogul Clive Davis, Mr. Wolf created a plush, wraparound sofa for the living room and upholstered a wall in the bedroom with mohair to give it a cozier feel. Overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan's Flatiron neighborhood, the apartment also has a large sliding door to open up the den/media room for entertaining and capture the courtyard view. Its decor ranges from a mix of antique pieces, like a 1930s metal cash vault from a Parisian bank, to a contemporary painting by Shepard Fairey, the artist best known for his Obama "Hope" posters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I hate the term 'bachelor pad,'" says Mr. Davis, who currently has a girlfriend. "I wanted a place where [guests] were comfortable that wasn't too stuffy, and to reflect the taste I have for art and antiques."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased focus on single living comes as the number of Americans living alone has increased sharply, from four million, or 9% of households, in 1950 to 33 million, or 28% of households, in 2011, according Eric Klinenberg, a <span class="companylink">New York University</span> sociology professor and author of "Going Solo." Today, more people in the U.S. live alone than at any other time in history -- a trend especially prevalent in big cities: Between a third and half of households in major American cities contain a single person. In Manhattan and Washington, D.C., roughly half of all households are occupied by just one person. Demand is also coming from abroad, with an influx of foreign buyers looking for single-person pads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are variations on single living that can be communal. Ryan and Adam Goldston, 25-year-old identical twins, two years ago purchased nearly identical condos for $1.598 million each on the same floor of the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> Residences at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles. The apartments, mirror images of each other, span 2,000 square feet and have two bedrooms each. The twins, who are former college football and basketball players and now run a shoe company together, say they bought identical apartments because they wanted to achieve similar goals. "We both wanted to create getaways," says Ryan Goldston. "But being close to each other really helps our company, since we often work until the middle of night."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the brothers say they wanted to be close, they also wanted each of their apartments reflect their personalities. To differentiate the two bachelor pads, the twins adopted separate design schemes; Ryan Goldston decorated his apartment in a style he calls "Ralph Lauren-esque," covering his couch and chairs with old suit fabric and buying white furniture to create an airy, light feel. Adam Goldston, by contrast, has a darker color scheme in his apartment, with a large purple leather couch as the centerpiece to his living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Alexander, an event designer who lives in Manhattan, hired architect Paul Masi to design his Southampton, N.Y., home. The 3,500-square-foot, three-bedroom space overlooking a pond was designed as both a private retreat for the frequent traveler and a place to host numerous guests on summer weekends. The exterior of the home features distressed cedar screening, and there are lower and upper deck areas for entertaining. Though Mr. Alexander insisted he didn't need a bathtub in house (he prefers showers), Mr. Masi said he should include one "for resale value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although bachelor-pad-type homes don't attract families among potential buyers, their resale value continues to be very robust, brokers say. Mr. Altman, the Los Angeles broker, says one of his clients paid $4.5 million in 2010 for a 5,000-square-foot Los Angeles home with walls of glass, a theater, and an infinity pool; he sold it for $5.67 million two years later. Last year, actor-director-producer Tyler Perry sold his 8,751-square-foot home above Sunset Boulevard for $11.25 million. He paid $9.6 million in 2006 for the property, which has a glass-floor catwalk that serves as the ceiling of the wine cellar, a nightclub with a bar and disco ball, a gym, a sauna, four bedrooms and a billiards room that overlooks a pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers today are responding to the increased demand for single-living "with amenities to make the building more social and fun," adds Mr. Klinenberg, the NYU professor. He says many developers are using gyms, dog-walking services and even larger mailrooms to create a more social environment to lure single people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Centurion, a New York condo designed by I.M. Pei, hired interior designer Mr. Stanley to come up with plans for a third-floor duplex apartment attached to a commercial space on the market for $5.95 million. Mr. Stanley says he created two separate plans envisioning it for either a single female or male, including a two-story pool with aquarium cutouts looking into the ground-floor space, which could be a salon for a woman or a game room or billiard area for a male.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many singles, however, it's only a matter of time before somebody else moves in. In 2010, Nicole Hollis, a San Francisco interior designer, designed a two-bedroom apartment for a young emergency-room doctor, Travis Heining, with cheeky nods to bachelor-pad tropes -- including hiring an artist to decoupage a powder room with vintage Playboy magazine covers from the '60s and '70s. In 2011, Mr. Heining, 39, got married, and he now shares the apartment with his wife, who wants to redesign the guest bathroom with the Playboy walls. "She thinks it doesn't scream 'married couple,'" he says. "I think it's great, but I understand."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>1006 words</div><div>7 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)</div><div>WSJE</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of American homes that end up in foreclosure has started to decline, a welcome development that partly reflects an improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a look at data that tracks distressed home sales reveals another reason why foreclosures are becoming less prevalent: More homeowners are turning to so-called short sales -- where they sell their homes for less than what they owe in mortgage debt and the bank typically eats the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, short sales were rare. Now they are becoming increasingly common in part because lenders, homeowners and real-estate agents have become more experienced at marketing and pricing the properties, and because short sales are considered a more efficient way than foreclosure to sell underwater properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift is helping the housing market pare the backlog of distressed mortgages while cutting the amount of time vacant homes sit empty. That has helped keep home prices firm at a time when the real-estate industry is still healing from its multiyear slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cesar Rivera is one beneficiary of the shift. Mr. Rivera paid about $290,000 for a four-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot house in Phoenix in 2003. After he was laid off in 2008 and got divorced, it became difficult to make the nearly $2,000 monthly mortgage payment. He stopped paying in 2009 and abandoned the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, a real-estate agent helped arrange a short sale for about $220,000. Waiting for foreclosure felt like "I was frozen in time," said the 41-year-old Mr. Rivera, who now rents in the Phoenix area. The short sale was "a huge ton of bricks off my back. I'm just relieved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures accounted for 11.5% of total home sales in October, down from 17.3% in October 2011 and close to 30% during the depths of the recession, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> , a real-estate research firm that tracks foreclosure and home-sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the same period, short sales have climbed to 10.4% from 8.1%. There also has been an increase in other foreclosure alternatives, such as a deed in lieu of foreclosure -- where an owner gives up a home and the bank agrees to forgive the mortgage debt -- though the numbers are so small that <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says they can't be measured precisely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales also generally fetch more than foreclosures. In December, short sales cost 24% less than a comparable house that wasn't in financial distress, whereas foreclosures had a 64% discount, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From an economic perspective, short sales leave everyone better off: Banks and investors see narrower losses, homeowners incur less damage to their credit while their neighbors' homes are less likely to be dragged down in value because of the typically higher sale prices and reduced vacancy times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Short sales change hands much more quickly," said Sam Khater, senior economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> . "That's a good thing for the economy and society."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luis Solis, the Phoenix real-estate agent who helped Mr. Rivera with his sale, notes that short-sale homes are usually in better shape than foreclosures because they generally sit vacant for a few days or weeks versus several months or longer for foreclosures. That leaves less time for a home to fall into disrepair and reduces the vandalism threat. "The owner is still living there -- it's still their home and they usually take care of it right up to the point of sale," said Mr. Solis, who adds that over the past year his business has shifted focus from marketing foreclosures to marketing short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds that short sales are particularly popular with investors who are buying distressed homes to fix up and rent out. They are not only in better condition, but typically there also is less investor competition than there is for foreclosures that are sold at auction. "There is so little inventory right now that when a foreclosure pops up it gets past the point where there's a margin to buy and resell," he said. "If you do a short sale you already have a contract that's approved by the bank, so you're not really going against other buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks also have become more adept at processing short sales quickly. Bart Vincent, national short-sales manager for a unit of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span> ., says over the past few years his bank has reduced the amount of seller documentation needed to complete a short sale. It also built a software system that allows real-estate agents to quickly figure out what documents a seller needs and, based on that, about how long it should take to close the deal. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> says it now takes 10 days to make a decision on 80% of its short-sale requests, compared with around 15 days a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a five-year decline, home prices are finally moving upward. U.S. home prices rose 6.8% in December from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year gain since 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> /Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released last week. The rise has been fueled by low interest rates and a flurry of investor activity that has drastically reduced the number of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that progress, there are still millions of homeowners who are in some form of pre-foreclosure distress -- a "shadow inventory" that could hit the market and spell trouble for the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span>, estimates the market needs to absorb about three million homes before the shadow inventory is reduced to its level before the housing bust. She calls them "the pig in the python." While there is still a long way to go, short sales help speed up the process, she says. "At least you're getting some of the pig moving."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to real-estate deals, the rich aren't that much different than everyone else: Every dollar counts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data on real-estate closings in Manhattan show that a record number of sales of luxury properties were completed in December, just before Washington lawmakers increased the federal capital-gains tax rates. The surge of luxury closings was more than 60% above the peak month for such high-value deals during the real-estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impulse to minimize taxes is as strong as it's ever been," said Robert Willens, an accountant and expert on tax policy and its impact on corporate transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impetus of the tax-law changes and the year-end rush by sellers, lawyers and brokers to complete transactions before the end of 2012 were well chronicled, both before and after the start of the new year. But only now that nearly all of December's transaction records have trickled in has the magnitude of the deal rush become clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the end of February, December deals for 156 Manhattan apartments priced at $4 million or more were recorded, the highest total for such transactions in a single month. The best single month for such deals during the frothy real-estate boom was recorded in June 2007, when 95 co-ops, condominiums and townhouses closed for $4 million and up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less-affluent buyers have shown a similar tendency to focus on the bottom line here and across the country. The best single month since 2006 for sales below $800,000 in Manhattan was June 2010, when federal home-buyer tax credits of up to $8,000 were scheduled to expire. There were 871 such sales in June 2010, followed by 678 sales last December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, December ranked as the third highest month for residential sales in Manhattan since 2007. Typically about 97% of deed and transfer documents are filed within 60 days of the end of each month, an analysis of closing records shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward the end of last year, owners in Manhattan cut prices in an effort to make deals to qualify for lower tax bills, brokers say. Some owners were armed with spreadsheets, showing how much they could save in taxes at each price point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sellers who rushed to lock in tax savings at the same time may now be worse off, compared with other sellers who waited. The tax-related selling last year burned through much of the listing inventory, bringing it to its lowest levels in many years. Now brokers say prices are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital-gains taxes rose by 8.8 percentage points for many affluent sellers in 2013, including an increase to 20% from 15% in the capital-gains rates and a new 3.8% Medicare tax on capital gains, including real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was totally crazy," said Lisa Simonsen, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, who sold an apartment she owned in a prewar building on East 72nd Street for $1.25 million on the day after Christmas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She that she and her clients were caught up in a "number crunching exercise" wondering whether tax rates would go up and by how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She listed the two-bedroom apartment that she had bought years ago at an asking price of nearly $1.6 million last year. She eventually cut the asking price to $1.295 million and then made a deal for 3.6% less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now she said the market is "on fire." "I am not sure I gave myself the right advice," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Willens said that many taxpayers expected even larger tax-rate increases this year, "leading to the question of whether these sellers shortchanged themselves by rushing to sell their properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said December ended with the lowest number of listings -- 4,739 co-ops and condos -- that he has recorded in the 12 years he has been tracking the inventory figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that the 2012 tax deadline brought so many sellers and buyers into the market that the activity carried over into January and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Who said that tax policy doesn't influence real-estate purchase behavior," he said. "We clearly saw that in 2012, but what was surprising was the carry-over into 2013."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, an economist at brokers Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, said with the Manhattan market now "strong and getting stronger," the large number of sales in 2012 will have only a temporary effect on sales volume this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the new figures show that tax policy affects behavior of players at many different segments of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the lower end there is a perception that tax policy will only affect higher-income people," he said, "and that is clearly not the case."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a five-year decline, home prices are finally moving upward. U.S. home prices rose 6.8% in December from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year gain since 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> /Case-Shiller 20-city home price index released last week. The rise has been fueled by low interest rates and a flurry of investor activity that has drastically reduced the number of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that progress, there are still millions of homeowners who are in some form of pre-foreclosure distress—a "shadow inventory" that could hit the market and spell trouble for the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ivy Zelman, chief executive of research firm <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span>, estimates the market needs to absorb about three million homes before the shadow inventory is reduced to its level before the housing bust. She calls them "the pig in the python." While there is still a long way to go, short sales help speed up the process, she says. "At least you're getting some of the pig moving."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anita Likus </div><div>834 words</div><div>6 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraged by rising prices, London housing developers are cranking up production, particularly on sites along the Thames River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, they are finding plenty of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ballymore Group says it has sold 90% of the 514 apartments that so far have been put on the market at its GBP 10 billion ($15.11 billion) Embassy Gardens development along the river in southwest London. The project eventually will include 2,000 homes, with the U.S. Embassy in the middle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, the Battersea power station stood empty for 30 years. But a consortium of Malaysian investors -- SP Setia, <span class="companylink">Sime Darby</span> and the <span class="companylink">Employees Provident Fund</span> -- took over the site last year and plan to convert it into a residential development. The Battersea Power Station Development Co. says buyers put down payments on 75% of the 850 flats in the first week of sales early this year. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London's development pipeline is at its strongest since the residential boom of 2006 and 2007, just before the financial crisis hit, says real-estate company <span class="companylink">Drivers Jonas Deloitte</span>. Overall, 44 new projects, each with more than 50 units, were started in the second half of 2012, and should eventually create almost 5,500 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is an acute shortage of homes in London," says Mark Dickinson, managing director of property group Lend Lease, which is building 2,500 high-end apartments as part of the GBP 1.5 billion regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle, a gritty area just south of the river in central London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the U.K. housing market struggled since the 2008 financial crisis, London house prices have been resilient. <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas Real Estate</span> expects London home prices to rise 41% by 2016, more than any other part of the U.K. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers have long been a key part of the London housing market and are expected to remain so. Some see it as a safe haven for their money, away from the Middle East or the euro zone. Others are attracted by the recent weakness of the British pound, and yet others buy when their children go to school in the U.K. capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from 52 countries outside the U.K. spent GBP 2.2 billion on new homes in Central London property in 2012, up from GBP 1.8 billion in 2011, according to agents Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The One Hyde Park development, sandwiched between one of London's most famous parks and the upmarket Knightsbridge neighborhood, has attracted buyers from more than 25 nationalities, said a spokeswoman for CPC Group, its developer. A Kazakhstan buyer spent GBP 25 million on a four-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk, some analysts say, is that the rush of properties expected to hit the market in the next few years could give potential buyers plenty of choices among properties with similar amenities, such as designer furnishings, swimming pools, gyms and concierge reception areas, thereby putting some pressure on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, property specialist Savills estimates that 14,646 units are being built or planned near the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts are encouraging developers to move fast. "We favor quick delivery schedules, as more supply is being built in reaction to this demand [from overseas investors for new build units], and international capital flows can be fickle," says analyst Harm Meijer, an analyst at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Battersea Power Station development, the 850 units in the first phase of development are being offered from between GBP 338,000 for a studio to GBP 894,000 for a three-bed flat to penthouses that start at GBP 6 million. The first tenants are expected to move in in 2015, followed soon after by the embassy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, developers aim to build 3,400 units over six phases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joint-venture developers <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Qatari Diar</span> plan to develop the Shell Centre, with 790 units of housing as well as retail, offices and cafes and restaurants. But <span class="companylink">Canary Wharf Group</span>'s managing director John Pagano isn't worried about competition. "The best place to build is right next to transport hubs," he says. "The South Bank developments largely complement each other and will only enhance the attractiveness of the area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another developer, CPC Group, plans to redevelop the area around Sugar Quay, a riverbank site near Tower Bridge. CPC is working with architects Foster + Partners on the project, which is envisioned to have 165 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asset manager <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span> is also planning to redevelop a riverside area opposite London's traditional financial district, known as the City of London, which should deliver 492 new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are already reacting to the competition. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span>'s Mr. Meijer notes that most of the listed companies he looks at as part of his research "are mostly avoiding the competition that is unfolding in riverside locations."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>913 words</div><div>6 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the barren symbol of a lost age, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has been at the center of the city's efforts to revive its dying manufacturing sector. Now, the 10-year undertaking has reached a milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp. plans to announce Wednesday that it will begin renovating the site's largest structure, Building 77. With 1 million square feet of room, it contains about a quarter of the yard's usable space and is the last large building to be developed on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project already has landed an anchor tenant: a Brooklyn-based developer and entrepreneur who is taking over 240,000 square feet for his own medical lab and to rent to other companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Building 77 represents a gamble that the Navy Yard can build on past, more modest successes and create a bustling hub of biomedical, technology and small manufacturing companies to rival other thriving districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development corporation plans to spent $60 million to renovate the building, money raised through the federal EB-5 program, which grants visas to foreign investors in local development projects, and state and federal tax credits. It is the corporation's largest investment in a single project to date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is part of an upswing in activity planned at the Navy Yard in the next few years, as 1.8 million square feet of space -- including a green manufacturing center -- is set to be redeveloped. Still empty: a few spaces scattered throughout the site and a Civil War-era hospital that developers envision as a media campus. There are also 20 undeveloped acres that the corporation hopes will attract developers who want to build new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're really peaking right now," said Andrew Kimball, the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp.'s president and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study by the Pratt Center for Community Development found the Navy Yard gave a $2 billion boost to the local economy in 2011 and sustains 10,000 jobs, compared with 10 years ago when it contributed $516 million and supported 2,700 jobs. "It has become this incredible economic engine," said Adam Friedman, director of the center and a member of the Navy Yard's board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the site has a fraction of the 70,000 workers it employed during its heyday as a shipyard in World War II. It is not likely to recapture that moment: The city's diminished manufacturing sector is now dominated by small companies creating niche products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renovating Building 77, a 16-story former ammunition depot that has been largely unused for 50 years, is a daunting task. The building has windows only on the top floors and walls that are more than 2-feet thick. The interior is scattered with debris and gives off the odor of decades of decay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the upper floors also have clear potential to attract Brooklyn's growing technology sector with huge floor plates and views on four sides of Manhattan, Williamsburg and Downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helped convince developer Jack Basch to move his own Shiel Medical Laboratory from another building on the site into Building 77, where he expects to add another 300 to 400 jobs to his current 600-member payroll. He is spending $20 million and taking on 180,000 additional square feet to lease to other companies in his field. Mr. Basch moved the lab to the Navy Yard from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be no problem because the Navy Yard is one of the hottest areas," Mr. Basch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the plan is successful, it will be an impressive turnaround for the Navy Yard, a center of shipbuilding since the early 19th Century that declined into a windswept home of a police tow pound and warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg administration spent $250 million on upgrading the water, sewer, electrical systems and roads. Another $750 million in private money went into the yard. But experts said its revitalization until the past few years remained uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investment led to the creation of Steiner Studios, a 15-acre film production facility that includes five soundstages and office and support space, hundreds of thousands of square feet of new light-manufacturing space, the planned 220,000-square-foot green manufacturing center, and the planned redevelopment of Admiral's Row into a supermarket and retail center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think they understood how successful it would really be," Mr. Friedman said. "At the time, it was like, 'We're going to break even. We're going to maintain the yard.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some critics note that other industrial areas around the city haven't fared as well, with less robust public investment and a cloud of uncertainty over whether spaces could be converted to hotels or office spaces that have made companies reluctant to invest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others said that the city has made a concerted effort to boost the type of urban manufacturing and other sectors that show sings of healthy growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not going back to corsets, we're not going back to building ships," said Mitchell Moss, a <span class="companylink">New York University</span> urban-planning professor who has been a Bloomberg campaign consultant. "What makes this great, what makes New York different, is not how we build new buildings, it's how we reuse old buildings."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Maura Webber Sadovi </div><div>714 words</div><div>6 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York developer that sold a large senior-housing portfolio near the top of the market is part of a venture that has cut a deal to buy back the properties and build even more, a transaction that illustrates the divergent perceptions about senior housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engel Burman Group, based in Garden City, N.Y., teamed up with <span class="companylink">Harrison Street Real Estate</span> Capital LLC, a real-estate fund-management firm in Chicago, to take control of a seven-property portfolio spread throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island in a transaction valued at $370 million. Harrison Street, whose founders include former <span class="companylink">Motorola Inc</span>. chief executive Christopher Galvin and his brother Michael Galvin, is leading the venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Engel Burman sold six of the properties, which carry the Bristal brand, for $320 million, and now with Harrison essentially is buying them back for about $318 million. Engel Burman contributed a seventh property valued at $52 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of the properties were acquired from a venture of <span class="companylink">Chartwell Retirement Residences</span> of Canada and a sixth was acquired from an Australian firm. At each of the properties, about 80% of the units provide a level of care known as assisted living, while about 20% are tailored to residents with Alzheimer's disease or facing other memory-related challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan Burman, president and co-founder of Engel Burman, said his company sold its six properties in 2007 to take some equity out of the company rather than as part of a desire to exit the industry. "We cashed out, but we still loved the properties," Mr. Burman said. After selling, the firm began developing more senior-housing properties but was planning to brand them under a different name. By repurchasing Engel Burman's former properties, the venture can use and build on the Bristal brand name. Repurchasing the properties also enables the venture to speed the growth of the portfolio to a larger size that would be more attractive to a potential buyer down the line, he said. "Clearly, what we've found is size is important," Mr. Burman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale trails a few blockbuster deals in recent years. Among the biggest: <span class="companylink">Ventas Inc</span>.'s $5.8 billion acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties in 2011. More recently, a joint venture of <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> sold a large senior housing portfolio to <span class="companylink">HCP Inc</span>. late last year for $1.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer interest since the recession has been fueled by perceptions that the properties are less susceptible to swings in the economy because people who need assisted living typically can't time when they need to be in such properties. Occupancy rates in senior housing nationally stood at 89.1% in the fourth quarter, above the 87% they fell to in 2010 but below the 91.7% peak in 2007, according to the National Investment Center for the Senior Housing and Care Industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all investors are convinced of the upside potential for the segment, and deal volume has been uneven year-to-year. It is one of the few types of real estate that didn't see a big run up in the volume of deals immediately before the recession. From 2006 through 2009, annual deal volume was in the $2 billion to $3 billion range before rising to about $6.1 billion in 2010. Overall, there were $9.7 billion in deals in 2012, down sharply from $27 billion in 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're still seeing portfolio acquisitions but not the size we saw in 2011. Those deals took the low-hanging fruit," said Chris McGraw, senior research analyst at the National Investment Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictions are mixed as to whether deal volume in the senior-housing sector will pick up again, but many analysts expect more investors and developers to begin building new properties as prices of existing ones rise. Nationwide average prices per unit stood at $119,000 in the fourth quarter, above the low of about $86,000 hit in 2010 but below the previous high of $188,000 in 2006.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anjali Athavaley </div><div>1180 words</div><div>4 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Stern, the 33-year-old developer who has been involved in about a half dozen New York projects since 2008, hopes to join the list of real-estate investors who came out of nowhere to amass mighty Manhattan property empires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who have worked with him say he's got a good eye for choosing and improving the value of property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wouldn't be in business with him if he wasn't extremely talented," says Elliott Joseph, a principal at Property Markets Group, which has been Mr. Stern's partner on several of his deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Stern also has run into friction points with some in the business. Mr. Joseph, for example, says: "It's a little bit irksome and a little bit disappointing that [Mr. Stern] takes credit for everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern contends that the credit he takes for their projects is well deserved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern also has mixed it up with Jared Kushner, a well-known developer in New York who also is husband of Ivanka Trump. The two had a disagreement over the sale of the upper floors of a former Verizon building on West 50th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kushner had a contract to buy the property from Mr. Stern and Property Markets Group, but the deal collapsed and both sides say the other is to blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern says his way of doing business is par for the course in New York real estate. "I think that it's the nature of the business to a degree that you can't make everyone happy all the time," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also adds: "I don't think I've stepped on any toes" in the New York real-estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Stern's embarking on his most ambitious project yet: His company, JDS Development Group, has purchased a full-block on First Avenue between 35th and 36th streets for about $170 million for a luxury-apartment development. Mr. Stern's partner, which is providing a big piece of the roughly $42 million in equity, is Baupost Group, a hedge fund, according to people with knowledge of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The neighborhood is crying out for something modern and upscale," says Mr. Stern, who hopes to break ground on the $600 million project this summer. "It really is a chance to shape the skyline."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern, of course, isn't the first young developer to have such a dream. Many of the real-estate families that built New York in the last century -- like the Rudins, Dursts and Zeckendorfs -- began in the same way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these developers have needed sharp elbows to make it in New York's eat-what-you-kill real-estate industry. Having a big ego is typically a plus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, for success, a delicate balance is needed between being tough and being liked. The most well respected -- and successful -- developers have been people like Harry Helmsley and Jerry Speyer, who have reputations for honesty and fairness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are big dollars at stake and particularly when someone starts getting a lot of attention, the elbows get a little sharper," says Barry Hersh, an associate professor at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate. But he adds that in an insular industry like New York real estate, "your reputation does matter."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern says his reputation is one of fairness and honesty. He adds, "It is the only way to conduct business over a long period of time and be successful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern, of Long Island, started his career in real estate as a project manager for a developer in Miami after high school. He was hooked, he says, because it was a job that produced tangible results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He moved back to New York in 2002, focusing mainly on low-rise buildings outside Manhattan. JDS stopped buying property during the economic downturn, but in 2009 "we started making moves," Mr. Stern says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property Markets Group has been his partner on many of his recent deals. The tension over credit is about more than bragging rights. Being able to take credit for a big success in the past makes it easier to raise money from investors in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Mr. Stern and Property Markets Group's biggest successes was converting the Walker Tower, a 1929 Art Deco building in Chelsea, into condominiums. More than 50% of the units in the 24-story building, priced between $4.2 million and $55 million, are in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern says it was mostly his project. "I conceived it, designed it, built it and was majority partner on it. That's just reality." He added, "It was my baby, a hundred percent. Not a hundred percent, a million percent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His partners Kevin Maloney and Mr. Joseph at Property Markets Group say the credit should be shared. Mr. Maloney says that Mr. Stern found the property and that Property Markets Group agreed to partner on the deal in December 2009 and divide up the profits on a 50-50 basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Joseph says many of the people who worked on the project had worked for Property Markets in the past. Also, Property Markets and JDS jointly hired the architect who designed the conversion, Cetra/Ruddy, Mr. Joseph says. "We co-developed it," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When approached with Mr. Joseph's account, Mr. Stern agreed: "We jointly hired people," and the companies "co-developed the site."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Joseph says "there's no rift," and the two partners say they would work with Mr. Stern on projects in the future. Indeed, Mr. Stern and Property Markets Group are currently working on a deal to buy the Steinway Building at 109 W. 57th St., situated next to a separate building they own with Starwood Capital, according to Property Markets. Mr. Stern declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the tiff with Mr. Kushner, both sides say Mr. Kushner agreed to buy the property on West 50th Street last year from Mr. Stern and Property Markets for $35 million. The dispute partly involves an amendment in the contract that would allow Mr. Kushner to buy the building for a reduced price if the sellers weren't able to gain city approval for expanding the square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City approval wasn't obtained, but the deal never closed. Mr. Stern says: "The issue was their ability to come up with the money in a timely fashion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> spokesman, strongly denied this, pointing to the firm's $1.5 billion in transactions in the last 15 months. He said in a statement that "the transaction failed for one reason -- the seller played games to avoid selling the building to the partnership at the contractually reduced price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kushner received his deposit back. After that deal collapsed, JDS and Property Markets recapitalized with Starwood, who took a majority stake in project, Property Markets Group says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s efforts to get the economy going have helped spark a recovery in housing. Just not in quite the way it intended. Both home sales and prices have been on the rise over the past year, offering relief at a time when the U.S. has been fighting through a sluggish recovery at home and financial uncertainty overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a cursory look at the data shows that there is something unusual going on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though overall home sales are now back to 2007 levels, mortgage activity isn't. In the fourth quarter, mortgage originations aimed at purchasing a home came to $123 billion, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, compared with $226 billion five years earlier. Rates are extremely low, and the Fed is buying oodles of mortgage-backed securities, but banks are still reticent about lending money to home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The explanation for why home sales have recovered despite lackluster mortgage origination is that a lot of homes are getting bought in all-cash deals these days. Across 55 large metropolitan areas that it follows, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> found that 36% of homes sold last year were purchased without mortgage financing, compared with 15% in 2007. In some old hotbeds of speculation, the proportion of homes purchased for cash is eye-catchingly high: In the Miami area there were 72,459 cash sales last year, versus 19,625 five years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those cash sales come from people who aim to live in what they bought. But many were from investors looking for homes to rent out. What was essentially a mom-and-pop activity a few years ago -- buying distressed-price homes, fixing them up and renting them out -- has become a big business, with investment firms like <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and, more recently, foreign-led groups jumping into the fray.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason why: The extremely low long-term interest rates that the Fed has helped engineer through its bond and mortgage purchases have distorted markets, making investors desperate for yield. That has made the stream of income they can generate through rental homes enticing. So while the Fed's intent was to stimulate housing by making mortgages more easily available to would-be buyers, much of the impact has come as a result of speculation from big investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the role that investors' house-flipping played in the inflation of the housing bubble, there is something disconcerting about investor involvement having such a pronounced effect on the market now. An important difference is that today's activity isn't being driven by investors buying homes with subprime mortgages in hopes of selling to a greater fool, but by investors who are looking to generate better returns on their cash than they can get elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though it is cheering that today's activity doesn't have the speculative characteristics of a bubble, there is still a question of how long the economics of what housing investors are doing is going to make sense. And what impact it will have on the average buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are on the rise now, and with so many houses getting converted to rentals, rent increases aren't keeping up. That has begun to make rent-to-price ratios -- housing yields -- a little less attractive. If the trend continues, and if an improving economy prompts the Fed to let long-term interest-rates rise, the reason for the reach for yield goes away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Mayer, a Columbia Business School economist, further worries that some housing investors have underestimated the cost of maintaining stand-alone homes and may soon find that they aren't generating as much income from their rentals as they had anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The natural response would be to sell, which would probably be a pretty nice trade for investors who bought at the bottom. For the more recent comers, some of which would have hundreds of homes to unload, it could be a bit more trying.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Gabby Warshawer </div><div>944 words</div><div>1 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Upper West Side's Lincoln Square neighborhood has been no stranger to construction over the past decade, a trend that is continuing with a crop of new buildings that will add more than 1,000 rental apartments to the area over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood -- usually defined as running from Central Park West to the Hudson River and from 59th to 72nd streets -- has seen a raft of high-end condos and rental towers rise mainly in the area west of Columbus Avenue, and the developments now being built are joining that group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and brokers point to Lincoln Square's increasingly family-friendly reputation and an appetite among prospective tenants for amenity-laden buildings as among its main draws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest new project is 21 West End Ave., a 43-story, 616-unit rental building on 61st Street that broke ground late last year and will include a four-story public school. The tower is expected to be ready for renters to occupy in mid-2015, with the school opening in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dermot Co., which is developing the building in a venture with the <span class="companylink">AFL-CIO</span> Building Investment Trust, doesn't typically include three-bedroom apartments in its buildings, but they would be part of the design of 21 West End Ave. because of the area's "appeal to families," said Drew Spitler, director of development for New York-based Dermot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental tower is the first element in the planned Riverside Center complex between 59th and 61st streets, which is slated to have five buildings and have 2,500 units of housing when complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple blocks away, another large, luxury rental is rising: A 54-story, 339-unit building at 160 W. 62nd Street, on the corner of Amsterdam Avenue. New York-based Glenwood Management, which is developing the building, also intends to break ground this year on a parcel it owns a couple blocks away, at 175 W. 60th St., where the company will construct a 48-story, 257-unit rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Jacob, executive vice president of Glenwood, said the firm chose to pursue the projects in the area based on its previous experiences developing in Lincoln Square. "Two of our most successful buildings are in the area," said Mr. Jacob, referring to rentals it built in 1981 and 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jacob said he expected rents at the development on 62nd Street, which is expected to start leasing next year, to be in line with those at the 2005-vintage building, at 1930 Broadway. The company's website this week showed available listings there ranging in price from $4,995 a month for a one bedroom to $10,500 for a two bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenwood purchased both development sites from <span class="companylink">Fordham University</span>. The university is in the midst of building a structure next to the Glenwood development on 62nd Street that will serve as a new law school and dormitory for its Manhattan campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extensive redevelopment of Lincoln Center completed last year has contributed to the neighborhood environment, with elements such as new green spaces and a pedestrian bridge spanning 65th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, construction also recently started on yet another rental building in the neighborhood, a 20-story, 235-unit building at 170 Amsterdam Ave., on the corner of 68th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> is developing the building, and a spokesman for the company said leasing was likely to begin in late 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of new rentals joins a host of other buildings recently constructed in Lincoln Square, including high-end condos on Riverside Boulevard that Extell Development Co. built as part of a larger project called Riverside South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The push by developers to the Far West Side has transformed an area that until the mid-1990s was mainly defined by parking lots and the West Side Highway, according to Tiga McLoyd, a broker with Citi Habitats who has been active in the area for 19 years and lived in Lincoln Square since 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The new buildings on the West Side opened up a whole new neighborhood," said Mr. McLoyd, noting that before the new projects, most of the demand was for buildings east of Broadway, primarily because of proximity to Central Park, and that there was a limited amount of housing stock that wasn't prewar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It used to be difficult to find a modern condo on the Upper West Side, but now you can get full-on luxury that compares to any of the best buildings in the city," said Mr. McLoyd.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei and Al Yoon </div><div>787 words</div><div>1 March 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add one more item to the list of products "made in China": debt backed by commercial mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of China Ltd</span>. already is one of the largest foreign lenders to commercial real estate in the U.S., helping finance prestige properties. Now, it is staking a claim in the red-hot market for bonds backed by packages of commercial-real-estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> became the first Chinese lender to participate in the sale of U.S. commercial-mortgage-backed securities, known as CMBS. <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> joined a group of banks in a $950 million loan to finance a 43-story building at 1290 Ave. of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan that was then packaged into bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese bank is planning loans that would end up in to two or three more CMBS deals, a person with knowledge of the bank said. State-controlled Bank of China earns a profit from selling loans via CMBS. It also frees up its balance sheet to make more loans. The bank uses its capital to lend at lower rates than many of its competitors, real-estate executives say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> had $3.7 billion in commercial-property loans outstanding in its U.S. branches as of the fourth quarter, according to data provider <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>, almost four times the level in the same period of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are like the 1,000-pound gorilla in the room, where they have the capital to [lend at] very competitive terms," said Christopher Haynes, founder of loan adviser Broadacre Financial Corp. and a 20-year veteran of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>'s real-estate team. "Securitization may be encouraging them to do even more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CMBS market is off to a record start this year. Investors are moving into riskier investments that offer higher yields, as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s near-zero interest rates hold down returns on the safest debt, including Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMBS issuance is on track to reach $26 billion for the first quarter, more than four times the level from a year ago and the highest three-month total since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a trade publication. The $8.8 billion sold in January marked the biggest ever for that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> has focused on high-profile properties in New York with its forays into CMBS. The bank has tentatively agreed to provide about $600 million to help fund Chetrit Group's $1.1 billion purchase of the Sony Building in Manhattan, real-estate executives with direct knowledge of the deal said. That loan isn't likely to be packaged into a CMBS, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest securitization foray by <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> involved teaming up with <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> on a $900 million loan on a 1.7 million-square-foot office and retail property in Manhattan's Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending on trophy assets in cities such as New York is a "prescient first step," said Edward Shugrue, chief executive at CMBS investor and servicer Talmage LLC. He said <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> is one of several state-backed firms in the U.S. commercial-real-estate market, including <span class="companylink">Abu Dhabi Investment Authority</span>, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global and the <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing-based <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> has become increasingly active as a lender to U.S. property developers since late 2009, joining scores of well-capitalized Chinese investors who have helped fuel a commercial-real-estate recovery in U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank is the third-biggest foreign property lender in the U.S., after <span class="companylink">TD Bank Group</span>'s <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">BMO Financial Group</span>'s <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span>, according to Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese bank has surpassed some German banks -- traditionally among the most active foreign property lenders in the U.S. -- that retreated from the U.S. market after suffering losses tied to loans made during the bubble years. For instance, <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> has moved past Germany's <span class="companylink">HSH Nordbank AG</span>, the Trepp data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of China</span>'s bet is that property values have fallen enough that its lending risks will be limited. However, the bank doesn't intend to become a licensed U.S. broker-dealer, which would allow it to issue CMBS on its own, rather than only contributing loans. In the long run, <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> plans to "invest more in personnel and broaden its distribution channel in the U.S.," said the person familiar with the bank.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes are surging in the U.S., far outpacing results for less expensive existing homes and creating an unusual disparity in the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend partly reflects the small inventory of previously owned homes, now at a 13-year low after investors picked over the long-depressed market. But the strong sales of new homes also show how the nation's home builders have mastered the art of selling, even to cash-poor buyers or those with spotty credit histories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales jumped 28.9% in January from a year earlier to the highest annual sales pace in four years, according to data released Tuesday by the Commerce Department. Sales of previously owned homes rose 9.1%. The disparate selling pace exists even though a typical new home costs 37% more than one already built, the widest price gap since the figures started being tracked in 1968, according to an analysis of home prices by <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past two years, more home builders have offered to pay closing costs and arrange home loans through in-house mortgage operations. They have hosted free credit-counseling sessions for buyers with bad credit scores and have made heavy use of government-backed mortgage programs that allow buyers to get a home with little or no down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that for many buyers, it has become far easier to buy a new home than an existing one. "It's as if people were going to the car dealership and realizing that there aren't any used junkers left, so they're buying these shiny new SUVs," said Ivy Zelman, an independent housing analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, that means buyers have ended up paying more than they expected for a house, raising worries that some are biting off more than they can chew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Lynda Riley and her husband started combing listings of existing homes in Stafford, Va., about 40 miles from Washington. With past credit problems, including a 2008 bankruptcy filing, they figured they would spend $200,000 to $250,000 for a townhouse or three-bedroom home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seeing more than 10 preowned homes, Ms. Riley and her husband spent $426,000 on a new, four-bedroom house with a two-car garage and shiny kitchen appliances. Their builder, Drees Homes, of Fort Mitchell, Ky., helped with $5,000 in closing-cost assistance, and they received a gift of $12,000 from a family member to help cover the down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's much easier to buy a new home than an old one," said Ms. Riley, a 41-year-old mother of two who works as a case manager for children with developmental disabilities in Alexandria, Va. "The builder's whole attitude was, 'No worries.' They help you and they trust you. They really, really want you to get approved."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason why inventory levels of existing homes are so low is that investors have picked many markets clean of the best-quality distressed homes. At the same time, many homeowners, worried that prices haven't yet improved sufficiently, remain reluctant to list their homes. This month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that the number of homes for sale fell to 1.74 million in January, the lowest level since December 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Steals are getting harder to find, and the number of bidders is up. At some point, you have to stop holding out for a steal because you need a place to live," said Robert Tayon, a <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist. "For an increasing number of buyers, this means buying a new home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephanie Poynor, a schoolteacher and mother of two, traveled from Kentucky to Tampa, Fla., last spring. After two frustrating months of looking at previously owned homes, many of which were purchased by investors before she could even make an offer, she turned to a local builder, Domain Homes, and bought the second model home she saw, a four-bedroom house in a small gated community near the military base where her husband recently got a job. The Poynors paid $272,000, or nearly 10% more than they hoped to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted to just go buy some place and be done with it. But we kept running into other people's baggage. Either the house wasn't livable, somebody else had it under contract or you had to wait six months until the paperwork went through," she said. "This place was new. It didn't come with any baggage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have stepped up construction in response. Many of the top U.S. builders have reported double-digit growth in orders for new homes, leading to construction starts at an annual pace of 613,000 single-family homes in January, a gain of 20% over a year earlier, according to the latest Census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has been a lift to the economy at a time when overall growth has been slow. After dragging on growth since 2006, residential fixed investment, which is driven by home building, contributed just over a quarter of a percentage point to the nation's 2.2% growth in gross domestic product last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While credit remains tough to get, home builders, with help from government programs, have eased the process considerably. Most of the Rileys' neighbors in Colonial Forge, a quiet, hillside subdivision where they were the first buyers, have similar stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of January, 53 new homes in their subdivision had either gone under contract or closed. Of these, 81% are expected to use loans issued by mortgage companies associated with the development's builders, with little or no down payment, backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> or the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home builders have come to rely heavily on these agencies for sales. Housing-research firm Zelman &amp; Associates reports that 50% of new homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2012 were sold to borrowers with some kind of government-guaranteed loan, with the FHA backing 31% of new-home sales with a mortgage, compared with about one in 10 in the same quarter five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the nation's third-largest seller of new homes, said FHA lending standards now drive decisions about where to buy land, how much to pay for it and how many features to put into homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Back at the height of the market, our homes were fully tricked out. They had granite, brass, everything," said Lennar President Rick Beckwitt. "As the market declined, we needed to pull those specifications out of the homes," he said, in order to keep prices within the price limits for buyers with government-backed loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have relied on lender relationships or in-house mortgage units to help ride out the downturn. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. and others have wholly owned finance companies that provide their buyers with mortgages. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, the largest U.S. home builder by sales volume, and <span class="companylink">K. Hovnanian Enterprises</span> have launched programs to help buyers repair bad credit, and they offer mortgage concierge services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many buyers facing past credit troubles, builders are trying to expand their pool of customers by helping them. Woodside Homes, based in North Salt Lake, Utah, recently started a partnership with a local credit-counseling company to help prospective buyers improve their credit scores. Joel Shine, the company's chief executive, noted that it is easy to sell to people with pristine credit and a hefty down payment, and easy to deny people whose credit is in tatters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Then there are the guys on the border -- those are the ones we can help," Mr. Shine said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buyers have been fighting over expensive Manhattan apartments and prices rose across the rest of the country, single-family home prices were drifting lower across the New York metropolitan area, according to new data reported by <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index differed significantly from more-upbeat local reports in both New York and New Jersey toward the end of last year. The other reports showed considerable signs of strength and an improvement in median sale prices, amid declining inventory in both states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts attributed the contrasting results to differences in methodology and timing, as well as a faster pace of foreclosures in New York and New Jersey, at a time when they are slowing elsewhere in the country. Sales delayed by superstorm Sandy may have also had an impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index found that home prices across the region fell by just over 0.5% in the 12 months through December compared with a year earlier. Prices rose in all of the other 19 metropolitan areas tracked by the index during the same period, signaling a stronger national housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall prices rose 6.8% during the period across all 20 cities. Apart from the decline in the New York area, Chicago's home sales showed the smallest gain, of 2.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, one of the areas hit hardest during the downturn, prices were up 23%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the New York region fared better than much of the country during the downturn, but the area has performed worse in recent months, according to the Case-Shiller report. It showed local prices sliding each month since August, for a total decline of 2.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the ups and downs of the last decade, prices were up 43% in the New York metropolitan area since 2001, compared with 30% for the 20-city index as a whole during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, Jeffrey G. Otteau, an appraiser and founder of Otteau Valuation Group, reported that strong job growth had led to a "steady improvement in the home purchase market" in New Jersey over the last 18 months. He said median prices were up 2.9% in the fourth quarter, compared with the same quarter in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Otteau said that monthly measurements of home prices "are unstable to begin with." He said that Sandy had triggered a decline in sales both along the damaged shorelines and in many nearby communities as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, he said, the foreclosure process is accelerating as well, and distress sales often depress housing prices. New Jersey ranks second after Florida for largest percentage of mortgaged homes in the foreclosure process. It had 7% in foreclosure in December. New York ranked third with 5.8%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> reported median sale prices were up 3.2% on Long Island, excluding the Hamptons, in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier, but prices were down from the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared the Elliman report, said that the Case-Shiller data tended to lag behind data available within a local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index is calculated from changes in prices on individual homes as they are resold during a moving three-month period. Craig Lazzara, a senior director at S&amp;P <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices, said the index includes foreclosure sales conducted on the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He attributed the weak local housing market to New York's dependence on the financial sector, where the recovery in "its hometown" industry has been slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index doesn't include co-op and condo sales, he noted.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing for college students, long dominated by small players willing to put up with beer pong and raucous parties, is attracting some of the biggest names in real-estate development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., one of the nation's largest home builders, this month broke ground on its first off-campus apartment community near the University of Texas at Austin. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., best known for its sprawling suburban homes, is purchasing land near the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland</span> in College Park and Penn State University in State College, Pa., on which it plans to build upscale student housing. The two <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> projects, totaling about 3,100 beds, could open by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Brandywine Realty Trust</span>, a real-estate investment trust that specializes in suburban office space and other real estate, recently teamed up with <span class="companylink">Campus Crest Communities Inc</span>., to build a 33-story tower in Philadelphia that will serve students from several schools, including the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span> and <span class="companylink">Drexel University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves are designed to help the companies better weather the next economic recession by diversifying into areas considered less sensitive to downturns. During the real-estate crash, as prices of single-family homes declined and apartment landlords reduced rent, many student-housing landlords continued to raise rent, thanks to the generosity of parents and student-loan programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, established players in the market are on a buying spree in hopes of remaining competitive against the big-name newcomers. Last year, a record $3.7 billion of student-housing properties traded hands, up nearly 95% from the previous year, according to ARA Student Housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people think our space is hot," said J. Wesley Rogers, president of Landmark Properties, a longtime owner and developer with about 5,000 beds and 2,700 under construction. "You see a lot of new players circling the space right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frenzy comes amid increasing debate about the skyrocketing cost of college tuition and the ease of borrowing that is leading many students to graduate with heavy debt loads. Also, the companies are ramping up construction at time when college-student enrollment has slipped, falling 1.8% in 2012 from 2011, according to the nonprofit National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the companies maintain that over the long term, enrollment will continue to rise, especially at large state schools where much of the construction is taking place. And they believe that demographics support an expanding industry. More than three million high-school students are expected to graduate each year until the 2021-2022 academic year, according to the Department of Education, and many of them are expected to pursue higher education. At the same time, enrollment from foreign students remains robust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, most colleges and universities don't have enough beds to go around. American colleges are short a total of between 1.5 million and 2.15 million beds, according to research from consultant Michael Gallis &amp; Associates. Moreover, many colleges and universities lack the funds needed to upgrade current dormitories or build new ones and are relying on the private sector to fill the gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They just can't accommodate all these people. Some of them have just handed over all the reins altogether," said Will Baker, a senior vice president with <span class="companylink">Walker &amp; Dunlop Inc</span>., which financed $157.1 million of off-campus housing deals in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some industry analysts question whether some newcomers to student housing understand the hidden risks and high costs associated with the business, which requires more maintenance and management oversight than typical apartment housing. Students are notoriously hard on housing and they are known to hop from property to property, leaving older properties more at risk of occupancy declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each bed typically turns over annually, and a bed that is empty when school starts often remains empty for the entire semester. Operators also have to balance the demands of students straddling childhood and adulthood, educators and overprotective parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> says it likely will allow property managers familiar with the student-housing business to help. "The management is very important because you have three months to get these buildings leased up," said Martin Connor, Toll's chief financial officer. "You have a two-week turnover period, generally, where all your tenants move out and all your tenants move in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is growing concern of overbuilding in some markets. Construction numbers for individual cities are limited, but some 40,000 off-campus beds are in the pipeline for 2013, according to ARA. The firm tracks 71 projects under way, up from about 40 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To entice students to pay top dollar, developers are adding upscale amenities including tanning beds, resort-style pools and ice-skating rinks. Today's developments give students their own bedroom and bathroom, allowing developers to charge more rent. Depending on the market and how many students share a unit, monthly rents can approach $1,000 per bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As today's parents know as they drop their kids off at college, these are not the most inexpensive places you can find, like some of us may have experienced in our college days," said Mr. Connor, 48 years old. "They are high quality, in great locations and generate significant rent."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are concerns that some companies might be adding capacity too quickly. <span class="companylink">American Campus Communities Inc</span>., the nation's largest publicly held owner of student housing, which spent $1.8 billion on new beds last year, surprised industry watchers earlier this month when it reported that its student housing portfolio was 43.3% preleased as of February for the 2013 academic year that begins next fall, down from 46.4% at this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's still plenty of time in the leasing season," American Campus Chief Executive Bill Bayless pointed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is still early, analysts are monitoring the issue. Alexander Goldfarb, a REIT analyst with Sandler O'Neill + Partners, said he is confident American Campus will fill the beds before the new academic year begins. But "if we get another quarter and the gap is still pretty big, people may question if it's a macro issue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers' heavy construction activity has prompted <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which purchases student-housing loans from lenders, to turn somewhat cautious. "You can't help but notice there's a lot of interest now going into that space," said John Cannon, head of multifamily sales at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which purchased $1.7 billion in student-housing loans last year, up 55% from 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You want to be careful that the market's not overheating and you're not getting ahead of yourself," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason why companies are diversifying into student housing is that they believe the sector is recession-resistant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Kayne Anderson Real Estate Advisors</span>, a private-equity investor with 15,000 beds, posted annual returns that exceeded 20% between 2007 and 2012, despite the economic downturn. The firm isn't worried about oversupply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we're in a situation where you're looking at overdevelopment," said Al Rabil, managing partner of Kayne Anderson. "In almost all cases, you're looking at a situation where development is just catching up in creating supply to keep up with demand."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anthony Paletta </div><div>955 words</div><div>25 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael Bloomberg's ambitious Midtown East rezoning plan envisions a future of soaring new skyscrapers in the area around Grand Central Terminal that would revitalize a district that has seen little construction in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a nostalgic vision of Grand Central and its environs that the plan may also threaten: of the early 1900s when New York was growing up around the new station. Back then, buildings like the Graybar Building on Lexington Avenue and the Pershing Square Building joined the Beaux Arts masterpiece of Grand Central as symbols of a brash, hopeful city seizing its place on the global stage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rezoning would give the developers and property owners incentives to replace these and other existing properties with new ones. Proponents of the plan point out that the average building in the district is 73 years old and only two major buildings have been developed within its bounds in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rezoning would allow developers to put up taller and more massive buildings in the district, which stretches roughly between third and fifth avenues from 39th to 57th streets. Planners are concerned that without new development, New York could be eclipsed by cities like Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But preservationists are worried about what may be destroyed in New York's rush to modernize. The Historic Districts Council has asked the city Landmarks Preservation Commission to evaluate 33 buildings for possible landmark status, which would make it very difficult to redevelop those properties. The Municipal Arts Society has identified 17 possible properties to be saved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed landmarks vary widely in age, dating from the 1890s to the 1960s. Many, given their size, weren't seen as challenged previously. "Until this proposal no one ever thought these buildings were going to go anywhere," says Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords say that the preservationists are overreacting and that some of the buildings on their lists wouldn't be missed. Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, points out that the area was full of row houses and a brewery before it turned into a modern office district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown East "has been known for 125 years for its ability to reinvent itself," Mr. Spinola says. "It's inappropriate to say that redevelopment just can't happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midtown East rezoning plan is the last significant development initiative of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. After rezoning huge swatches of other parts of the city in its first 11 years, his administration has turned its gaze to one of its most dutiful business districts in its last months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preservation issue is tricky because the romance of the area around Grand Central stems from more than simply a few trophies alone; its urban appeal derives, in several places, from the harmonious interaction of properties, and preservationists can point to the lasting harm that rude additions can inflict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the anodyne facade of the Grand Hyatt on 42nd Street serves as the urban equivalent of misused punctuation between the brilliant statements of Grand Central and the Chrysler Building. Or consider the glaring incongruity of <span class="companylink">Murphy/Jahn Inc</span>. Architect's 425 Lexington Ave., directly to the north of the Chrysler Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some individual buildings are well worth preserving. For example, the 1927 Art Deco Graybar Building next to Grand Central on Lexington Avenue, boasts stately bas-reliefs, rain-canopy cables modeled after ships' mooring ropes and a fine arched passageway into the station. There are even iron rats scrambling up the cables supporting the rain canopy, as if they too were simply trying to make the 5:48.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pershing Square Building, built in 1923 with marvelously ornate Romanesque revival terra cotta, has stood to the south side of Grand Central for 90 years. The Yale Club and Italian renaissance Roosevelt Hotel each offer distinguished anchors to Vanderbilt avenue, echoing the mass of Grand Central with stone bases topped by brick floors and stately overhangs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turning to the north, Park Avenue offers one of the world's great showcases of International Style architecture. The Lever House and Seagram Buildings are landmarked, but other splendid elements of the streetscape aren't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The towers at 400 and 410 Park Ave. boast essentially identical setbacks and accordingly an informative study of the possibilities of the modern curtain wall, one gray and one blue. The Union Carbide Building is a bracing exemplar of postwar corporate modernism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the value of saving some of the other properties listed by preservationists is more questionable. For example, the architect Robert A.M. Stern once dubbed modernist pioneer William Lescaze's 711 Third Ave. "awkwardly massed, even lumpish" and even that might be offering too high praise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technical arguments for some seem to outweigh their aesthetic merits; innovations in curtain-wall technology may be interesting to read about, but they seem rarely a strong case for preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On balance, though, the city would be wise to move cautiously especially given its penchant for bulldozing buildings that are much missed by future generations. Even if preservationists get everything they want, which is unlikely, the considerable majority of land within Midtown East would remain open for rebuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover the city should only go so far in emulating financial centers in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Francoise Bollock, chairman of the HDC's task force and an adjunct professor of Historic Preservation at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span> commented, "I don't know why we need to look to Singapore to imitate. We're New York City; they're imitating us."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>851 words</div><div>25 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising lumber demand stoked by the housing recovery is reinvigorating U.S. timber towns, creating jobs from the sawmill floor to loading dock as the forest-products industry gets back on its feet after a long malaise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Eugene, Ore., area is typical. <span class="companylink">Swanson Group Inc</span>. says it has rehired 200 people out of the 720 positions it eliminated at its area mills during the recession and expects to add an additional 50 by late spring, bringing total employment to 800 compared with 550 in 2009. Another big producer, <span class="companylink">Seneca Sawmill Co</span>., says it has restored hours for its 375 employees in the Eugene area, who now are almost back to the five-day work weeks they had before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local Lane County officials say that, with as many as five jobs created for each one in lumber, the resurgence is providing an overall economic boost. The unemployment rate in the Eugene metropolitan area of 350,000, which is home to the <span class="companylink">University of Oregon</span>, dipped in December to a four-year low of 8.2% from 9% a year earlier and a recession peak of 12.8% in 2009, according to seasonally adjusted data from the <span class="companylink">Oregon Employment Department</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're pumped," said Glenda Poling, manager of the Lane County Community and Economic Development Division, who added that two other timber companies recently inquired about expanding their local operations. "It's just feeling really good here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene was doing well before the recession, with unemployment in its metro area dropping to as low as 5.1% in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Oregon Employment Department</span> estimates. Economists say Eugene was hit in the recession not only by the fall in wood products but also by closures of some other manufacturers, including a semiconductor plant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, underpinning much of Eugene's rebound are soaring lumber prices. The composite price per thousand board feet of framing lumber more than doubled to $415 as of Friday from $190 in January 2009, according to estimates by Random Lengths, an industry newsletter in Eugene. That is the highest since 2005 and represents a 46% jump over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price surge also has been fueled by increased exports to China, said Shawn Church, editor of Random Lengths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mills increasing production, other local timber economies are getting a shot in the arm. In Saratoga, Wyo., a private investor in December reopened a sawmill that had been closed for years, providing 80 jobs. In Albertville, Ala., Southern Parallel Forest Products Corp. said in January it would reopen a sawmill this spring, creating 130 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Davenport, N.Y., <span class="companylink">Baillie Lumber Co</span>. recently said it would reopen a sawmill that has been closed since 2008. "We feel there's going to be a gradual increase in demand" for lumber, said Jeff Lisk, a general manager of the Hamburg, N.Y., company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, logging employment as of December rebounded 7% to 51,100 people from a postrecession low of 47,700 in 2010, according to estimates from the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>. That is still 14% below the 59,200 workers in the industry in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Eugene, Deanna Stutzman was one of thousands of workers with jobs tied to wood products who were idled nationally in 2009, as the most severe recession in decades drove the housing market to a near-halt. An accounts-receivable clerk at Reed's Fuel &amp; Trucking, a hauler for area sawmills, she saw her weekly hours cut to about 30 or fewer from as many as 60.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the mills aren't cutting logs, our trucks don't run," said Ms. Stutzman, 57 years old, whose husband is a retired truck driver. "We cut back on eating out. We took less trips to the coast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beginning in 2011, Ms. Stutzman got her full hours back, as Reed's began seeing a rebound in business. <span class="companylink">Swanson Group</span> has increased its mill production in the region to three-quarters of capacity from one-quarter in 2009, said Steve Swanson, president and chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stutzmans are back to eating out two to three times a week, and they are again taking regular vacation trips to coastal Oregon. "We're definitely back to normal," Ms. Stutzman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene isn't completely out of the woods. The recession landed the city with layoffs in other sectors that haven't fully recovered, said Brian Rooney, regional economist with the <span class="companylink">Oregon Employment Department</span>. He added that sawmills aren't as labor-intensive as they used to be, which means there likely won't be the same level of hiring as before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lane County officials say they have long pushed for more diversification into areas like semiconductor manufacturing. Still, with wood products representing the largest manufacturing employer, "I don't think anything will ever take the place of the timber industry," the county's Ms. Poling said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1985 words</div><div>23 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might finally be time to come out of the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years after the housing market began to collapse, rising prices and thinner inventories are presenting new opportunities for home sellers. Some hot markets are even seeing multiple offers for the same property -- a phenomenon rarely seen since the boom years -- as buyers become more confident and seek to take advantage of today's near-record-low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices nationally climbed 8.3% in December from the same period a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate analytics company. The increase was the largest since May 2006 and the 10th consecutive monthly gain. The <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> figures include foreclosures and other distressed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains are good news for would-be sellers who have been stranded on the sidelines since home prices peaked in 2006. Nearly one in four homeowners and renters say now is a good time to sell a home, according to a survey released this month by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the government-backed mortgage company, up from 11% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You will unambiguously see more people test the water," says Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va. He expects home prices to rise another 3% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinking about selling? You are likely to find a buyer more quickly and at a better price if you factor in local market conditions and recent sales before setting an asking price, burnish your home's Internet profile and plan ahead for a home appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acting soon may pay off as well. While trends vary by region, buyer search activity generally peaks in March and April, while seller listings peak in July, says Jed Kolko, chief economist at real-estate website Trulia.com. "Most sellers would be better off if they pushed the process up a couple of months," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers could face headwinds if mortgage rates jump or the economy weakens, while the supply of homes for sale is likely to increase over the next few months, creating more competition, say real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect to make a killing. Even after the recent gains, home prices remain about 27% below their 2006 highs, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, prices remain so low that selling is likely to prove painful -- unless you are looking to buy a more expensive home at a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only reason I would sell today is if I wanted something more than I currently have," says Craig Beggins, president of Century 21 Beggins Enterprises in Tampa Bay, Fla., where prices are still off more than 40% from their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in many markets, sellers have more of an edge than they have had in years. One big reason: The number of existing homes on the market dropped to 1.74 million in January, down 25% from a year earlier and the lowest level since December 1999, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses are also selling faster. The median number of days on the market for homes in January was 71, according to the Realtors group, meaning half of all homes sold within that time. That's down from 99 days one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Tolli first put her 4,400-square-foot St. Petersburg, Fla., house up for sale in late 2009, but took the listing down a year later after not receiving any offers. She recently put it back on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel more confident, even if prices aren't at the height they were six or seven years ago," says Ms. Tolli, who has set a $1.2 million asking price for the five-bedroom waterfront property. That is more than it would have fetched a year or two ago, she says, but still well below its peak value of more than $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are thinking of making a move, start by assessing conditions in your local market. Lanny Baker, chief executive of ZipRealty, an online real-estate brokerage based in Emeryville, Calif., suggests focusing on five measures: price changes, the inventory of homes for sale, competition from foreclosures, the average time it takes a home to sell and the gap between selling prices and list prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets such as Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., "prices are up, competition is down, bank competition is down more, days on the market are shorter, and the prices being realized relative to the list price have really improved," all good news for sellers, Mr. Baker says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sellers shouldn't be complacent. Here are some steps to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Interview multiple agents. Some people prefer to handle the selling process themselves. But if you plan to use a real-estate agent, start by interviewing several contenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker of ZipRealty suggests narrowing your search to agents who have handled many sales in your neighborhood. They are likely to have the best view of local market conditions and can better assess what your home may sell for and how it should be marketed, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Vaske, a jewelry designer in Chicago, interviewed four brokers before putting her 1,800-square-foot condominium on the market this past week for an asking price of $995,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wanted to know whether they had sold any units in my building because it's a specific market in the city, and whether they've represented the buyer or the seller," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broker Ms. Vaske chose has represented both sellers and buyers in her building, and "probably knows more details about the workings of this building than most residents do," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Adjust your sights to today's market. Set aside what you home might have fetched in 2006 and focus instead on what homes are selling for today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Elsea, president of Real Estate One in Detroit, uses recent sales as his guide, paying particular attention to properties that have received multiple offers. He prefers the homes he sells to be among the five lowest-priced properties among similar homes. "Typically, a buyer will see and remember five homes at a time," he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pay attention to how long competing homes have been on the market. These days, well-priced homes often sell in a week or two, while homes that languish for months are typically priced at unrealistic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Don't overreach. Given today's thin inventories, it is tempting to reach for the stars. But if you get greedy and set the price too high, you are likely to wind up in a downward spiral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You are going to have your largest viewing audience in your first days on the market, when the house is the newest product on the shelf," says Lloyd Fox, a broker at Long Realty in Scottsdale, Ariz. If the price is too high, buyers and agents are likely to relegate your listing to the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properly priced homes are likely to get eight to 10 showings their first week on the market and an offer soon after, Mr. Fox says. If not, "you have missed the market" and it's likely a price cut is in order, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Make the Internet work for you. Most home buyers and agents are now starting the search process online, which means it is important to make the Internet a key part of your marketing strategy. Begin by carefully selecting the photos you will post online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For maximum impact, start with the photo "that is going to tell the best story of your home," whether it's the front view or a special feature, says Mr. Fox, the Scottsdale broker. Too many shots of a single room could bore buyers, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Kenneth Vaughan's Phoenix home, Mr. Fox started with a photo of the home's exterior to show its "curb appeal," followed by photos of the living room, kitchen, backyard and master bedroom and bathroom. The home, which is selling for $119,900, received three full-priced offers in the first week, says Mr. Vaughan, a retired police officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factor in Internet searches when setting your listing price. Because most buyers tend to search in $25,000 or $50,000 increments, you can maximize your exposure by pricing your home at a round number, such as $400,000. That way the house will show up when buyers search for homes in the $350,000 to $400,000 range and for those priced at $400,000 to $450,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Weigh multiple offers carefully. In cases of multiple bidders, you should focus not just on price, but also on terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparing two competing bids at similar prices, Kristine Lambrecht, an agent at Real Estate One in Clarkston, Mich., recommends choosing the buyer who is putting down more cash or is willing to forgo an inspection, since those deals are likely to close sooner and with fewer hassles. If she thinks the appraisal will be lower than the sale price, she will take a slightly lower bid if the buyer is willing to guarantee the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Clean up your act. Even in a market where inventories are thin, a home isn't likely to sell if it looks shabby or crowded. At a minimum, you'll need to touch up the paint, clean the carpet and pare your possessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzanne Peltier, who lives in Farmington Hills, Mich., hired a handyman to patch loose bricks and touch up the paint on her four-bedroom Colonial before putting it on the market. She also removed some of her furniture so the home looks bigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Kaczor, a broker at Baird &amp; Warner Real Estate in Chicago's western suburbs, advises clients to get rid of magazine racks, statues, fireplace tools and anything else that can clutter up the edges of a room. She looks for inexpensive fixes with good payoffs, such as a fresh coat of paint, removing outdated window treatments or a carpet cleaning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Phipps, principal broker at <span class="companylink">Phipps Realty</span> in Warwick, R.I., often sends clients to other sellers' open houses to size up the competition and get a better sense of how buyers may view their home. "It's a good way to do counterintelligence," he says. "It's also a good way to see what works in terms of staging and presentation and what makes you uncomfortable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Plan ahead for the appraisal. About 30% of real-estate agents reported that low appraisals had resulted in the cancellation, delay or renegotiation of a purchase, according to a January survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can reduce the chances you will encounter problems by providing the appraiser with examples of comparable sales and pointing out special features. Barbara Moody, an agent at Coldwell Banker United Realtors in Sugar Land, Texas, prepares a booklet for appraisers that includes examples of comparable sales, information about the home and receipts for substantial upgrades such as a swimming pool or kitchen renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a recent sale was almost torpedoed by a low valuation, Ms. Moody showed the appraiser comparable homes he had missed. The result: The appraiser raised his valuation by $7,000 to $129,000. The buyer and seller then split the difference between the appraised value and the $132,000 price they had initially agreed on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jan Baker, the home's former owner, says the deal would have fallen through without the higher appraisal. "I would have had to have rented it again," says Ms. Baker, a lawyer who purchased the home in 2005 for $136,900 and now lives in Midland, Texas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nick Timiraos and Conor Dougherty </div><div>677 words</div><div>22 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale fell to a 13-year low in January, leaving would-be buyers chasing a shrinking supply of homes just before the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes listed for sale in January totaled 1.74 million, down 4.9% from December and at the lowest level since December 1999, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of previously owned homes were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.92 million units in January, up 0.4% from December and 9.1% from January a year earlier. At the current pace of sales, it would take just 4.2 months to sell the existing supply of homes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report follows other signs that buyer interest is off to a strong start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the combination of rising demand and falling supply portends slim pickings for home shoppers during the season, which kicks off in March and traditionally is the year's busiest time for transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers are calling the shots right now," said Carolyn Williams, a real-estate agent in Dana Point, Calif. "What's out there is gobbled up with anywhere from five to 25 offers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More competition is good for homeowners, who are seeing prices rise after six straight years of decline. Thursday's report said the median price of an existing home stood at $173,600 in January, up 12.3% from a year earlier. Fewer options in the existing-home market also could spur traffic to newly built residences, benefiting builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are selling faster. The median number of days on the market for homes in January was 71, meaning half of all homes sold within that time, down from 73 days in December and 99 days one year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed sales -- including foreclosures and short sales, in which banks allow borrowers to sell at a loss -- accounted for 23% of sales in January, down from 35% a year earlier but still high by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' group says it expects distressed sales to fall to around 15% of the market by year-end, in part because there are fewer foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report Thursday showed that the number of American households behind on mortgage payments fell to the lowest level in four years at the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of loans in foreclosure also fell by the largest margin in the 34-year history of the survey, conducted by the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delinquencies have been falling for three years, as the economy and job growth have improved. At the end of 2012 about 10.8% of mortgage loans on one-to-four-unit homes were either in foreclosure or at least 30 days past due. That was down from a peak of 14.7% in early 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those are a legacy of the recession and housing bust: Thursday's report showed that the level of loans that were newly delinquent -- those 30 days late on payments -- fell to their lowest level in 5 1/2 years during the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're well on our way back to what is perhaps a new normal," said Jay Brinkmann, the MBA's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some housing analysts have warned of a second wave of foreclosures to hit markets, dragging down prices. But so far that hasn't happened, and the prospect looks increasingly remote for much of the U.S. The share of loans in foreclosure, though still above precrisis levels, was 3.7% in the fourth quarter, down from 4.4% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in foreclosure rates has been more pronounced in states like Arizona and California where banks don't have to get foreclosure approval from a judge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In so-called judicial states such as Florida and New Jersey, foreclosure rates have stayed much higher, leaving greater potential for "shadow" inventory that could hit the market down the road.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Schuker Blum </div><div>1774 words</div><div>22 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Los Angeles developer Frank Damavandi set out to build his modern Zen home in Santa Monica, Calif., he wanted water close by, so he built one block from the beach. But he soon realized that the Pacific Ocean wasn't enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To satisfy his yen, he spent $1.5 million to bring water onto his half-acre property. He built a 7-foot-high waterfall along 70 feet of the property line to separate it from the road. Then, he added four koi ponds in the garden, connecting them with a smaller waterfall and a creek. Finally, he installed a saltwater infinity pool and Jacuzzi right up against his house, so the kitchen's glass floor extended over the pool, creating a swim-up bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've lived at the beach most of my life, and I find water very meditative and soothing," says Mr. Damavandi. "I wanted to live in a house that really revolved around water and its calming effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water features, once a second thought when it came to residential design, are now moving to the forefront of home construction. And the latest high-end water features go well beyond yesterday's backyard pool; today's homeowners are building lazy rivers, reef aquariums, man-made mountains with water slides and massive moats. Still, builders say some homeowners aren't prepared for the sticker shock when installing these features or the overhead of maintaining them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costs for water features can run high; designers and architects who specialize in building them say the features can rival the price of a house, topping $1 million in some cases. Los Angeles architect David Montalba says that he had a client who planned to install $800,000 worth of water features in a home, only to change his mind at the last minute because of the cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining such features can be a pricey proposition, too: Mr. Damavandi says that he pays more than $200,000 in yearly upkeep, and that his monthly water and power bill runs about $7,000 -- so high that the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Department of Water and Power</span> sent a supervisor to his house soon after he completed building to make sure nothing was amiss. The intense upkeep the property requires is, in part, why he recently decided to sell the house, listing it for $18.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Good architecture has always used water," says Charles Sieger, a Miami-based architect who specializes in luxury high-rises. "A wider audience is finally waking up to that." Mr. Sieger's own house in Miami, surrounded by an 18 million-gallon moat, is accessible via a timber-surfaced bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Montalba says about half of his clients request water features today, a stark rise from the handful of people who were interested 10 years ago. "Back then, it was just a couple of our most adventurous clients who wanted water in their homes," he says. "Today, everyone seems to want a reflecting pool or a fountain or both."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water features have a practical purpose as well: They mask unpleasant sounds like traffic or noisy neighbors. Sam Johnson, a landscape contractor in Atlanta, says that, because of the additional uses, he's now building about four times as many residential water features as he did five years ago. "Not everyone can live on a beautiful, placid lake, but we can bring the placid lake to them," Mr. Johnson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the approach that Mr. Sieger, the Miami architect, took. Studying French chateaus in college, Mr. Sieger had always dreamed of living in one. So he spent five years building a 20,000-square-foot castlelike home surrounded by a 12-foot-deep, 5-acre moat dug out of an abandoned tomato field. Steppingstones carved from the natural stone base of the lake lead to two concrete gazebos, which flank the seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sieger stocked the moat with koi, geese and swans; ducks, egrets and turtles have migrated to the site from the nearby Everglades. His children and grandchildren now canoe throughout it. The property also has a series of waterfalls, fountains, canals, a lagoon, a koi pond and a swimming pool. There are four freshwater wells on site, including two for domestic purposes, so Mr. Sieger has no water bill to speak of. "That's the beauty of Florida," he says. "You can buy property on the water, or you can just dig and make the water appear instead."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugene Lochman, who runs a pool business in the Dallas area, says that he has seen spending on pools and water elements triple since 2008. "Five years ago, it was unheard of for people to drop $120,000 on a nice pool and water feature for their house. But now, it's common," he says. "Rather than go on an elaborate trip, people are investing in their backyards."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lochman is one of those people, too. A few years ago, he and his wife, Angie, spent about a quarter of a million dollars -- more than a third the cost of their home -- building a 287-foot lazy river. The meandering current lets people float around their Prosper, Texas, property or, if they want, they can paddle from the river into a large swimming pool. There's also a man-made cave and multiple waterfalls. The whole water feature requires about 45,000 gallons of water to fill and two 10-horsepower motors to create the current. He can operate the entire apparatus with a remote control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Draper, Utah, Ralph and Amanda Dlugas live in a home that was built over a century-old waterfall. A 7-foot-wide ravine bifurcates the 8,000-square-foot house, which is connected with a causeway. There's a man-made mountain in the backyard, complete with two water slides and 11 cascading waterfalls, which spill into a large 75,000-gallon pool and a smaller kids' pool. Eleven different pumps recirculate water through the mountain, which includes a grotto area with a television, couch and bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleaning such an intricate water feature can be tricky, however. "Frankly, maintenance is a nightmare," says Ms. Dlugas. "We have to get a scuba diver to clean the pool every week," she adds, noting that a green sludge forms on the rock when it's not regularly cleaned. The Dlugases pay about $5,000 a year in cleaning costs, and another $30,000 resealing the mountain last year to prevent cracks from ice and snow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aquariums are another water feature that developers say has become popular with homeowners because they can be an inexpensive, low-maintenance way to decorate a home -- or give it a unique twist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, Bill Wann, an entrepreneur who lives on a 7 1/2-acre property in Bristol, Wis., built what he calls the world's largest privately owned reef aquarium: a 24-foot-long, 20,000-gallon tank he personally constructed from concrete with acrylic windows. The tank has eels, catfish, stingrays and coral in addition to saltwater fish, such as angelfish and tangs. "I really built and designed the house around the fish tank, which came first," he says. "The whole idea of the house is to sit in the living room and watch the fish, but it's more like they watch us. If you move, they swim through the tank to follow you. They also watch the TV."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because aquariums give off a tremendous amount of humidity, Mr. Wann sealed the room behind the aquarium with plastic and installed a dedicated ventilation system for the tank. "My last aquarium gave off so much humidity that it ate away the ceiling joists and the roof almost collapsed. I learned my lesson," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost and availability of water has increasingly come into play as these features grow more popular. Developers are building in a more eco-conscious manner, constructing homes in areas where well water is available and incorporating water-saving plants into the landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In many parts of the country, water is absolutely more valuable than gold," says fish habitat and water consultant Shannon Skelton, who runs CFI Global Fisheries Management, a company that helps landowners manage their water assets. In recent years, Mr. Skelton says he has worked with a growing number of clients who have purchased large tracts of land, often thousands acres, that don't come with enough water rights, so they end up having to purchase water elsewhere -- at a serious premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some homes, water features can be actually money-saving ventures. Landscaping in dry climates requires a lot of hydration, but a lawn made of water itself demands very little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what Tommy Isola, a 35-year-old commercial real-estate broker in Las Vegas, discovered when he moved into an 8,000-square-foot home with 26,000 gallons of water features, including a large pool, waterfalls and a koi pond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My water bill is a fourth of what it would be if I had this area covered with grass," says Mr. Isola. "Water is expensive in Vegas, but to my surprise it's much cheaper to have a backyard of water than a backyard of grass."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there can be such a thing as too much water. Frank McKinney, a real-estate developer, says he regrets the number of water features he put into a 15,000-square-foot spec house he built several years ago in Palm Beach County, Fla. He says it took about 15 months to find a buyer for this property, which finally sold for $22.7 million two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Named Acqua Liana, the 1.6-acre estate sits on a piece of land between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean and features a "water floor" and "water walls." A 3-inch-thick piece of bulletproof glass covering a pool functions as the floor of the home's foyer. With the touch of a button, water cascades down the foyer's 24-foot oceanfront windows, creating sheeting water walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I could do it again, I would tone the water stuff down -- some buyers who looked at the house didn't like the feeling that they were walking on water," says Mr. McKinney. "On the other hand, maybe we were just ahead of our time."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law Banning Gay Couples</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Adopting is Upheld</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puerto Rico's Supreme Court narrowly voted Wednesday to uphold a law banning gay couples from adopting children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5-4 vote came in the case of an unidentified woman who has sought for the past eight years to adopt a 12-year-old girl who her partner of more than 20 years had through in vitro fertilization. It was the first time the court heard a case on same-sex adoptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority of judges upheld the constitutionality of a law that states a person cannot adopt a single-parent child if the would-be adopter is of the same sex as the child's mother or father without that parent losing their legal rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The judges said it is up to legislators to change adoption laws if they see fit. "Starting today, the applicant should channel her efforts through the Legislative Assembly," the majority wrote, noting that courts in Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin and Connecticut have struck down similar cases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes rose last month to the highest level since the financial crisis as the housing market improved, though the overall results for all types of housing starts were pulled down by a drop in apartment and condominium construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 8.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 890,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, driven by a 26.1% decline in multifamily home construction. December's figures were revised upward to a rate of 973,000 new homes started. Compared with a year earlier, new home construction was up 23.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up about two-thirds of housing starts last month, rose 0.8% in January to a rate of 613,000 units and was up 20% from a year earlier. That figure is the highest since July 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, was deposed Wednesday about abuse cases against priests in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, which he led from 2002 until 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An attorney for the Milwaukee archdiocese and another lawyer representing people who filed the abuse claims confirmed the cardinal was deposed. The archdiocese, facing allegations from nearly 500 people, sought bankruptcy protection in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardinal Dolan is one of two U.S. cardinals to be deposed this week. Cardinal Roger Mahony, the retired archbishop of Los Angeles, is scheduled to be questioned Saturday in a lawsuit over a visiting Mexican priest who police believe molested 26 children in 1987. Cardinal Dolan's deposition was earlier reported by the New York Times.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes rose to the highest level since the financial crisis last month as the housing market improved, though the overall results for all types of housing starts were pulled down by a drop in apartment and condominium construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 8.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 890,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, driven by a 26.1% decline in multifamily home construction. December's figures were revised upward to a rate of 973,000 new homes started. Compared with a year ago, new home construction was up 23.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes, which made up about two-thirds of housing starts last month, rose 0.8% in January to a rate of 613,000 units and was up 20% from a year earlier. That figure is the highest since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying trends in the report continue to signal improvement in the housing market," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of new building permits, an indication of future construction, rose 1.8% to an annualized level of 925,000 in January, the highest level since June 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Dept. report is supported by other data pointing to more buoyant building activity. The <span class="companylink">American Institute of Architects</span> said Wednesday that its Architecture Billings Index rose to 54.2 in January, its highest level since November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading above 50 reflects expansion, and the index is viewed as a leading indicator, with a typical lag of nine to 12 months between clients billing architects for building plans and starting construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists believe housing will be one of the main drivers of the economy this year. Spending on home construction and home improvements has contributed to economic growth for seven straight quarters, the Commerce Department said last month. Still, housing starts are below historical levels. Last year, builders started construction on about 780,000 homes, the highest since about 906,000 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Wednesday, U.S. wholesale prices rose in January as freezing temperatures in the Southwest caused a spike in food costs, but overall inflation remained tame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Producer Price Index, which measures how much manufacturers and wholesalers pay for finished goods, rose 0.2% from December, the Labor Department said Wednesday. It was the first time prices increased since September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase was driven by a 0.7% rise in food costs related to a freeze in California, Arizona and northern Mexico, which disrupted production of crops such as broccoli, lettuce and cauliflower, a Labor Department economist said. Broccoli prices more than quadrupled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slow price increases give the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> confidence as it takes additional measures to stimulate the economy. Fed officials decided during their January meeting to continuing purchasing $85 billion a month in bonds to drive down long-term interest rates and stimulate growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JERSEY CITY, N.J.—On a recent Tuesday morning, Alan Dixon, an investment manager originally from Canberra, Australia, stood in front of a four-story townhouse here, one of the latest assets he purchased for his company's shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dixon's company, <span class="companylink">US Masters Residential Property Fund</span>, bought the home on Erie Street in this city on the Hudson River waterfront for $830,000 in September. Inside, workmen installed subway tile in the bathrooms, preparing the three-bedroom home to be leased for $3,295 a month, "like something the people from 'Friends' would rent," said Mr. Dixon, referring to the TV sitcom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">US Masters, a real-estate investment trust that has raised $276 million, primarily from Australian retirees, is one of a handful of foreign firms that are betting on the U.S. housing recovery by buying houses at discount prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The business of buying-and-renting houses, long dominated by local mom-and-pop investors, has morphed over the past two years into one of the hottest investments on Wall Street. Dozens of pension investors and private-equity firms, such as <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Colony Capital LLC</span>, are clamoring to buy homes in beaten-up markets, sometimes using money from foreign co-investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only recently have foreign firms jumped into the pool. Similar to U.S. firms, they are seeking high returns by renting out the houses initially and eventually selling them into what they are betting will be an improving housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is an added bonus: Investors from countries whose currencies are strong can outbid U.S. investors because they also are hoping to make money from foreign-exchange rate fluctuations. "It's really all about the strength of the Australian dollar," said Stuart Morton, finance director for Cashel USA Property Partners, an Australian fund that is buying single-family U.S. houses. "It makes the houses really cheap."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods estimated that institutional investors had raised between $6 billion and $9 billion to buy U.S. houses and convert them into rentals. While no one keeps track of how much of that money is coming from offshore, experts in the business say the figure is rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign interest in single-family houses was evident in December, when <span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp</span>. became the first U.S.-based single-family rental company to go public as a REIT. Five of the company's top 20 institutional shareholders at year-end were from Europe or Canada and controlled a combined 5.4% of the REIT's shares outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I'm a foreign investor and I'm not entirely confident in my own economy, of all the places that I could put my money, U.S. housing looks like a really attractive place," said Lisa Marquis Jackson, senior vice president with John Burns Estate Consulting LLC, a housing-industry consultancy in Irvine, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by getting into the business, foreign funds are subjecting themselves to the same criticism that is being hurled at the big U.S. investors who are getting into the act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some community groups complain that the owners are slacking on home maintenance and squeezing out local home buyers and investors in certain communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're pushing tenant occupancy over homeownership," said John Taylor, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a Washington-based consumer-advocacy group. "Having someone guarantee that renters will be there for a long time depresses values and makes it much harder for people to recoup lost equity and stabilize neighborhoods."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defenders of outside investment groups say they help markets get healthy. "Investors are a huge benefit to the market in that they help work off that excess inventory through transferring them to rentals while owner-occupant demand rebuilds," said Doug Duncan, chief economist for Fannie Mae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with some foreign investors, US Masters is avoiding properties embroiled in thorny distress and foreclosure situations. Rather, it is focused mostly on buying short sales—in which a buyer sells for less than the value of the property's mortgage debt—and discounted homes. Prices in Hudson County, which includes Jersey City, are down 29% since their 2006 peak, according to property research company <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are buying the houses up, and I'd say unashamedly at very, very cheap prices, but I don't see much of us crowding out other home buyers," said Mr. Dixon of US Masters, who now lives in Manhattan and peppers his conversation with references to the 1990s American TV shows he watched in his youth, like "The Simpsons" and "Seinfeld."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dixon's firm is structured as a publicly traded REIT to take advantage of a treaty that allows such entities to avoid being taxed twice, by both the U.S. and Australian governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency is another big factor for US Masters. Right now, Mr. Dixon says his fund is earning a yield of 7% on his rental portfolio after accounting for operating expenses. But if the Australian dollar falls to levels more in line with historical norms, of around 80 U.S. cents per Australian dollar, US Masters' investors will earn 30% more in profits when the fund sells its homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morton, of Cashel, a former land investor in Australia, paid $8,000 in 2009, along with 200 others, to attend a seminar and workshop in Sydney on how to buy a home in the U.S. Afterward, he and his business partner, a former car-rental executive, took a six-week bus and airplane tour of the U.S., looking at potential markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, 18 months ago, they became partners with an Australian investment bank and started buying homes in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Cleveland and Tucson, Ariz. So far, Cashel has bought 200 homes, at an average price of around $65,000 each, spending an additional $10,000, on average, to renovate each one. Mr. Morton said his company is earning between 8% and 9% on the portfolio, which he hopes to expand to 2,000 homes in the next 2½ years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. rental market also has seen increasing interest from Canada, which saw its currency strengthen significantly against the U.S. dollar starting about four years ago, before softening over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Tricon Capital Group Inc</span>., a Toronto-based asset manager, launched a single-family rental investment platform in early 2012 and has since spent $160 million acquiring nearly 2,000 homes in California, Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. A Tricon spokesman said the company's net yields are in the 8% to 9% range and it hopes to own between 3,000 and 4,000 homes by the end of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Toronto-based company, Delavaco Properties Inc., founded by Andy DeFrancesco, private-equity investor with a background in oil-and-gas exploration ventures, began buying foreclosed homes in the U.S. in 2010, and renting them out to tenants, 68% of whom use Section 8 vouchers, a federal rent-subsidy program for people with low income. So far, Delavaco has bought 557 single-family homes in South Florida, and according to the firm's website, plans to own 1,500 by the end of 2013. Mr. DeFrancesco couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown and Craig Karmin </div><div>836 words</div><div>20 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, Rob Speyer sat down for what he thought would be a brief meet-and-greet with Wang Shi, chairman of China's largest residential developer, <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it ended up setting the stage for <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>'s entry into the U.S. market. On Monday, the company and Mr. Speyer's <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties Inc</span>. announced they had struck a deal to build two luxury condo towers in San Francisco with a total of 655 units, in what would be the largest condo project in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Speyer said the accord came after two years of talks between the companies, as <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> took a cautious and deliberate approach to finding a partner in the U.S., where it has wanted to expand for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We really bonded," Mr. Speyer said of his breakfast at his Rockefeller Center offices with Mr. Wang. The two exchanged cellphone numbers, and Mr. Speyer later met with Vanke executives in China. The two companies agreed to outlines of a deal in December on the $620 million project in downtown San Francisco, two blocks from the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lengthy courtship that preceded the deal shows the selective approach being taken toward U.S. commercial property by investors in the world's most-populous country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some in the property sector have been predicting that China's maturing economy would lead to a wave of investment in U.S. real estate akin to the Japanese property-buying spree of the late 1980s, thus far, it has only been trickling in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate executives say Chinese investment has been hindered by regulatory hurdles -- Chinese insurance companies weren't allowed to invest directly in foreign real estate until last year, for instance. But generally, investors in the country have simply been reluctant to dive into the U.S. market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been more noise than significant money," said Collin Lau, former head of real estate at the giant state-run <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>. He now runs Bei Capital, a Hong Kong-based investment firm. "It will still take some time for any meaningful capital to go to the U.S.," Mr. Lau added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China-based companies have bought $1.9 billion in U.S. commercial real estate since 2007 for deals tracked by <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics LLC</span>, which doesn't include some investments in partial stakes of properties or in private-equity funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is well below the $3.6 billion from South Korea, $3.7 billion from Japan and $32 billion from Canada, according to Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of what has come to the U.S. has been done by <span class="companylink">China Investment Corp</span>., which has teamed up with <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> on a number of U.S. property investments, and took a stake in mall owner <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. in 2009, among other U.S. investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China-based lenders have been slowly increasing their presence in the U.S., as well, typically confining themselves to large deals in major cities. Last year, home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. lined up a $1.7 billion loan from state-run <span class="companylink">China Development Bank</span> for two developments with 20,000 planned homes San Francisco, people familiar with the matter have said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> is in talks to provide a $600 million mortgage for the New York-based Chetrit Group's purchase of the <span class="companylink">Sony</span> building in Manhattan, real-estate executives with direct knowledge of the deal said. Representatives from Chetrit and <span class="companylink">Bank of China</span> didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> deal could be a precursor for others, although the company has indicated it will take a measured approach. "From their perspective, they want to use this as an opportunity to learn how residential development happens in the U.S.," Mr. Speyer said. "We would hope that this is the beginning of a longer-term relationship."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is something of a learning experience for <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>. The company isn't going to build the towers -- Tishman has sole responsibility for that -- although it may have a role in marketing units in China to overseas buyers, Mr. Speyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agreement calls for <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> to put up 70% of the deal's $250 million in equity, an executive involved with the deal said, with Tishman putting in the remaining 30%. The other $370 million of cost is expected to be financed with debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco tech boom has helped push condo prices higher. The cost of units in the Tishman-Vanke project are expected to be higher than a neighboring project Tishman Speyer completed in 2009, where apartments sold for $600,000 to $6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for future deals, Mr. Speyer said nothing is on the immediate horizon.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Self Storage Gains Cachet as Values Rise --- Recent Sale of New York City-Area Properties Indicates Sector's Surge Continues; Entering 'Unchartered Territory'</span>
</div><div class="author">By A.D. Pruitt </div><div>807 words</div><div>20 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-storage facilities, those usually drab buildings on city outskirts where people stash their old sofas, heirlooms and other keepsakes, are now the biggest-ticket properties in commercial real estate -- at least by one measure closely tracked by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Acadia Realty Trust</span>, a real-estate investment trust, recently sold 14 self-storage properties scattered across the New York metropolitan area for roughly $300 million to Storage Post and real-estate investment firm <span class="companylink">Heitman LLC</span>. Storage Post is one of the largest closely held self-storage companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the deal wasn't huge by Wall Street standards, it raised eyebrows among investors because the capitalization rate on the deal was low, about 5.5%. The capitalization, or cap, rate is determined by dividing the annual net income of a property by its price. That essentially tells an investor what the building yields on an annual basis, the same way a bond's yield is its interest rate. As the amount that an investor is willing to pay for a building rises, the cap rate falls. In other words, falling cap rates means rising values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 10 months ago, cap rates on storage space were near 7% -- and were as high as 9% during the commercial real-estate downturn in 2009 -- and were generally several percentage points higher than cap rates on most other types of commercial real estate, according to data from Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that changed with the Acadia-Storage Post deal and a few other transactions, where the cap rates were similar to those on trophy office skyscrapers and upscale apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was surprised by the valuation that was apparently paid for it. We've entered unchartered territory for self-storage valuations," within the last couple of years, said Terrell Gates, chief executive of Virtus Real Estate Capital, an Austin, Texas-based private-equity real-estate investor, adding he thinks on the surface the valuation appears too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Roch, chief executive of Storage Post, disagrees and says the company still has ample room to raise rents in the future. "We're not at market level [rents]. We're getting them there now," he said. The Storage Post acquisition, announced in late December, is expected to be completed by the end of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, when <span class="companylink">CubeSmart</span> completed a $560 million deal to acquire 22 properties from Storage Deluxe Inc. in a deal with approximate 5.7% cap rate, some thought it was a fluke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Acadia deal proved it "wasn't an aberration" said Marc Boorstein, a principal at MJ Partners Real Estate Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-storage had long been a sleepy market that counts about 55,000 properties nationwide that are mostly operated by mom-and-pop landlords. The sector became more popular over the past few years after catching the eye of a growing number of private-equity investors and entrepreneurs who, armed with cheap financing and dwindling options for high-yielding investments, started bidding up properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-storage landlords were pinched by drops in demand during the recent recession but remained stable with few defaults. Self-storage now enjoys record-high occupancy rates of around 90%. Landlords also have been raising rents 5% or higher over the past couple of years on existing tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boorstein said a big selling point for Acadia's portfolio was that it was 92.8% occupied, and many of the properties are in densely populated areas. The investors "feel like they have a lot room for rental rate growth," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said self-storage operators benefit from low competition because there is very little supply, and future supply is being added at a conservative pace. There are roughly 200 self-storage facilities currently under construction or renovation nationwide, compared with the 2,600 facilities that were developed during the market's heyday between 2003 and 2007, according to Mr. Boorstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until there is another wave of development that saturates the market, high valuations for self-storage properties are likely to stick for a while even as investors face slower revenue growth. Landlords aren't expected to be able to raise rents at a such a rapid clip of 5% and higher on existing tenants. Also, private and smaller landlords will likely struggle against the REITs for tenants because of weaker Internet advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rent growth is nearing peak levels. Consumers have been willing to pay, but at some point they will simply refuse high rent prices," said Paul Adornato, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are getting concerned that valuations are getting stretched," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenge facing Scott Rechler in his ambitious $500 million plan to overhaul 75 Rockefeller Plaza can be boiled down to one number: $71.26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the average office rent in the Rockefeller Center area in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. For Mr. Rechler's deal at 75 Rockefeller Plaza to work, he will need to fetch average rents of at least $80 a square foot, real-estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler is confident he'll be able to fill the 33-story tower, which will be completely empty in 2014 when <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>.'s lease expires. He predicts hedge funds and other tenants will be willing to pay over $100 a square foot for the best space in the building, which currently houses a mix of tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're always looking for diamonds in the rough, and this is one we can polish up," Mr. Rechler, RXR Realty's chief executive, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much depends on whether the market cooperates. RXR is planning a massive renovation of the building in a project that is slated to be completed in the third quarter of 2015. What the market will look like at that time is anybody's guess. Last year, office-leasing activity was in the doldrums, with 32.2 million square feet leased, compared with 40.7 million square feet in 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Cassidy Turley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 75 Rockefeller deal that Mr. Rechler finalized in December is part of a huge bet that he has been making on the Manhattan office market. He's been on a buying spree in recent years, including a deal last week to buy 237 Park Ave., a 21-story building on 46th Street, from <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc</span>. When that deal closes he will control about 7 million square feet of Manhattan space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the 75 Rockefeller deal, according to people familiar with the transaction, RXR is leasing the 560,000-square-foot building for 99 years from a venture that is affiliated with Mohamed Al Fayed, the Egyptian-born businessman who formerly owned Harrods of London, the famed British luxury retailer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal put a value on 75 Rockefeller Plaza of about $500 million, including the $250 million cost of the gut-renovation that RXR is planning, according to people familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other $250 million in value is the leasing cost that will be spread out over the term of the lease. The structure allows RXR to invest in the building while keeping its carrying costs low until it has cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architectural firm of <span class="companylink">Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates</span> is designing the capital improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Mosler, of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, led a team of brokers that represented 75 Rockefeller's owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limestone-clad tower, on 51st Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, is part of the Rockefeller Center complex and has views of its storied skating rink. It was first known as the Esso building in the 1940s, named after the company that later became Exxon, and for many years was the headquarters of <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The office market in the Rockefeller Center area hasn't fully recovered from the downturn. Its vacancy rate stood at 10.8% in the fourth quarter, down from the year-earlier 12%, but still above the 4.1% level in 2007, according to Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effective rent rate, which includes landlord concessions like interior work, was $71.26 in the fourth quarter, above the $67.24 one year earlier, but still below the $85.64 hit in early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler predicted the market will rebound further by the time the upgrade is finished. "In that time frame we think there's going to be a tremendous amount of demand," Mr. Rechler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark S. Weiss, vice chairman of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, described the amount that Mr. Rechler is paying as "a full price" but he predicted that RXR will be successful. "If and when the financial-services industry comes back and starts to hire more people, then the market has a very good chance of coming back and achieving the prices that developers need," Mr. Weiss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Rechler, the control of a Rockefeller Center property marks a high-profile step in his continued transformation into a major Manhattan real-estate force. Mr. Rechler is part of a prominent real-estate family that made a name for itself over many decades building commercial space on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company went public as Reckson Associates Realty Corp. and, in early 2007, was acquired by <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corp</span>. Since the downtown, Mr. Rechler's private RXR has bullishly snapped up Manhattan properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler said 75 Rockefeller Plaza also has personal significance because it is an iconic New York property that his late father would have liked to restore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would have been a dream for him," said Mr. Rechler, noting that his father, Roger Rechler, had enjoyed restoring a New York townhouse once occupied by Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Cassandra Sweet </div><div>935 words</div><div>15 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The use of residential solar panels is heating up because of leasing programs that let homeowners install the equipment without putting down a lot of cash upfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in solar-panel prices has helped spur interest, experts say, but most residential solar-power generators now being installed are leased systems in which a developer installs the system with little or no money down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the homeowner agrees to pay for the electricity the panels generate in monthly payments under a long-term lease. Outside investors put up a big chunk of the money needed to install the systems, and, in return, they get the federal tax credits the systems are eligible for, as well as a large portion of the homeowners' monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual funding from investors in leased residential solar installations is expected to grow from about $1.3 billion in 2012 to about $5.7 billion by 2016, according to a forecast by GTM Research, a Boston-based firm that specializes in clean-energy technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rooftop solar developers including <span class="companylink">Sunrun Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">SolarCity</span> and <span class="companylink">SunPower Corp</span>. -- which also makes solar panels -- generally offer customers monthly electricity rates that are roughly 10% less than what they would pay a utility, on average, according to GTM Research. Most contracts include a 2% annual rate increase, GTM Research said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rooftop solar developers operate in California, Arizona, New York, New Jersey and about 10 other states where electricity prices are higher than the national average, and where state laws require utilities to buy excess power from home solar generators. The leased home solar systems are generally owned by outside investors, with the developer often retaining an ownership stake as well and receiving some of the lease payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those states, the potential market for third-party-owned residential solar systems could be as much as $17 billion in annual electricity sales for nearly 11 million homes in 2013 and as much as $32 billion in annual electricity sales for nearly 20 million homes by 2016, said Lynn Jurich, president of Sunrun, a San Francisco developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By 2016, we see the market doubling, by virtue of our costs coming down and electricity prices rising," Ms. Jurich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Gardner, a semiretired software consultant, signed a solar lease about 3 1/2 years ago to have a solar system installed on the roof of his home in Morgan Hill, Calif., near San Jose. Mr. Gardner said he was looking for ways to cut his electricity bill and became interested in solar after some friends bought a rooftop solar generator for their home, but was hesitant to spend a lot of money up front for uncertain savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Sunrun offered him a solar lease. After reviewing the 20-year contract and running it by his lawyers, Mr. Gardner says he signed the lease and has been pleased with the results. A construction firm installed the 40-panel solar system in two days. Mr. Gardner said, and his winter electric utility bills fell from about $450 a month to a little more than $200 a month. He said his upfront cost was about $200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you open the bill and you see that, you say 'Wow, all right, this works for me,' " he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some critics of leasing programs say they are not always good deals for consumers, who often might fare better financially if they simply bought the equipment outright or financed it themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An average-size home solar system, which would cost roughly $15,500 or less to purchase after federal tax credits and state or local rebates, could pay for itself in lower energy costs over eight to 12 years, said Jim Jenal, who runs a solar-installation business in Pasadena, Calif., but doesn't do leasing. After that, the homeowner pays nothing for the energy the system generates, whereas the person who signed a lease is still paying and doesn't own the system, Mr. Jenal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the contracts can be difficult for homeowners to evaluate, Mr. Jenal said. "Our sense is that the leasing deals are a good arrangement for the financing people, they're not as great an arrangement for the end customer," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solar developers say leasing is a good option for homeowners who either can't afford to buy their own system or don't want to spend the money to make such a big purchase, but who want the benefits of generating their own solar power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in state policies and federal incentives could slow down the overall residential solar market's growth, for both leased and purchased systems. California's policy of requiring the state's investor-owned utilities to buy excess solar power from rooftop systems at relatively high prices is scheduled to end by 2015. If the policy isn't extended, new solar customers may not be able to sell the energy their systems generate to their utility, which would make the systems more costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utilities have pressed state officials to end the program, arguing that the program isn't cost-effective and is subsidized by the utilities' other customers. Solar companies argue that the electricity the solar generators feed the grid is worth the payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to find a way to coexist with the utilities," said SunPower CEO Tom Werner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm, which is majority-owned by French oil giant <span class="companylink">Total SA</span>, plans to expand its solar leasing business internationally, starting in Australia and Europe.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis </div><div>898 words</div><div>15 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M5</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some luxury homeowners, one home insurance policy just isn't enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get full coverage on their home and the belongings in it, many homeowners with $1 million-plus properties have to sign up for at least four insurance policies. Beyond basic home insurance, they often need policies that pay out for damage their homes may sustain from natural catastrophes, like floods or earthquakes. They also want policies to protect valuables, like an art or wine collection, at home. And most of these homeowners also sign up for home-related policies that protect their assets in case of a lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, premiums have been going up partly due to an increase in homeowner claims. For example, high-end insurer AIG Private Client Group says it increased premiums by 2% to 5% over the past two years. ACE Private Risk Services, the high-net-worth underwriting division of ACE Group, says it raised premiums by an average of 4% over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more expensive or rare a home, the more complicated the process of insuring it. To confirm a home has the appropriate amount of coverage, luxury insurers will send an appraiser to walk through the property to assess the cost of rebuilding, replacing rare materials or employing skilled workers to restore its unique features, like hand-painted murals. That can lead to an estimate that's 50% to 100% more than the market value of the home -- leaving homeowners with higher premiums than they expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insurance premiums for luxury homes vary widely. For example, on a $1 million home in areas where catastrophes are infrequent, a basic home-insurance premium can range from $4,000 to $5,000 per year, including a $2,500 deductible, with AIG Private Client Group. In high-risk hurricane zones, however, insurance brokers say wind coverage (which may not come with basic insurance but instead is sold as a separate policy) on high-end homes can come with premiums of $50,000 or more per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in many cases, individuals planning to take out a mortgage on a home have no choice but to sign up for extra policies. Lenders will require borrowers purchasing a coastal home at high risk of flooding to first sign up for a flood insurance policy before the mortgage can be approved. Similarly, many lenders will require wind coverage for homes located in hurricane-prone areas before approving a mortgage. In some states, like Florida and South Carolina, buyers often need both flood and wind coverage to get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating matters, a home's location could make it ineligible for certain types of coverage. Experts say some insurers won't provide wind coverage in risky markets, such as Palm Beach, Fla., and Hilton Head Island, S.C. Others first have to confirm the property is built to withstand a hurricane. Otherwise they'll require homeowners to install hurricane-resistant features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some luxury homeowners in California encounter issues getting earthquake insurance. Insurers must first approve a home for earthquake coverage, and homeowners there often face high premiums or could be denied coverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such headaches have led some affluent homeowners to ditch peril-specific insurance. Spencer Houldin, president of independent insurance agency Ericson Insurance Advisors, says a Florida-based client with $1.4 million of basic homeowner's insurance recently decided to pass on wind coverage after insurers insisted that she replace her custom-made doors with hurricane-resistant versions. Rather than change her home and pay enormous premiums, she determined she has enough in savings to pay for potential wind damage the house may incur in the future, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury homeowners also tend to sign up for "valuable-articles policies," which cover rare or high-value items in the home. Those with employees like housekeepers and chefs can also consider workers' compensation coverage that will offer protection if an employee is hurt, or if the homeowner is accused of improper termination or discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pooling policies with a single insurer could give homeowners more leverage: Insurers say they'll consider insuring a risk-prone home if they're also insuring properties that homeowner has in less-risky areas of the country. Bundling could also help homeowners get discounted premiums. Here are other ways to lower costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Raise deductibles: Affluent homeowners can lower premiums by raising their deductibles. AIG says it offers deductibles of up to $100,000, which can result in annual premium discounts of 20% to 40%. ACE Private Risk Services, which offers deductibles of up to $250,000, says that by increasing the deductible on a $3 million home to $10,000 from $2,500, homeowners can save 30% to 50% on premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Add safety features: Most insurers say they lower premiums if homeowners take steps to make their home safer. <span class="companylink">Chubb Group of Insurance Cos</span>. says it discounts premiums by up to 25% for homes with sprinkler and alarm systems, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Second-home discounts: Insurers consider second homes to be more risky because they're vacant much of the year, so many will offer discounts for installing safety features, such as a water-leak detection system or a low-temperature monitoring system that protects against freezing pipes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Heather Haddon </div><div>1219 words</div><div>13 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRICK, N.J. -- Like it or not, Jersey Shore residents are awakening to the reality that the beloved summer destination is undergoing a transformation never before seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterfront homes hoisted high in the air -- a defining feature of hurricane-prone communities along the Gulf of Mexico and in the Southeast -- will begin to spring up along New Jersey's Atlantic Ocean coast as homeowners rebuilding from superstorm Sandy must elevate their houses to comply with new state building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even thousands of inland homeowners who hadn't been seriously affected by storms before Sandy are now included in <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> flood plains, meaning they must raise their houses or begin paying thousands of dollars in flood insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, the Jersey Shore is set to undergo a striking aesthetic shift from a landscape dominated by low-slung homes into one featuring modern, elevated structures. The change will be "dramatic," said John Miller, a water resources engineer who is the former chairman of the New Jersey Association for Floodplain Management, a trade group advocating for long-term planning for flood-prone areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't forget people died [during Sandy]," Mr. Miller said. "We want a safe and prosperous shore area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie adopted advisory flood maps issued by <span class="companylink">FEMA</span> in December as the new standard for the state's building code. As a result, homeowners rebuilding a substantially damaged property must abide by the elevation guidelines outlined for 194 communities across 10 counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most affected areas lie along New Jersey's 130 miles of ocean coast, the economic engine of four counties with a $16 billion tourism industry. In the highest-risk areas on the oceanfront, thousands of homeowners will need to elevate their properties to withstand waves of greater than 3 feet. Depending on how high their property sits, some homeowners would have to lift their property by 8 feet or more and suspend it on pilings. <span class="companylink">FEMA</span> didn't provide the number of properties included in the flood-risk zones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm telling people to try not to panic," said Brick Mayor Steve Acropolis, who estimated that 2,300 properties in the Ocean County township were included the riskiest zones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey's maps were last updated more than 20 years ago, as is the case with New York City residents who now face similar pressures to build higher, although Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn't taken the same step as Mr. Christie and adopted the maps into building codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">FEMA</span> released advisory maps in January that put 35,000 more properties into the city's flood zones, doubling the prior total. Many property owners will have to lift their homes from 3 to 6 feet to comply with the initial guidelines released for Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens and Westchester County. Mr. Cuomo hasn't officially adopted the maps, but New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed an executive order earlier this month allowing homeowners in flood-prone areas to build higher without violating zoning rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, the shore has long featured an eclectic mix of building styles, from early-20th-century bungalows packed in rows to sprawling mansions towering over the Atlantic Ocean. While the shore has suffered from past storms, New Jersey never elevated its properties on the scale of communities on the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandy damaged an estimated 346,000 homes and housing units in New Jersey, according to the Christie administration. Storm surges of 15 feet caused entire homes to be swept off their foundations when water couldn't flow underneath, as properties built on pilings allow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitigation experts expect the use of pilings and other elevation techniques to creep north along the coast as <span class="companylink">FEMA</span> guidelines respond to the increasing occurrence of severe weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is the future," said Gavin Smith, executive director of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Coastal Hazards Center of Excellence. "I can guarantee that these event scenarios are not going to get better, they are going to get worse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 will require all federally backed mortgage holders in flood plains to abide by <span class="companylink">FEMA</span>'s guidelines in coming years -- or face a phased-in insurance premium of up to $31,500 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reality has unsettled many Jersey Shore residents and elected officials. In a letter to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate last week, Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez asked for homeowners to be able to immediately challenge the accuracy of the maps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For many middle-class homeowners, especially those who just lost everything to Sandy, these additional costs will simply be too much to bear," they said in the Feb. 5 letter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elevating a home on pilings can cost more than $50,000, especially in densely populated areas with small lots for which more complicated relocation techniques are required. <span class="companylink">FEMA</span> provides grants of up to $31,000 for such work, but some shore homeowners didn't think they could afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't conform to the new codes no matter how much money they throw at me," said Don Forgione, a 63-year-old retired Brick resident whose home was included in the riskiest zone. "They are putting homeowners in a position that they are absolutely suffocated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Christie, who has made rebuilding the shore a signature campaign, defended the new building codes at a news conference Tuesday. "None of these decisions are easy, and none of them are pleasant," he said. "Living where we live, in the time we live in, is going to be more costly."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents have disputed their inclusion in the highest-risk zones, arguing that <span class="companylink">FEMA</span>'s preliminary maps are too conservative. In Ocean County, an estimated 10,000 properties have been placed in flood zones for the first time, said Len Bundra, a mapping specialist working for Jersey Shore towns. Much of this area was flooded to some extent during Sandy, though residents said it was the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's completely unfair," said Amy Lipput, a 44-year-old Brick financial adviser whose house was included in the highest-risk zone. She said her house had minimal flood damage, with water overtaking only a crawl space. "There's no way I am going to be hit by a 3-foot wave."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">FEMA</span> will release its final draft of the flood maps later the summer, whereupon the agency will allow for public testimony and appeals. The maps that constitute the basis for future final insurance premiums are slated to finish around 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill McDonnell, FEMA deputy branch director of mitigation for New Jersey, said it is possible that some areas included in the riskiest zones could be removed as the plans are revised, but the agency has found that much of the work was "spot on" as it reviews its findings for the final draft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are confident in the sound engineering of our maps," Mr. McDonnell said. "We obviously want people to build higher, safer, stronger and more resilient."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Roland Li </div><div>1029 words</div><div>11 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- This long-struggling city is finally beginning to see signs of progress from years of economic development efforts by city officials, real-estate developers and <span class="companylink">Yale University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest step, a venture of <span class="companylink">Forest City Enterprises</span> and Concord, Mass.-based developer <span class="companylink">Winstanley Enterprises</span> is about to break ground on a $50 million project to convert the old Winchester gun factory into a rental apartment building. The 158-unit building is scheduled to open in the summer of 2014, says Abe Naparstek, vice president of Forest City Residential Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project follows a flurry of other developments in recent years that have breathed new life into a city that for decades was in decline despite being home to one of the world's top universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Successes include a new <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. store in New Haven's downtown district and a 500-unit rental tower built on a former site of Shartenberg's Department Store that is more than 95% leased since opening in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rebirth of New Haven is still very much a work in progress. The city's retail vacancy rate was 12.5% in the third quarter of 2012, far higher than the 7.2% rate in the third quarter of 2007, according to real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. The office vacancy rose to 16.1% in the fourth quarter from 14.2% in the prior year, says Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Winchester gun factory project also stalled after Forest City took control of the site in 2008 because of lack of financing. It was revived last summer after the state of Connecticut awarded the developers a $4 million grant for "affordable housing." Forest City is in talks with the city of New Haven for additional financial support, because the brick building has been vacant for decades and asbestos and rehabilitation work will be required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's millions of dollars of extraordinary costs," says Mr. Naparstek. "The only reason why it's possible is that the state of Connecticut and the city of New Haven are able to help support it to make it happen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, there's some uncertainty about the future of New Haven because two of the individuals who have been responsible for much of the progress are about to step down from their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano, Jr., is serving his 10th consecutive two-year term and said he will not seek re-election in the fall. Yale's president, Richard Levin, will retire in June after serving since 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeStefano said in an interview that he expects the city to continue to grow. "The base of our economy is educational and medical institutions," he said. "What makes the residential happen is the commercial occupancy of employers, which is coming from the growth of the university and some of the companies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Haven, the second-largest city in Connecticut with around 130,000 people, struggled through the 1990s as residents moved away and downtown retail languished. But in recent years, city officials have started to work much closer with those at Yale to reverse this course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Yale University</span> has been the anchor of the community for over 300 years and has helped stoke the growth of the city's healthy biotech and medical businesses. It's also taken steps to enliven the city by buying single-family houses near its campus and refurbishing them as faculty or graduate student housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yale also owns a total of about 200,000 square feet of retail space, which includes the Apple store, and requires merchants to remain open until 9 p.m., promoting nighttime traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yale is on a scale, vis-a-vis the city, where we can have an impact," says Bruce Alexander, the school's vice president who oversees its real estate. The school also is building a gleaming new business school designed by architect Norman Foster and two new residential colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yale was one of the first office tenants at the 80-acre brownfield site now known as Science Park, which includes the old Winchester gun factory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really has been a successful partnership between the city, the university and private investment," says Carter Winstanley, principal of <span class="companylink">Winstanley Enterprises</span>, the co-developer of the gun factory. "Could you do these projects without these partnerships? You probably couldn't."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winstanley's office portfolio of around 1 million square feet of office space among five New Haven office buildings, including 275 Winchester Ave. and the neighboring 25 Science Park and 344 Winchester Ave., is over 95% leased, with rents ranging from high teens to low $20s per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forest City, known as the developer of big New York projects like Barclays Center, has two Connecticut projects under way, with the other in Stratford. Units at the Winchester property will include studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, will monthly rent of around $1,800 for a one-bedroom apartment. Twenty percent of the building will be affordable housing. The developers have the option to build an additional 200 units in the next phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forest City is emboldened by the city's relatively low-vacancy rate among its rental apartments, as well as the success of the project at the former site of Shartenberg's Department Store, which is named 360 State Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That $145 million project, which is the largest apartment building in the state of Connecticut, has attracted a mix of graduate students, middle-aged tenants and employees from Yale medical center. Monthly rents range from around $1,300 for a one-bedroom to $3,000 for a three-bedroom unit. The building is LEED Platinum certified and has a food co-op, Elm Street Market, in its ground floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The educational, medical and health care economy never hesitated," said Bruce Becker, president of Becker + Becker Associates, developer and architect of the tower. "The New Haven economy's been growing."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building Boom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approaching?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for office space has been lethargic so far this decade. Still, economists at <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>. are forecasting that new office development in Manhattan this decade will reach its highest levels since the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a new report from CBRE Econometric Advisors, Manhattan is expected to add about 24.7 million square feet in the 2010s. That's up from 21.8 million in the 2000s and 8.6 million in the 1990s. But it's still a far cry from the 54.6 million square feet added in the 1980s, when the city was trying to spark development with tax benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why are the economists at CBRE bullish about new development at a time when leasing activity has been slow and the financial services sector is sluggish? Part of it's because some sectors are growing. For example, according to <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, jobs in business and professional services in New York rose to 653,000 in December, up 5.9% from one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the removal of uncertainty resulting from the fiscal cliff and the European debt crisis could fuel demand for office space in 2014 and 2015, says Arthur Jones, senior managing economist at CBRE. "Once those clear up, that kind of paves the way for stronger growth," Mr. Jones says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smooth Ride to Profits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercedes House, the new 874-unit apartment development that has dazzled the West Side with its zigzag design, also appears to be turning into a financial success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, on West 53rd Street and Eleventh Avenue, rented its first 222 units in 90 days after they hit the market in the spring of 2011. The 490-unit second phase, which began renting last year is now about 78% leased, according to Asher Abehsera, general manager at developer Two Trees Management Co.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Two Trees has closed on its sale of the final 162 units to <span class="companylink">Invesco Ltd</span>. for $170 million. The developer originally had planned to sell those luxury units as condominiums for about $1,200 to $1,250 per square foot, or a total of roughly $185 million, Mr. Abehsera says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But selling to <span class="companylink">Invesco</span> was attractive to Two Trees because it removes the risk of having to sell each unit individually. "It's a lengthy process to sell condos in the marketplace," Mr. Abehsera says. By selling the condos wholesale, he says, "You're expediting your exit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 162 apartments are located on the top 10 floors of the Mercedes House, which was designed by Mexican modernist architect Enrique Norton. <span class="companylink">Invesco</span> plans to start renting them later this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many schools have struggled to find new space in a tight real-estate market. But for Standing Tall, a school for severely disabled children, its nearly three-year search had become so frustrating it was on the verge of giving up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing Tall is currently located in 200 Riverside South, on the Upper West Side, but it had dramatically outgrown its roughly 1,800-square-foot space and was looking for about five times as much room. And the school needed a ground-floor space to accommodate wheelchair-bound students, and found itself competing with retailers for many of the same spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coco Sellman, the school's executive director, estimates she looked at between 50 and 60 spaces. A deal in Harlem fell through at the last minute. "When this deal fell through in November, I just finally decided we'll stay here. It's taking too much of my time looking for real estate," Ms. Sellman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school ultimately found a 10,000-square-foot space at 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, in Central Harlem, which was formerly occupied by the West Harlem Headstart Program. The school will pay about $25 a square foot and save more than $2 million because the space is already renovated for educational use.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40% of companies in the region that responded to a survey on the superstorm said that planned to place greater emphasis on telecommuting and other forms of mobile work to ensure minimum disruption to their business by natural disasters in the future. The survey was conducted by CoreNet Global, and association of CoreNet Global, an association of corporate real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the companies surveyed, 89.7% said they instructed their employees who were impacted by the storm to work from home. The next most common option was to have staff work from undamaged, occupied space held by the company (36.8%), followed by coffee shops, hotels and retail sites (20.6%). Some companies told employees they should work from a variety of places.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson </div><div>1692 words</div><div>8 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Rochelle Maize renovated her 6,110-square-foot Beverly Hills, Calif., home, it wasn't a new kitchen or home theater at the top of her list of must-haves -- it was a closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She hired a designer to create a 400-square-foot master closet with a flat-screen television, a refrigerator for Champagne, white cabinetry with silver-leaf etchings and a large crystal chandelier. Total cost: $100,000. "I wanted to feel like I was walking into a very luxurious Beverly Hills boutique," says the real-estate agent, who adds that the space, designed by Lisa Adams of L.A. Closet Design, was partly inspired by the Chanel store. "The first thing I do when I go home is go upstairs and be in that space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a secondary space designed primarily for storage, the humble closet is taking center stage. The latest in high-end master closets go well beyond the typical walk-in and are created to look more like plush lounges or designer stores. Clothing and handbags in glass display cases are lighted like sculptures; custom-designed couches are arranged near Baccarat crystal bars or dedicated breakfast areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designers and architects say for some clients, the cost of the closet can rival or surpass that of the kitchen, topping $100,000 for large, custom-designed walk-ins with luxurious cabinetry, sound systems and office nooks. Increasingly, developers and home builders aren't only installing windows in closets, they are also configuring home layouts to make sure the closets capture some of the best views and natural light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California Closets, the North American storage-space franchise, says spending on customized storage systems was up more than 10% in 2012 from 2011. Ginny Snook Scott, the company's vice president of sales and marketing, says the company has seen increased demand for high-end add-ons like wine bars, flat-screen TV displays and dressing rooms in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't call them closets anymore," says Los Angeles-based contractor Gary Drake, who says the preferred term for such spaces among the designers and clients he works with is now "dressing room." A recent remodel he worked on in Los Angeles's Brentwood neighborhood included a 1,600-square-foot master suite -- 600 square feet of which was for an elaborate dressing room. The $300,000 space had hand-oiled wood finishes, vaulted ceilings and an entertainment center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The closet is becoming as large as a living-room or family-room area in some cases," says Martin Mitchell, of San Francisco-area Martin Perri Interiors. He recently designed 1,300-square-foot his-and-hers closets for husband-and-wife clients; the closets have high-gloss lacquer exotic wood cabinetry and solid slab glass doors designed to display clothing, a jewelry vault, lighting controllable via iPad and a wet bar. To accommodate their large clothing collection, a separate wing was added onto the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanie Charlton, the CEO of Clos-ette, a New York-based company that specializes in high-end closets, says her typical projects range in price from $50,000 to $250,000, but have gone has high as $2.5 million for a three-story closet with an escalator for the wife of a wealthy industrialist in Mississippi. "It's a becoming somewhat of a trophy room," she says. "[Clients] care about having a nice kitchen, too, but that's old hat at this point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some designers say the sprawling closets are in part a reaction to the rise of modern, open floor plans, particularly loftlike great rooms that include both kitchens and dens. Having a closet that doubles as a grown-up lounge space offers a private, adult retreat from open family living spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newest luxury closets are designed to function as rooms in their own right, often with living-room-style seating with couches and ottomans. "We're seeing the closet become more of a social space," says Alison Schwartz of online real-estate tracker Move.com. Ms. Adams, who founded L.A. Closet Design five years ago, says she tells clients to think of closets as multifunctional living spaces. "[Friends] want to hang out there, they want to see what you have," she says. Going through clothes to purge older items can be done "with your girlfriends over wine." Yvonne Colacion, an interior designer based in Los Angeles, designed a massive two-story closet for a client; she says it has become her client's favorite place to sit and read a book.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For men, closets are evolving into something akin to high-tech man caves. Ms. Adams says she's designed closets for men with breakfast bars for yogurt, cereal and drinks and leather couches for watching TV. "It's a living space, more than just for grabbing clothes," she says. Interior and closet designers say glass sneaker displays with lighting from below and sunglass drawers are also popular features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showpiece closets are also an answer to a minimalist design aesthetic found in contemporary homes, becoming a practical space to house bulky furniture and other items. "Why would you want to buy some big hulking 6-foot-wide piece of furniture when you can put it all in the closet?" says Diana Augspurger, past president of the Association of Closets &amp; Storage Professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the options now offered by new technologies that were once only viable in commercial spaces. LED lighting, once cost-prohibitive for home use, generates less heat and eliminates the fire hazard of having lighting very close to clothing. Lighted clothing rods and shoe racks, and automated lights that turn on when cabinet doors open, are popular features. Window coatings that block UV rays also give the option of natural light while minimizing its clothing-fading side effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sinks for makeup application, as well as small refrigerators for delicate cosmetics, are recent requests that Mr. Drake, the contractor, has accommodated. Ms. Charlton of Clos-ette says a new feature she's including in recent designs is a "virtual styling tool" consisting of computer screens and iPads set up in the closet so people can work remotely with a stylist who has a visual inventory of their clothes to scroll through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Selldorff, a full-time mother in Boston, is currently in the midst of a yearlong gut renovation of her 12th-floor condominium. She says closet space was a major impetus for the project, which also includes expanding the kitchen into a large great room. When completed, her master closet will become the first space she enters in her 850-square-foot master suite. The space will have Wenge wood cabinets, backlit glass shoe and purse racks and a center island with a white leather top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really wanted a place that felt special and was a personal retreat," says Ms. Seldorff, a client of Ms. Adams. "When I get dressed everyday it makes it feel like a special event."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo developers are also taking note of the growing appetite. Echo, a condominium in the Miami-area that recently hit the market, will have some 2,800-square-foot units with 300-square-foot master closets, more than 10% of the total floor plan. The closets, part of 700-square-foot master suites, will include "midnight bars" with coffee machines, wet bars and a small refrigerator; buyers can pick from several chandeliers. Units range in price from $900,000 to $3.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, developers of Beverly West, a 22-story condominium with 35 residences, allotted some of the homes' premium space for closets, giving them glass walls with views of the city's skyline and green space surrounding the building. Typical closets in the complex measure around 400 square feet, and were meant to appeal to buyers who might be moving into a condo from a large home, says director of design and development Eric Jencks. Prices range from $1.4 million for smaller one-bedrooms to $22.3 million for a penthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York-based designer Jennifer Post, who has created homes for celebrity clients like Matt Lauer and Jennifer Lopez, says she has been allotting more square footage for closets lately, typically keeping spaces sleek enough that they'd fit in with the overall look of the home. "You can't tell the difference between a kitchen cabinet and a dressing drawer," she says, with custom millwork and finishes similar to those elsewhere in the house. Hamptons-based designer/builder Jeffrey Colle says his home has a 400-square-foot closet clad in antique black walnut with arched doorways, cathedral ceilings and an adjacent gym and sitting room -- features that many clients have since requested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some owners erect luxurious closets as a retreat, others can't resist showing them off. A New York building, 250 West St., recently hosted the annual Hearst's Designer Visions showcase, in which fashion designers Badgley Mischka took over a woman's large closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closets have come a long way from their early 19th-century origins, when homes were built with small master closets, typically not much larger than the door leading into them. In the 1950s, sliding-door closets were introduced, according to California Closets, and the walk-in first emerged a decade or so later. Larger walk-ins came into fashion in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designers say the move toward more elaborate closets first began five to 10 years ago, and accelerated among wealthy homeowners with the debut of the 2008 film version of "Sex and the City," when Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie Bradshaw, sees a home with a sprawling walk-in closet big enough for her large shoe collection. Mr. Mitchell says the "hers" side of his client's 1,300-square-foot space was inspired by the closet in the film.</p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis </div><div>816 words</div><div>8 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting a loan to buy a new vacation home is no day at the beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because tougher underwriting requirements and other obstacles related to a property's location have created borrowing challenges for even wealthy home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In general, guidelines are tighter than they were a few years ago," says Bob Walters, chief economist at Quicken Loans, an online home lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many popular vacation-home destinations are in the same markets where property values tanked during the housing downturn and have yet to stabilize. Some lenders say they're concerned about underwriting mortgages in areas where prices could fall further. In other cases, lenders won't approve mortgages if they receive a shaky appraisal report -- for instance, one that includes sale prices from other towns when there's a lack of comparable transactions in the neighborhood the applicant is buying into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, lenders often consider the financial health of the homeowner's association that many vacation properties belong to. If existing owners are behind on dues or if many properties remain unsold, lenders say they're more likely to pass on the loan even if borrowers have pristine credit and plenty of cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite these issues, affluent buyers are buying luxury vacation homes in larger numbers. In the Vail Valley, Colo., market for example, there were 51 luxury home sales last year each priced at more than $4 million, up from 40 in 2011, says Kathy Cole, a broker associate with Coldwell Banker Distinctive Properties in Vail. Karen Ryan, broker owner of <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> Coastal Properties in Hilton Head Island, S.C., says nine $2.5 million-plus oceanfront homes in the Sea Pines Resort community sold last year, compared with eight sales from 2008 through 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueling this demand are prices that are still declining or appear to have bottomed out. But as sales rise, some lenders say the percentage of buyers getting vacation-home mortgages isn't going up. In Florida, for instance, "cash is more popular than jumbos today," says Sandy Robertson, a senior vice president with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers choose cash because the local bank with which they have established a relationship is no longer willing to provide a mortgage for a property across the country, where the bank is less familiar with the market. Rules from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that went into effect in 2010 require lenders to provide borrowers with a standardized "good-faith estimate" of fees and closing costs -- which vary by location -- that will accompany their mortgage. The rules also say that if those figures are higher when borrowers reach the closing table, they can't be charged more in most cases -- instead another party, such as the lender or the appraiser, can end up paying the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rules have caused some lenders to pull back. For instance, Valley National Bank, based in Wayne, N.J., says it stopped providing mortgages to applicants who are buying anywhere but Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, experts say, there's a limited number of lenders willing to provide private jumbo mortgages -- which start after $417,000 in most parts of the country and exceed $625,500 in pricier areas -- on vacation homes. "You are down to a sub-sub-genre of the lending market at this point, so there will likely be fewer lenders and choices," says Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at mortgage-info website HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers in search of a vacation-home mortgage should consider contacting national banks as well as mortgage brokers, who have access to a large number of lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even then, prepare for a higher threshold of requirements. Depending on the lender, borrowers could have to make larger down payments than they would on a primary residence, ranging from 30% to 60%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some points to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Higher interest rates. Rates on these loans are often higher, by about a quarter of a percentage point, than they would be for a private jumbo mortgage on a primary residence, says Mr. Gumbinger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Credit score. Some lenders will require a borrower to have a higher credit score than they would if buying a primary home. Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans says the company requires at least a 720 FICO score, which is about 20 points higher than the primary-home loan minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Strict debt-to-income ratios. Lenders will review borrowers' total debt, including all their mortgages and property taxes as well as what those costs would be for the vacation homes they're trying to purchase. If applicants' monthly debt obligations surpass 40% to 45% of their monthly gross income, they're unlikely to get approved.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>934 words</div><div>7 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People put up with a lot for a Manhattan apartment. The unbelievable rents, the tiny closets, those pushy agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village residents are waking up now to a more uncommon quandary: a clause that allows their landlord to increase the rent in the middle of their lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40% of the 11,200 units in the historic East Side complex could see the rent go up -- by $1,500 in some cases -- because of a provision tucked into leases as part of a tenant lawsuit settlement. The possibility of the midlease rent hike wasn't hidden, but some tenants who signed it said they didn't notice, or said real-estate agents told them it wouldn't happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complex's owners could begin moving to raise the rent in April, when the settlement is expected to be completed. Local officials and tenant advocates have begun to mobilize against the prospect, calling on CWCapital Asset Management, the firm running the complex for investors, to commit to leaving the apartments' monthly prices alone until leases are up for renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are deeply skeptical of the legality of such a right, if exercised, and urge you not to take advantage of it," said the Jan. 25 letter signed by a group of politicians led by City Council Member Daniel Garodnick, who lives in the complex. Also signing were Sen. Charles Schumer, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A CW spokesman said the firm couldn't comment because the settlement hasn't been finished. People familiar with the firm's thinking said CW hasn't made a final decision about whether to increase rents. The people said the company expects to have a clear direction in the next 60 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristine Sirna, a 29-year-old risk analyst who signed a lease in October 2009 for a one-bedroom for $2,600 a month, said her rent could go up to $3,500, which she likely couldn't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't be spending such an exorbitant amount," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renter advocates said the rent-increase clause wasn't a common issue, if only because one of the most basic elements of tenant protection in a lease is the prohibition against hiking the price midstream. "What tenant would be satisfied with a lease that has an escape clause for the landlord at any point?" said Victor Bach, a senior housing policy analyst for the <span class="companylink">Community Service Society</span>, a tenant advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lease provision has surfaced as an issue after a tumultuous six-year legal battle that began shortly after real-estate titan, <span class="companylink">Tishman Speyer Properties LP</span>, purchased the 56-building complex on behalf of a group of investors for $5.4 billion in 2006 in one of the biggest real-estate deals in New York history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to recoup the investment, Tishman Speyer began aggressively converting the rent-regulated apartments of Stuyvesant and Peter Cooper -- long considered middle-class havens sheltered from Manhattan real-estate trends -- into luxury, market-rate units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants paying market rates filed a lawsuit saying a tax break the owners received prevented them from taking those units out of rent stabilization. The tenants won in appellate court in 2009, and, as the two parties negotiated a deal on how much back rent the plaintiffs were owed, the owners agreed to charge lower rents. Some one-bedroom units that went for $4,000 a month saw rents go down by anything from $600 to several thousand dollars a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, a tentative $68.8 million agreement was struck. One provision maintained CW's right to raise rents in the middle of a tenants' lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants were informed by letter, but some said they don't recall it. Others said they were reassured by leasing agents that they wouldn't be subject to midlease increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rent is very unlikely to be raised midlease, and would only come from a court order," wrote a leasing agent in an email to a tenant reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. "It is not something the landlord would choose to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons why such an increase could be impractical. For instance, few landlords would want to deal with potentially thousands of apartments turning over all at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents said they knew about the potential increase when they signed leases but didn't think much about under the stress of a Manhattan apartment search, the horrors of which are well-known: reams of paperwork, cash deposits and the pressure to make a decision immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jane Fox, a 68-year-old retiree, said she had never experienced anything like getting an apartment in New York when she and her husband moved from Washington, D.C., and signed a two-year lease in May 2012 for a one-bedroom apartment in Peter Cooper Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was all new to me and very, very crazy," Ms. Fox said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's apartment costs $3,400 a month now but could go up 59% to about $5,400 a month. Ms. Fox said the rent-increase clause was tucked into a 30- to 40-page document between passages about lead paint and air conditioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We asked about it, and they said not to worry about," Ms. Fox said. "We'd given notice to our landlord, and it was a little bit late."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson </div><div>716 words</div><div>6 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developments that combined luxury hotels with pricey condominiums got hammered during the downturn, but now a revival of these projects is under way in a handful of major U.S. cities popular with international buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is gaining momentum from the dwindling supply of unsold condos in previously glutted markets, such as South Florida, and the influx of cash-laden buyers from South America, Asia and elsewhere. Meanwhile, developers are aiming to avoid past mistakes by building only in top markets and including fewer condos in each project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those leading the nascent comeback is Barry Sternlicht, chief executive of Starwood Capital Group, a private-equity firm with $22 billion in assets under management. In its latest move in the business, Starwood and its partners are unveiling plans to convert the former Gansevoort Hotel in Miami's South Beach into a 1, Mr. Sternlicht's new line of luxury, eco-conscious hotels, with 417 hotel rooms and 163 for-sale condos, by 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Starwood Capital and its partners intend to spend more than $1 billion on four U.S. projects under the firm's new Baccarat and 1 brands, including a 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge with 193 hotel rooms and 123 condos on the Brooklyn waterfront; a Baccarat on 53rd Street in Manhattan with 114 hotel rooms and 61 condos; and a 1 hotel at 1414 Sixth Ave. near Manhattan's Central Park with 229 rooms and no condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the South Beach project, slated to open in 2014, Starwood Capital and partners will begin marketing the condos for sale this spring at prices averaging $915 a square foot, or $1 million or more per residence. At the 53rd Street Baccarat, also set to open in 2014, sales will begin next month. Prices of the Tony Ingrao-designed condos there will start at $3,200 a square foot. The Brooklyn project is slated to open in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New York and South Beach are probably the two strongest hotel markets in the nation, and they are some of the strongest residential markets in the country," Mr. Sternlicht says. "You probably couldn't make this work anywhere else in the country today, and I don't think you should try."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other hotel companies are venturing back into the market. <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. has eight hotel-and-residence projects under planning and construction in the U.S. and the Caribbean. "In the right markets, we're seeing a comeback in this," says Timothy J. Grisius, senior vice president of development for Marriott. "That's New York, Hollywood. Miami probably is the best market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Inc</span>., which sat out the surge in hotel-residence development during the boom years, is planning to test the strategy with one project in the U.S. and one in the Caribbean. A Hilton representative declined to say exactly where the projects will be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of condos attached to luxury hotels, often called branded residences, get access to the hotel's services, such as room service, for an extra charge. They also get the cachet of living atop a Four Seasons, <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> or St. Regis, something for which many buyers are willing to pay 20% to 30% more than the market average price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of what doomed the hotel-residence industry during the recession was overbuilding and too heavy a reliance on condo sales. Some projects started during the boom were built in secondary markets that ultimately didn't attract as many luxury-condo buyers as top-tier cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, developers included far more condos in their projects than hotel rooms, in the hope that proceeds from the condo sales eventually would pay much of the projects' construction debt. That strategy failed when the recession forced many condo buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht gained renown in the hotel industry by building <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels</span> into a global brand, reviving its Westin hotels and creating its trendy line of W hotels. Now, Mr. Sternlicht, who left <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels</span> in 2005 to again lead Starwood Capital, is betting on the condo markets in New York and Miami.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow, the real-estate website and app that got its start by uncovering hidden details about homes for sale, is taking a stylish turn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its seven-year existence, Zillow has expanded into home financing and rental properties. And now it is dipping a toe into home decorating and design, forcing itself to swim in waters it doesn't know well. Meet Zillow Digs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past week, I tested Digs, the company's free iPad app and website (<span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>/Digs) which is available starting Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digs continues Zillow's expose philosophy. Just as Zillow originally revealed home prices and other real-estate information, Digs is showing photos of beautiful rooms and providing Digs Estimates of kitchens and bathrooms that tell people how much it might cost them to do the same remodel in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is a good one, as most people are curious about the cost of renovations. Each Digs Estimate includes specific breakdowns of labor costs (such as demolition, backsplash and cabinet installation) and materials (such as countertops and appliances). These estimates are made by economists and data analysts at Zillow using an algorithm with real-world data from contractors, such as finish levels and material rates. They don't include structural or utility work, permits or taxes, but they do factor in a regional adjustment according to where you live and how much that might add to the overall price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow Digs will improve as it goes, but this first version pales in comparison with <span class="companylink">Houzz</span>, the website and app leader in this space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Houzz</span> has well over a million images of rooms and spaces compared with the 20,000 images on Digs. Certain items in <span class="companylink">Houzz</span> images are labeled with tags that show how much an item costs, though <span class="companylink">Houzz</span> doesn't offer a feature like Digs Estimates. Along with its images, <span class="companylink">Houzz</span> offers design and redecorating advice from nearly 170,000 professionals, including architects, interior designers, landscape architects, general contractors and home stagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People can also browse <span class="companylink">Houzz</span>'s Professionals section to see sample work and sort these pros by location and service to find someone they may want to hire. Digs seems to be adding professionals as an afterthought on its app, tagging some (but not all) photos with names of pros. The Digs website does better with a Find a Pro tab at the top of its website, but Digs currently has fewer than 19,000 professionals associated with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, Zillow tries to lure users back to its real bread and butter: selling homes. Many of the images that didn't include Digs Estimates did offer Home Info, a tab that displayed the house's address, estimated valuation, number of beds and baths and additional images. If the house was for sale, I clicked on an "Open in Zillow" link to see the listing page for the home, which included the usual Zillow details such as a map of the house's location, estimated mortgage and square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing is, I don't search for homes by starting with room designs. Like most people, I search for houses that have the right number of beds and baths and fall within my ideal location and budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I saved favorite Digs images to virtual Boards by tapping a heart on each photo, adding comments to some. Boards can be named, edited and shared with friends via email, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> or <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the boards and the comments you make on any image can't be made private, which is frustrating. <span class="companylink">Houzz</span> enables privacy for both comments and its version of Boards, called Ideabooks. A spokeswoman for Zillow said private Boards will be available in spring or summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since I tested Zillow Digs in its pre-release edition, it was hard to gauge community involvement. When I saw a design I liked and found a person's name associated with that photo, I could tap the name to find out more about the person -- in some cases it was a design professional -- and "follow" him or her on Zillow Digs. Digs can also be linked to your <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> account, to find friends who use it, though I couldn't test this aspect because Digs wasn't yet released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Houzz</span> community is involved, vocal and smart about design. A popular Discussions section lets people add polls or ask questions, and in most cases, the community helps out with these inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow Digs has a helpful feature called Similar Images, which saved me from scouring the app or website for rooms in similar styles. (<span class="companylink">Houzz</span> has a similar offering.) Another useful feature was a filter that narrows photos by space, style and cost. You can also search specific terms, such as "marble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're used to <span class="companylink">Houzz</span>, you'll know that Zillow Digs doesn't come close to its quality and detail. But for people who are curious about the costs associated with remodeling kitchens and bathrooms, Zillow Digs can be eye-opening. If the community embraces it like it has <span class="companylink">Houzz</span>, the experience will only improve.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jean Eaglesham, Jeannette Neumann and Evan Perez </div><div>1108 words</div><div>5 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department sued <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Ratings Services late Monday, alleging the firm ignored its own standards to rate mortgage bonds that imploded in the financial crisis and cost investors billions, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The civil charges by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder against the New York company, one of the bond-rating industry's three giants, are the first federal enforcement action against a credit-rating firm over the crisis. Several state attorneys general are likely to join.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said in a statement earlier Monday that the government suit would be "entirely without factual or legal merit," and denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After The Wall Street Journal reported Monday afternoon that the government intended to launch the civil case, S&amp;P confirmed the expected lawsuit and said the rating firm was being punished unfairly by the U.S. government for "failing to predict" the housing meltdown or financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for about four months, according to people close to the negotiations, but S&amp;P balked over concerns that a deal could sink the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government was seeking penalties of more than $1 billion, another person close to the talks said, which would be the biggest sanction imposed on a firm related for its actions in the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P officials also were rattled that the government was pushing the company to admit wrongdoing that could leave it more vulnerable to pending or new lawsuits by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For about three years, the government has been investigating whether S&amp;P managers pushed to weaken company standards for rating mortgage-linked deals or ignored the standards entirely, people familiar with the probe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said Monday that it "would be wrong" to contend that its ratings were "motivated by commercial considerations and not issued in good faith."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P said the government's allegations stem from S&amp;P's rating of collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, issued in 2007 that included bundles of subprime mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is targeting about 30 of those deals, which plummeted in value soon after being sold to investors, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of S&amp;P's parent company, <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Cos</span>., slid 14%, or $8.04, to $50.30 in New York Stock composite trading at 4 p.m. Monday, erasing $2.2 billion of stock-market value. <span class="companylink">Moody's Corp</span>. sank 11%, or $5.90, to $49.45. A <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal agency has been accused by some lawmakers of failing to properly pursue and punish firms and executives at the center of the crisis that plunged the U.S. into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Barofsky, the former inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, said the Justice Department move against S&amp;P looked like an effort to get "some measure of accountability" for the financial crisis, which was "something that's been really lacking across the board."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles federal court, is the culmination of a government investigation that dates back to at least 2010, former S&amp;P analysts have told the Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, S&amp;P, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> and the Fitch Ratings unit of <span class="companylink">Fimalac SA</span> and <span class="companylink">Hearst Corp</span>. were accused by a Senate committee of giving overly rosy ratings to CDOs and then causing an "economic earthquake" by downgrading hundreds of the bonds when the scale of the housing collapse became clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P suggested Monday it was being unfairly singled out. The CDOs under scrutiny were given the same high ratings from an S&amp;P rival, the firm said. S&amp;P added that it faced charges for not predicting the full extent of the housing bust, "despite [the] failure of virtually everyone to do so."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, set up by Congress to investigate the causes of the crisis, concluded two years ago that the top credit-ratings firms were "key enablers of the financial meltdown."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rating firms have said the crisis was caused by many factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department and other law-enforcement agencies have long been investigating whether the rating firms broke securities laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> in 2011 warned S&amp;P that it intended to file civil charges over a CDO called Delphinus CDO 2007-01. But the SEC has taken no action in that case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SEC was still investigating S&amp;P but wasn't expected to join the Justice Department civil suit, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The civil charges will test the legal argument used by S&amp;P and other rating firms to defend against civil lawsuits filed by mortgage-bond investors who claim they were misled by the firms' ratings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P has said its ratings are opinions protected by the First Amendment, and judges have thrown out dozens of suits based on that argument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department is expected to seek a way around this defense by suing S&amp;P under the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act, a 1989 law passed following the savings-and-loan crisis that imposes a relatively low burden of proof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Justice Department appears to be using an end-run strategy of trying to bypass the substantial barriers to suing rating agencies by dusting off FIRREA," said Jeffrey Manns, a law professor at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that a rating agency's First Amendment defense could be vulnerable if the firm was a party to alleged wrongdoing by other parties -- for example, if S&amp;P knew that information supplied by an investment bank to rate a mortgage bond was misleading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P case relies, in part, on the Justice Department's view that the First Amendment wouldn't protect a ratings firm if it defrauded investors by ignoring its own standards, according to people close to the investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illinois's attorney general in November won a circuit-court ruling to proceed with a lawsuit against S&amp;P alleging that the firm misled investors by claiming its rating process was independent and objective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The argument, brought under state consumer protection laws, sought to skirt First Amendment protections by focusing on what the firm told investors about its rating process rather than actual ratings.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>1009 words</div><div>2 February 2013</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most investors use individual retirement accounts to buy stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Gordon Berger uses one to buy distressed homes and apartment buildings, which he fixes up and rents out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berger, a 70-year-old retired college professor who lives in Santa Monica, Calif., says the rental income he receives is the equivalent of a return of roughly 8% a year, after accounting for expenses. The income helps replenish his retirement fund even as he draws it down for living expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had built that account for retirement, and when March 2009 came along I watched it lose 40% of its value," says Mr. Berger, who uses a so-called self-directed IRA. "I decided I didn't want to leave myself vulnerable by having all my retirement in stocks and bonds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-directed IRAs give small investors greater leeway to invest in more-exotic assets than those typically offered by big IRA administrators, such as real estate and hedge funds, while still reaping the tax advantages of traditional IRAs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By buying rental property, investors hope to capitalize on an anomaly in the housing market: Home prices are relatively low and rental income is relatively high, producing returns that are higher than in many other investments. It is a strategy that some institutional investors have been employing for the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the average monthly rent for an apartment was $1,048 in the fourth quarter, up 0.6% from the third quarter and up 3.8% from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year increase since 2007, according to research firm Reis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are downsides. The strategy can put investors at risk of violating IRA tax rules. And unlike mutual funds, which can be bought and sold quickly, homes can be tough to unload in an emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, owning rental units can mean fixing damaged property and fielding midnight phone calls from tenants complaining about leaking faucets and the like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the practice is starting to catch on with small investors as they seek alternatives to stocks and bonds, which often are seen as either too volatile or with returns that are too skimpy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Direction, a Louisville, Colo.-based custodian of self-directed IRAs, says that in the past year real estate has made up about 45% of its investments by new clients, compared with about a third in the past. Jason Craig, president of Entrust Group, an IRA custodian in San Francisco, says that in 2012 IRA clients' real estate purchases increased 25%, to $386 million, from the previous year, when they grew 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've seen real estate continually increase since 2008," says Jeff Desich, chief executive of Equity Trust, an IRA custodian based in Elyria, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't to say using an IRA to buy rental property is easy. Investors are allowed the same freedoms -- and headaches -- as a typical landlord: They decide which house to buy, who they rent to and where the rents are set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IRA holders must also comply with a web of complicated rules designed to keep them from using their retirement account to skirt tax law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, all property costs and repairs have to be funded by the IRA account that owns the house, says Tom Anderson, president of the Retirement Industry Trust Association, a trade group for self-directed IRA custodians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The IRA holder can't live in the house, even part-time, or put his own labor into maintaining the home. Violating any of these prohibitions can result in losing the IRA's special tax treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Desich says his firm's typical self-directed IRA clients are people over age 45 who believe they can beat the market by investing on their own. They pay an annual fee to custodians, typically about 0.2% to 0.3% of the account's value. There also can be transaction fees on asset trades, usually a flat rate of no more than a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with any IRA, assets in a self-directed IRA rise tax-free while held within the account. Withdrawals from the accounts, which are mandatory starting at age 70 1/2, are taxed as ordinary income (unlike those from Roth IRAs).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The income that is generated from the property has to stay inside the IRA account, just like a stock dividend or any other investment income, says Ami Givon, a partner at <span class="companylink">GCA Law Partners</span> in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 2% of the $4.9 trillion in IRA accounts in 2011 was in self-directed IRAs, according to the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>. But Clay Malcolm, director of business development at New Direction, says real estate is gaining momentum. "It's a physical asset [investors] understand," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what attracted Tim Marshall, 59, a retired business analyst in Johnstown, Colo. When Mr. Marshall retired from <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> in 2005, he rolled over his 401(k) account into an IRA. Since 2009, he has purchased seven homes with about $700,000 from his IRA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marshall says he is getting an annual return of about 10%. Six of the properties he purchased had been in foreclosure. "Part of my purchasing strategy is take what the property sold for in 2005 and try to buy for no more than 70 [percent]," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike stocks and bonds, though, homes require a lot of oversight. Mr. Marshall has had to deal with annoyances, including one tenant who moved in and never paid rent. Mr. Marshall took the tenant's deposit but still lost about a month's rent and had to spend about $500 repairing damage, such as a hole the tenant kicked in the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If someone leaves and they stiff you for it, well, OK, I lost $1,000," he says. During the 2009 stock-market swoon, "I lost tens of thousands."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Homes Inc</span>. climbed 12% in its trading debut, the sector's first IPO in more than eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the single-family home builder rose $2.05, to $19.05, on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> on Thursday. TRI Pointe priced 13.7 million shares at $17, above the original $14-to-$16 range, valuing the deal at $233 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last IPO from a builder came from <span class="companylink">Comstock Homebuilding Cos</span>., now known as Comstock Holding Cos., in December 2004, according to data provider Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRI Pointe, of Irvine, Calif., builds homes in planned communities mostly in major cities in Northern and Southern California. The company plans to open its first community in Colorado in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the worst housing slump in generations, steadily improving data on home prices, home sales and construction permits have recently juiced housing stocks. This month, <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. both reported a surge in fourth-quarter profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers and investors have said the improvements are helping bring more housing-related companies to the IPO market. Next week, plywood maker <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade LLC</span> will launch an IPO valued at as high as $212 million. <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>., a single-family home builder, disclosed its plans to go public last year but hasn't set a date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data have shown home prices climbing in each of TRI Pointe's markets. "TRI Pointe is a company that's coming out at the right time and in the right part of the country," said Sal Morreale, an institutional-sales trader who tracks IPOs for <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span> in Los Angeles. "The housing market in Southern California is hot, so it's not surprising to see strong demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, animal-medicine maker <span class="companylink">Zoetis Inc</span>. priced its initial public offering above expectations, a strong showing for the largest deal from a U.S. company since <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span>.'s $16 billion debut last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Zoetis</span>, which is being carved into a stand-alone company by drug maker <span class="companylink">Pfizer Inc</span>., priced 86.1 million Class A shares at $26 apiece, according to an underwriter familiar with the deal's terms. The deal priced above the $22-to-$25 range. Shares will begin trading Friday on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span>.</p>
