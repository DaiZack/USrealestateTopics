<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home buyers in the U.S. are going for jumbo loans—and not just in hot luxury markets like Manhattan and San Francisco. Buyers in Denver, Portland, Ore., and even Detroit are increasingly getting jumbos as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes that would require borrowers to get a jumbo mortgage with a 25% down payment has increased 13% in 25 top metro areas since 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, a real-estate information website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been steadily rising since January 2012[http://graphics.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/us-housing-market/], when home values hit bottom in many markets, says Svenja Gudell, senior director of economic research at Zillow. As a result, more buyers seeking financing need jumbo loans—mortgages that in most parts of the country exceed the $417,000 limit on government-backed loans ($625,500 in high-cost areas).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a closer look at three local markets seeing a bump in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PORTLAND, ORE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes here that would require a jumbo mortgage for financing almost doubled (89% increase) from 4.2% in 2012 to 8% today, according to Zillow. In Portland, the conforming-loan limit is $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Portland market has revved up in the past two years but especially in the last six months, says Shannon Baird, a real-estate broker with Portland-based Meadows Group Realtors. Many buyers hail from out of state[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/best-places-to-retire-portland-ore-1426475062], attracted by the temperate climate, cultural activities, restaurant scene and outdoor activities[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702303561504577494692043055870], she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron and Arlene Unverzagt, both age 43, saw Portland as a great place to raise their two children, Jack, age 6, and Zoe, age 3. “Portland is family friendly, the size is manageable, and we can travel easily to Mount Hood, central Oregon and the coast all within an hour," says Mr. Unverzagt, a stay-at-home dad whose wife is a marketing executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To score their 3,300-square-foot, Midcentury-Modern home in the Wilcox Estates neighborhood in May, Mr. Unverzagt says he made a rapid offer right at the $825,000 asking price, waived appraisal and home-inspection contingencies and even wrote a personal letter to the sellers. They made a 20% down payment and financed the purchase with a jumbo mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of fierce competition, jumbo borrowers have to state upfront that they are willing to make larger down payments if appraisals can't keep up with rapid home appreciation, says Steph Noble, a mortgage consultant for Guild Mortgage in Portland, who handled the Unverzagts' jumbo loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese cash buyers looking for investment properties are a significant part of the current Portland market, Ms. Baird says. Homes priced $700,000 to $1 million often attract as many as 10 offers—some up to $100,000 above the asking price, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home value in Portland was $286,200 in May 2015, only 2.1% lower than its peak of $292,300 in April 2007, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, 11.2% of homes listed would require a jumbo mortgage for financing, an 82.3% jump since 2012, according to Zillow. Home-price appreciation has been so rapid that Denver is one of only a few places nationwide where government loan limits were raised from $417,000 to $424,350 in 2015. The median home price climbed to $297,700 in May 2015, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some neighborhoods[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424127887323646604578404961792270572], it's not uncommon for buyers to make higher down payments to make up for gaps between appraisal values and approved loan amounts, says Chris Magnotta, a Denver-based Guild Mortgage mortgage consultant. “A year ago, when an appraisal came in low, it was on the seller to bring the price down, but now it's flip-flopped," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Colorado's capital, a booming economy and job growth[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/property-boom-has-denver-building-new-rocky-mountain-high-1433842201]are the main drivers attracting today's transplants, says David Ness, managing broker for Denver-based Thrive Real Estate Group. Of 46 deals that he brokered from January through May, 43 sold for above list price, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A virtual standstill in new-home construction over the past decade is driving prices even higher, Mr. Ness says. In 2006, there were 35,000 home listings. Now there are just 6,909, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 1.9% of homes listed in the Motor City would require a jumbo loan, but that's 108% higher than in 2012[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/developments/2014/11/07/any-positive-news-a-boon-for-detroit-housing-market/], according to Zillow. In Detroit, conforming loan limits are $417,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Mike Blake, a real-estate agent with Detroit's Century 21 AAA North office, sold a 5,600-square-foot home in the suburb of Oxford for $1.8 million. “I have never seen so many $1 million houses[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/where-luxury-homes-sell-the-fastest-1429028433]up and selling, and there are a lot of new builders moving in, too," Mr. Blake says. “Detroit follows the auto industry[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/detroits-historic-market-key-to-citys-future-1411704028], and the auto industry is excelling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current Detroit buyers tend to be small-business owners or auto-industry executives buying up. And some of them have a recession-era bankruptcy or foreclosure on their credit reports, he adds. If those borrowers with one-time credit strikes now have sufficient income, some community banks are willing to lend, Mr. Blake says. “I know of two people who filed for bankruptcy in 2012 and got jumbo loans this year," he notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices in Detroit were $115,300 in May, still 26.9% lower than their June 2005 peak, according to Zillow.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Landfills Don’t Always Trash Home Values; Whether waste sites have a negative effect on surrounding property prices depends on how close they are and how big</span>
</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski   </div><div>466 words</div><div>8 July 2015</div><div>11:38</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person might expect that a landfill would always negatively impact the value[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/SB10001424052702304773104579270660999230736] of neighboring properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so, says Montana State University professor Richard Ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While essentially all high-volume landfills drag down surrounding home prices, his research has found that some lower-volume facilities can leave nearby homeowners unscathed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2010 Journal of Real Estate Research study, Dr. Ready determined that roughly one-quarter of landfills processing less than 500 tons of waste a day have no negative effect on surrounding home values. On average, low-volume landfills pull down adjacent property values by 2.7%, with prices going back up by 1.3% with each additional mile a house is from the landfill. (The study didn't identify the characteristics of low-volume landfills that have a negative impact and those that don't.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-volume landfills (equaling or exceeding 500 tons of waste a day), on the other hand, drop adjacent property values by 13.7% on average, with that pricing impact decreasing by 5.9% a mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, if you must live near the dump, do try to make sure it's a small one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Ready notes that a number of earlier studies had shown little or no effect of some landfills on home values, but that there were concerns as to whether those findings were due to small sample sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the JRER paper, he used a meta-analysis of all available landfill/housing-price studies, along with original data from three Pennsylvania landfills, to better get at the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And with this analysis we found that, yes, there really are differences between landfills, and we can say with high confidence that not every landfill has the same effect," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent studies have found similar correlations between landfill proximity and home value, but Dr. Ready says he isn't aware of any that have compared sites by volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at waste volume made sense in that it is likely correlated with other factors, such as a landfill's truck traffic, physical footprint and visibility, Dr. Ready notes. It is also relatively straightforward to compare across sites, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less easy to account for is the “aesthetic prominence of the landfill on the surrounding landscape," he says. “Some landfills you can see from miles around and others, if you didn't know they were there, you wouldn't be able to tell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My intuition tells me that aesthetic prominence must matter," he adds. “But without visiting every landfill that has ever been studied it's really hard to get good measures of their aesthetic prominence."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Developer Five Point Files for IPO; Rebound in home prices could help builders after yearlong lull in offerings</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>584 words</div><div>7 July 2015</div><div>17:56</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California developer <span class="companylink">Five Point Holdings Inc</span>. filed a draft registration statement with regulators outlining an initial public offering, providing a test of investors' appetite for housing-related offerings after a yearlong lull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in the first five months of this year were up 23% from the same period a year ago amid job growth. The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> U.S. Home Construction Index of the stocks of six large builders is up 10.2% so far this year, reaching a five-year high in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the last wave of home-builder IPOs, which came in 2013 and the first half of 2014, have brought mixed results, with five of the eight builders trading at or below their IPO prices. No other builders have gone public since June 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five Point, partly owned by home-building giant <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., develops communities and sells home lots to builders. The firm operates California projects cumulatively spanning tens of thousands of home sites and billions of dollars in development costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An IPO likely would help Five Point finance the huge costs of developing those projects, including additional infrastructure and marketing efforts. Its release on Tuesday and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s associated filings with the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> didn't disclose details about its financial performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span> formed Five Point in 2009 to oversee massive redevelopment projects it had taken on in California. Those include multiyear projects to redevelop into housing and commercial uses the former naval shipyard at Hunters Point in San Francisco and the former El Toro military base in Irvine, Calif. Five Point is developing six projects in California spanning 50,000 potential home sites and 20 million square feet of commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five Point's consolidation will shuffle its ownership. A few investors in some of its projects, including Barry Sternlicht's <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span> and Michael Dell's MSD Capital, intend to sell some of their stakes as part of the eventual IPO. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, meanwhile, will retain an estimated one-third ownership stake as Five Point's largest investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, Five Point, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and affiliates are moving ahead on development of the former naval bases at the Hunters Point Shipyard and Treasure Island, having drawn new financing for them after $1.7 billion in funding from <span class="companylink">China Development Bank</span> fell through in 2013. The state-run Chinese bank withdrew partly because of its leadership transition at the time and partly due to challenges with American tax requirements, people familiar with the matter said. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and Five Point since have landed financing from other lenders and from investors in the EB-5 visa program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Tuesday, Florida home builder <span class="companylink">WCI Communities Inc</span>., which went public in 2013, registered Tuesday to sell 3.25 million shares held by two of its largest investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WCI, based in Bonita Springs, Fla., is one of the four newly public builders currently exceeding their IPO prices. As of midday Tuesday, WCI's stock traded at nearly 55% above its July 2013 IPO price of $15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WCI registered Tuesday to sell shares held by private-equity investors Monarch Alternative Capital LP and Stonehill Capital Management LLC. If all of the shares are sold, including the overallotment, it would reduce the pair's stake in WCI to a combined 24.8% from 39.2%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Knutson   </div><div>1121 words</div><div>30 June 2015</div><div>18:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Kara Burke and Tom Cairns thought they had found their ideal house: a nicely-updated older three-bedroom home in Worthington, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they didn't make an offer because it didn't have high speed Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We wouldn't choose a house that didn't have electricity," Ms. Burke, 26 years old, said as she explained why. “It's right on par with those things."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Internet becomes central to the way Americans work and live, the digital divide is taking on greater economic significance. Students without Internet access at home may struggle to keep up with school assignments. Towns with less access find themselves falling behind economically, researchers say. Now, the availability of speedy Internet service is starting to affect Americans' biggest purchase: their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents across the country say more buyers like Ms. Burke and Mr. Cairns are turning their noses up at homes without fast Web access. Some studies suggest those buyers are having a keen effect on home prices. A nationwide study released on Monday by researchers at the <span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span> and <span class="companylink">Carnegie Mellon University</span> finds fiber-optic connections, the fastest type of high speed Internet available, can add $5,437 to the price of a $175,000 home—about as much as a fireplace, or half the value of a bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Mans, a real-estate agent outside Boulder, Colo., said after he started noting in his online listings whether properties had Internet availability, he got fewer calls about properties that didn't have it. “I have situations where people won't even look at it if it doesn't have broadband," Mr. Mans said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What people want in a home can vary a lot, and values can depend heavily on broader market forces. But real estate professionals say there are certain features that can be a deciding factor—like an extra bathroom or pool. And broadband is starting to figure into that same calculus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telecom companies by law are required to make telephone service available to every residence in their service areas, but the same isn't true for all high speed Internet providers. Phone lines can deliver DSL service, typically slower than 10 megabits a second. Satellite service is usually even slower. Fiber and some cable can deliver speeds of up to 1,000 megabits a second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">University of Colorado</span> researchers compared more than 520,000 home sales between 2011 and 2013 against government data on the type of Internet access available. It built on a 2013 study by the same researchers that found a similar effect on home prices in New York state. The researchers expanded their study with funding from The Fiber to the Home Council Americas, a group made up of municipalities, small telecom companies, and others like <span class="companylink">Google Inc</span>. that support the expansion of fiber networks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results mirrored the findings of a 2014 study by the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater that found access to the Internet could add $11,815 to the value of a $439,000 vacation house in Door County, Wis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact is most acute in rural areas, where Internet speeds tend to drop dramatically. As of 2013, 92% of urban areas had high speed Internet, compared with 47% of rural areas, according to the most recent data from the <span class="companylink">Federal Communications Commission</span>. The <span class="companylink">FCC</span> defines high speed as 25 megabits per second or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Wilczak was getting wireless high speed Internet via <span class="companylink">Verizon</span>'s cell towers at his home in Santa Ynez, Calif., a town of about 4,400 near Santa Barbara. Cable and phone companies sell high speed Internet downtown, but they hadn't built along his street. Mr. Wilczak's <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> service worked like a cellphone plan. Once when friends brought their children for a week-long visit, the children blew past his 50 gigabyte monthly cap and he was hit with a more than $900 bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilczak recently moved to a new house and dropped <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> in favor of a local wireless Internet company without data caps. He said at least half of the 40 people who considered buying his old house weren't interested in part because it lacked reliable Internet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unreliable Internet almost derailed Adam Frost's online business selling wooden toys made in European workshops. Mr. Frost tried using satellite Internet when he first moved to New Salem, Mass., about seven years ago from a New York City suburb, where he was paying about $60 a month for high speed Internet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were told there was adequate Internet access when we got up here, and then discovered there really isn't," Mr. Frost said. The satellite service would go down during bad weather, and he consistently went over his monthly data limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Frost decided to pay <span class="companylink">Verizon</span> $600 a month to install a dedicated copper wire to his house for more reliable service. But it still isn't fast enough, especially as online services grow more data intensive. Last year it took him 24 hours to download a software update for his computer, and just as the download was nearly finished, his connection crashed and he had to start all over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Western Massachusetts, where Mr. Frost lives, local officials are trying to solve the problem by building their own high speed networks. To accomplish that they're borrowing a tactic developed a century ago when the region was struggling to gain access to electricity. More than 40 towns have formed a cooperative of Municipal Lighting Plants, a type of public utility first invented to build electricity infrastructure, and are raising funds to build out fiber connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monica Webb is the chairwoman of the cooperative, called WiredWest. So far this year, 19 of those towns have passed bond measures to fund construction. More than 40% of residents in 14 of those towns have already paid a deposit for service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some might call us a coalition of the desperate," Ms. Webb said. “We're already feeling the negative impacts of not having adequate broadband."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Burke and Mr. Cairns, who passed on the yellow three-bedroom house in May, decided not to make any offers until they see which towns commit to the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After we looked at I think maybe 10 houses we were like, ‘It doesn't really matter. We can't pick a house because we don't know which towns are doing this,' " Ms. Burke said. “The towns that don't pass it we absolutely will rule out. It's not a question."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forward-looking indicator of home sales rose to its highest level in more than nine years in May, a sign the housing market is gaining traction after a shaky start to the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that its index of pending home sales increased 0.9% to a seasonally-adjusted 112.6, the highest level since April 2006. The index tracks contract signings, which usually close within two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The steady pace of solid job creation seen now for over a year has given the housing market a boost this spring," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's index was "a little softer than expectations," wrote Daniel Silver of <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> in a note. "But the trend in the series still looks favorable, with pending sales up for five straight months through May."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the NAR reported a sharp pickup in sales of existing homes after a drop in April. Sales of existing homes soared 5.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.35 million, the highest level since November 2009, a time when government incentives in the wake of the recession boosted the real-estate market. This year's sales have exceeded last year's for eight straight months and stand at 9.2% above last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But existing home sales, which account for about 90% of the market, are still well below their prerecession peak, when they routinely exceeded 6 million and even topped 7 million for part of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have also been rising lately. The median price of an existing home last month was $228,700, or 7.9% higher than in May 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing affordability remains a pressing issue with home-price growth increasing around four times the pace of wages," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales rose 6.3% in the Northeast and 2.2% in the West but fell 0.6% in the Midwest and 0.8% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is kind of slow and steady," said Andrew Carmody, president of the residential division at Crescent Communities, a developer. "We definitely think it's going to be choppy but if you string that together over many months we're optimists that the recovery is continuing to gain momentum."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio may have lost some battles over his affordable-housing agenda in Albany, but the struggle has contributed to a boom in residential construction in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The threatened expiration of the developers' property-tax break known as 421-a triggered a rush to beat the deadline, creating the city's biggest surge in building permits in seven years, according to data compiled by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You are seeing a lot of good come out of it," said Gene Kaufman, an architect, of the rush by developers to meet the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaufman said he shepherded three projects through the city's Department of Buildings in time to meet the deadline. He said city developers had purchased land on the assumption that they would qualify for the tax program, and needed it to make their financial projections work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax abatement expired on June 15, but the state Legislature was expected to renew it for four years with only limited changes. It was designed to spur housing development, but opponents say it costs too much -- more than $1 billion a year in lost tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify under the old rules, developers were required to have approved building plans and to have begun at least some construction on the project before the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for 5,546 apartments and houses were filed in April, the most for any month in at least four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, permit activity rose further: New census data show an additional 12,555 permits were approved by the buildings department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The permits for residential units approved in those two months exceeded the total for all of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first five months of 2015, more permits were issued than in any full year since 2008, when 33,170 permits were issued during the final months of the real-estate boom before the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen G. Kliegerman, president of Halstead Property Development Marketing, said while the market has been strong there was no other change in industry fundamentals to explain the uptick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is mostly a rush for the 421-a deadline," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said many last-minute projects were in traditionally weaker housing markets outside Manhattan, where developers who met the rules had been entitled to the abatement without conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Mr. de Blasio proposed requiring rental developers to set aside up to 30% of a building for affordable housing in exchange for a tax abatement, while eliminating benefits for condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time there was a similar surge in building permits was in 2008, just before tightening of rules in a generous version of the 421-a tax abatement was to take effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June of that year, when the earlier round of benefits expired, permits were issued for 17,128 residential units, more than half the total for the entire year. More permits were issued that year than in any year since the early 1970s. But after the downturn, many of those projects stalled, and some faced foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamie McShane, a spokesman for the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, said the surge in permit activity when 421-a benefits are threatened "proves the importance of the program."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, many of the permits were for residential units in larger projects in Brooklyn and Manhattan. In May, many small projects won permits. Projects in Queens made up 38% of the total, followed by Brooklyn at 37% and Manhattan at 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buildings-department data show that at least 25 projects were scheduled to start work under new building permits on June 15, the day the old 421-a program expired.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Winnebago Industries Inc</span>. posted a bigger-than-expected increase in earnings for its latest quarter, helped by higher revenue from a rise in motor home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motor home revenue rose 7.4%, mostly on 11.4% higher shipping volume while the average selling price for the units fell. Towable revenue, meanwhile, jumped 16%, helped by better volume and shipments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended May 30, Winnebago booked earnings of $11.5 million, or 43 cents a share, up slightly from $11.4 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.6% to $266.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for 41 cents a share on $261 million in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Winnebago, which closed Wednesday at $20.70, have declined 13% in the past 3 months.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing rebound may have lifted home prices across much of the nation. But cities like Lithonia, Ga., are still waiting for the bounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with other communities in the Atlanta area, the small working-class suburb saw prices run up during the housing boom a decade ago, followed by an epic bust. While nearby wealthier areas are now rising, or even fully recovered, poorer towns such as Lithonia are stuck with a housing crisis that drags on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 10,000 homeowners in Lithonia -- or 54% of all families with a mortgage -- owe more than their homes are worth, according to the online real-estate tracker Zillow. That is a stark difference from wealthy Atlanta neighborhoods like Buckhead, where about 12% of homes are underwater. House values in Lithonia at the end of the first quarter were still almost 35% off their peak, while in Buckhead they were off by only 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a disproportionate housing recovery appear across the U.S. <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, about 15% of homes worth less than $200,000 were underwater as of the end of March, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real-estate information firm. Meanwhile, just 6% of homes worth more than $200,000 were underwater during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, homes across the price spectrum are still below their boom-time peaks. Between January 2006 and May of 2015, the median value of homes in the bottom third of the market has dropped 13% to $101,900, according to Zillow. The median in the middle third is down 6% to $172,600, while in the top third it is off 4.5% to $325,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet many middle-class and high-income communities are now seeing home values that are close to those before the crash. Robust activity in some markets has spurred the return of bidding wars for hot properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lithonia illustrates the growing divide in the recovery in the U.S., where large swaths of the housing market -- from Trenton, New Jersey to Memphis, Tenn. -- remain bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places like Lithonia "were hit with foreclosure first, the longest and the hardest," says John O'Callaghan, chief executive of Atlanta Neighborhood Development Partnership Inc., a nonprofit that buys and rehabilitates foreclosed homes. Residents there "don't have good access to mortgage credit," he says. "They don't have wage growth. Everything is going wrong."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today in Lithonia, boarded-up homes with overgrown yards dot the streets surrounding Shirley Jones, who bought her early-1900s home in 1996 for about $80,000. Ms. Jones cashed out some of her home's equity to do repairs in 2005, when her lender said her house was worth $325,000. Now, she owes about $172,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Needing to make more repairs, Ms. Jones a few years ago asked a real-estate agent to assess what the home might be worth. The agent, who is also her friend, said the home wouldn't sell for more than $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Oh my gosh, I almost fainted," recalls Ms. Jones. Her four-bedroom home, which has a neat brick path to the front entrance, is a few doors down from homes with plywood over their windows and overgrown lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It breaks your heart," says Ms. Jones. "Even though I love my home. I look across the street at abandoned properties. You're passing empty homes. It makes the community look dead, like a ghetto."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say lower-income communities have been hit by a confluence of events and factors that have left their communities stuck in a vicious cycle. It starts with falling home values, which trigger foreclosures as homeowners can't sell their property for a price that would cover the outstanding mortgage debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are reluctant to lend to the lower-wealth borrowers with shakier credit histories who would normally buy homes in those neighborhoods. That reduces demand, leading to more foreclosures and a higher supply of vacant and decaying homes -- leading to further price drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cycle has been hard to break in large part because low-wage workers have seen little, if any, income growth during the recovery -- putting them in weak position to qualify for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such woes are putting pressure on the Obama administration and federal agencies to do something to break the cycle. One, albeit controversial possibility: Cut the mortgage balances of some underwater homeowners with loans backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The companies' regulator, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, has said such a move could be ironed out later this year. Housing advocates and some lawmakers argue that while cutting loan balances could cost taxpayers money in the short-term, it saves money in the long-run if it keeps more homeowners current on their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To turn something like this around, it takes a lot of resources and focus," says Julia Gordon, a senior director at the left-leaning <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span> in Washington. "Without help, these neighborhoods might take years and years to come back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mel Watt, a former Congressman from North Carolina who took the helm of FHFA last year, has been more cautious on the issue than advocates expected. He is warning that such a program, if it happens, will be limited. It could only be open to homeowners already in default -- to constrict its size and not incentivize others to deliberately fall behind. It could also target low-balance loans more prevalent in hard-hit communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some skeptics of such plans say any amount of debt forgiveness is too much. "This is a slippery slope," says Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian <span class="companylink">Cato Institute</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's clear is that many of the economic forces that helped trigger recovery in affluent and middle-class communities aren't working in lower-income communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Negative equity preys on the less affluent," says Zillow chief economist Stan Humphries. He said that even underwater homeowners still current on their mortgages suffer, because they often face trouble refinancing to capture a lower interest rate. "It's a double-whammy for them, because they're paying higher than they should on their mortgage costs and they owe more than they would if they could re-buy their home now," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor purchases helped arrest falling prices in the communities stretching east of Memphis by reducing inventory of homes on the market. But some investors have been reluctant to invest in Memphis's poor communities. Those that do tend to turn the homes into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memphis Invest GP, a real-estate investment firm, has purchased nearly 400 homes in the Memphis area in the past 12 months. Since late 2011, the value of homes in Collierville has risen 10% to $267,000, according to Zillow. But in Frayser, where average home values have risen only 5% to $40,000, Memphis Invest GP is absent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did invest in them [during the housing boom] but lost a lot of money on that area," says Chris Clothier, a partner with the firm. "We went through the market and realized that with a lack of good jobs, a lack of access to grocery stores and restaurants, it was a bad bet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poorer communities are more likely to see involvement from nonprofit groups, but their constituents also face constraints. Frayser Community Development Corp., a nonprofit that buys and rehabilitates vacant homes, says it is tough for many would-be buyers to secure financing -- even when the economics seem to make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just scramble to get folks who are paying $650 per month rent and can't get a mortgage that would cost $480 per month," says Frayser executive director Steve Lockwood. "Our demographic still can't qualify for mortgages," he says, citing relatively low credit scores and a lack of down-payment funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in relatively wealthy counties, the lowest-priced communities are suffering. In the town of Ewing, N.J. in Mercer County, the median home value is $176,000 and about 29% of homes are underwater, according to Zillow. In tony Princeton, which is about a 20-minute drive away, the median value is $788,000 and roughly 5% of homes are underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For residents of Ewing, the problems are taking a toll. High-school teacher Adrienne Stanley and her husband moved into a $279,000 Ewing townhouse in 2007, making a 20% down payment, with the idea of starting a family. Soon after buying, prices started to drop but the couple assumed that prices would soon recover as the economy picked up strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, eight years later, prices still aren't even close to prerecession levels. Some nearby townhomes recently sold for between $150,000 and $190,000. Ms. Stanley would like to move to Princeton to get stronger schools for her daughter, but her family is stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I lose sleep every night thinking that my lack of foresight is the reason that she will not get the education I so desperately want for her," says Ms. Stanley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few places have the difficulties of Lithonia, which calls itself "City of Granite," and sits fewer than 10 miles southeast of the dome of Stone Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, Lithonia seemed like a city on the rise. A new shopping mall opened in 2001. In 2006, a home builder started construction on the first new subdivision in the town in years. An Atlanta-based developer proposed constructing an amusement park a short drive away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When home prices started to drop, however, most of those plans were canceled or put on hold. The homes that did get built, originally priced between $170,000 and $220,000, are now worth $150,000 at most, according to Zillow estimates. Construction on a hotel at the mall was stopped after the crash; now trees sprout through the base of the building's shell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many underwater homeowners have stopped investing in their homes, says Dan Immergluck, a Georgia Tech professor who has studied the issue. That has also contributed to the cycle of falling home prices and deteriorating housing stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downward spiral, in sum, is also bad for local business. Home remodeling contractor Raymond Nintiwe in April moved his firm from Lithonia to the more affluent city of Snellville about a 20-minute drive away. Mr. Nintiwe says most of his jobs, which include bathroom and kitchen remodelings, have lately been in northern Atlanta suburbs such as Buckhead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says that many homes in Lithonia are falling apart, and could use the work, but residents have been loath to invest the $20,000 or so needed for a major remodeling. "Kitchen renovations are not a good investment in that part of metro Atlanta," says Mr. Nintiwe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lithonia's main street has many vacant storefronts and the stores that did survive are often only open for part of the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower revenue from property taxes prompted the city to bring in reserve police officers, who don't get paid and work 16 hours a month, rather than full-time police officers, says Lithonia Mayor Deborah Jackson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jackson says that a developer recently began to construct homes in the half-built subdivision after years of the lots remaining dormant. But she is still troubled that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> will allow homes to be sold to third parties at a price below the mortgage balance -- known as a "short sale" -- but won't shoulder the same losses on behalf of the current homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, she raised the issue at a panel on the underwater problem that included FHFA Special Adviser Megan Moore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just trying to figure out if there's a way where we can do a targeted principal reduction program that doesn't put taxpayers at risk and helps borrowers," Ms. Moore had said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Jackson is underwhelmed. Regarding government foreclosure programs, she says, "I don't think enough is being done to help."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>870 words</div><div>24 June 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders got a bigger lift than many expected from this year's spring selling season, with new-home sales rebounding strongly from the industry's lackluster 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 233,000 new homes sold in this year's first five months amount to a 24% increase from the same period a year earlier, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday. March, April and May traditionally are the three biggest months for new-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rebound has been a long time coming. U.S. home construction boomed from roughly 2004 to 2008 amid lax mortgage-qualification standards. It then cratered from 2009 to 2011, hammered by the foreclosure crisis and a scarcity of credit for home builders and buyers alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery since 2011 has been rocky in the short term and frustratingly slow in the long term. Builders still have ground to make up: Even with this spring's surge, the market's pace of sales in May -- 546,000 homes annually, when seasonally adjusted -- amounts to roughly 75% of the average annual pace from 2000 to 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this spring's healthy gain is welcome for many builders after the flat spring of 2014, which was soured by job growth that hadn't yet hit full stride and buyers' resistance to rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a great spring," said Bill Cellar, chief executive of closely held Providence Homes, which sold 109 homes in the first five months of this year in its market of Jacksonville, Fla., up 20% from the same period last year. "That's quite a bit more than we projected to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any pickup in home construction stands to benefit the overall economy, given that construction of single-family homes has been anemic in recent years. Home construction historically has accounted for 5% of U.S. gross domestic product, but it has hovered near 3% for the past year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors have coalesced this year to bolster home sales. Job growth has gained significant momentum, with employers collectively adding more than 200,000 jobs in 14 of the past 15 months. That has created a new population of potential home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders slowly are making more construction loans available, and some mortgages now are slightly less expensive due to recent reductions in the annual fees charged on <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>-backed loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potential source of momentum heralded by builders of late is the nascent return of entry-level buyers, who were sidelined in the recovery by slow job and wage growth and tight mortgage-qualification standards. Multistate builders that recently reported more entry-level sales include <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., which started a division this year to cater to that segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> on Friday reported that 56% of homes it sold in the four months that ended May 31 were purchased by first-time buyers, up from 50% in the previous quarter. KB Home CEO Jeff Mezger called the market's apparent increase in entry-level activity a potential "turning point" for the housing market's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are feeling better, and jobs are being created," said Emile Haddad, CEO of California developer FivePoint Communities Inc. "You're starting to see kids move out of their parents' home. In our markets, it's all about [economic] fundamentals and job growth right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FivePoint, a joint venture of Mr. Haddad and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, has developed communities in the Bay Area and Southern California. In FivePoint's Valencia project in Santa Clarita, Calif., builders sold 265 homes from January to May of this year, up from 231 a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tavistock Development Co.'s Lake Nona community near Orlando, Fla., builders sold 242 homes in this year's first five months, up from 194 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists and builders see new-home sales continuing to improve. But they add that a few factors still could weigh on the market. Interest rates, for example, are expected to rise later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A very slow increase would be OK, and that could take some buyers off the fence" to move ahead with purchases, said John Johnson, CEO of closely held <span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span>, which sold more than 3,000 homes in 12 states last year. "But if [rates] bump up too high, too quickly, that could really slow things down." Weekley Homes' sales so far this year are outpacing the year-ago results by about 10%, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank Securities</span>, posits that new-home sales will gain momentum if builders construct more homes to be completed or near completion when buyers come looking. Many builders have eschewed such speculative construction since the downturn wiped out overextended peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There just needs to be more supply," Mr. LaVorgna said. "I'm of the view that supply creates the demand, that if you build these properties, you will wind up putting people in them."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lisa Beilfuss   </div><div>631 words</div><div>24 June 2015</div><div>12:39</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. on Wednesday said profit rose 33% in its latest quarter, as the continuing recovery in the housing market led to an increase in deliveries and higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares rose 4% in midday trading, adding to the 9% gain notched this year through Tuesday's close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Executive Stuart Miller credited the much better-than-expected results to the improving home-building market, buoyed by a better employment picture, reasonable affordability levels, supply shortages and favorable monthly payment comparisons to rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report this week showed new home sales in May climbed to the highest level in more than seven years[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-to-7-year-high-1435068249?KEYWORDS=may home sales], while building permits jumped 25% from a year earlier—the latest signs the housing market is building steam after years of sluggish progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We're still in the early stages of a multiyear slow but steady housing recovery," and the “spring selling season confirms that the market is continuing to improve at a very consistent pace" Mr. Miller said on a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CEO cited some downsides facing the market, like the regulations surrounding mortgages, the slower-than-expected entrance of first-time buyers and millennials' propensity to rent, but said the downsides are overall “very limited."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Miami-based builder, which has been focused on the higher-end first-time buyer and move-up market, deliveries during the quarter jumped 20% to 5,989 homes, while the average sale price of homes delivered increased 8.1% to $348,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As first-time buyers are more sensitive to price and interest-rate increases, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s President Rick Beckwitt said, “we don't know how much longer we'll be able to nudge prices up," though pricing power is currently strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders, considered an indicator of a builder's future performance, soared 18% to 7,271 homes. Analysts at RBC projected an 8.5% year-over-year increase to 6,709 homes. The average sales price rose 8.1% to $348,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower expenses also contributed to the better-than-expected profit. Selling, general and administrative expenses dropped 21% during the May period, more than the company had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like others in the industry, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> has been ramping up incentives[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/developments/2015/03/12/what-hovnanian-lgi-results-tell-us-about-this-spring/] to drive sales. In the quarter ended in May, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> boosted its average sales incentive by 5.9% to $21,500 for each home it closed on in the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gross margin on home sales contracted to 23.8% from 25.5%, which the company attributed to higher land costs. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> said the increase in the average sales price helped offset that effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief Financial Officer Bruce Gross said <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> is still on track to report a full-year gross margin of 24%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall for the May quarter, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> reported a profit of $183 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $137.7 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue grew 32% to $2.39 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 64 cents in per-share profit on $2 billion in revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial-services revenue, about 8% of the top line, rose more than 50% to $169.9 million, following higher refinance volume and the better backlog conversion. Analysts at Susquehanna said performance in the business contributed about 5 cents to the earnings beat. But with the recent increase in mortgage rates, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> expects some cooling in the refi market during the second half of the year, the CFO said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lennar</span>'s multifamily business, meanwhile, posted another operating loss and profit in its Rialto segment—which buys and sells distressed commercial and residential mortgages—nearly halved.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes surged in May, buoyed in part by the return of younger buyers who had long struggled to find a path into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of existing-home sales rose 5.1% last month from April to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.35 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. Sales for April were revised up to 5.09 million from an initially reported 5.04 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month hit their strongest pace since November 2009. "We're moving back toward a more normal housing market," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts pointed to the return of first-time buyers, who have been cautious for much of the recovery, as evidence the housing market is starting to look more like it did in the early 2000s, before a boom and bust. First-time buyers rose to 32% of all existing-home buyers from 27% a year ago, NAR said. Historically, first-time buyers have made up about 40% of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant growth in home prices and sales is unlikely without new buyers. A stronger market for existing homes can help shape the wider economy in part because homeowners invest in things from washing machines to lawn mowers and use their homes to finance other big purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you take first-time buyers out of the equation then all you're doing is shuffling deck chairs around," Mr. Stanley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dirk Peterson, a 33-year-old civil engineer, and his wife, Samantha, started looking to buy their first home online with brokerage Redfin about six months after moving to the Chicago area. The couple, who are expecting their first child, had moved around the country for his job but wanted to settle near family. With the rental market tightening and mortgage rates still low, it seemed like a good time to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the couple closed on a four-bedroom home in Deer Park, a suburb northwest of Chicago, putting down about 10% of the $488,000 purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't want to do the starter home thing. We wanted to get something that even if it was a little expensive, we'd be happy staying in for the next 30 years," Mr. Peterson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the recovery has been too uneven for economists to feel certain the housing market is on solid ground. Sales unexpectedly fell in April before recovering last month. One issue is a shortage of new and existing inventory that is pushing up prices and driving potential buyers away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Higgins, director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the <span class="companylink">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, sat down with The Wall Street Journal's Dennis Berman to discuss some of the regulatory issues companies are facing. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: Pay-ratio disclosure. It was in Dodd-Frank. Maybe you can remind everyone of the requirement and tell us where we are in actually making this happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: It requires companies to disclose the total compensation of the chief executive officer, the median compensation of their workforce, and the ratio of those two numbers. It's pretty simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: But?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: The biggest concern that we've heard is that the statute requires the median compensation of all employees. And the way the commission proposal expresses that, “all employees" includes the entire workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: Some people wanted you to exclude certain workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: Foreign employees. Look, a lot of people don't think that this disclosure is material or useful information for investors. That it's meant to name and shame. We have heard that. It is the statute, it's the law of the land, and the commission was directed to implement that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the commission came up with a proposal that the best way to read that is the way it naturally sounds, but to provide as much flexibility as we could to allow companies to use statistical sampling and other estimation methods to try to determine the median compensation for a global workforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: So what does that mean?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: You don't have to put all your 240,000 employees into a spreadsheet and ask Excel to find the…</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: That's not that hard. “Sum all," and “Find median."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: The problem—I don't deny these are real concerns—is different payroll systems, different ways of paying people in different countries. Not everybody has sort of a W-2 compensation number like in the U.S. that you can come up with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so companies rightfully said, “Look, we want to get this right. We take our obligations seriously. And if we really are going to do this right, it's going to be very, very expensive for not a lot of benefit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: So a CFO can say, “We're going to take a core sample and dig a few inches, and that will be sufficient."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: But you don't have to find every employee's compensation to get to a median. When you read your newspaper and it talks about the median home price in the U.S., my guess is that they don't take data from every single home sale over a period of time. There's a statistical sampling that gets done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: So what's your advice to the CFO who has to go in front of her board in two weeks and say, “On the agenda is pay-ratio disclosure"?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: The proposal is out there. It's under consideration. We're working up recommendations for the commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My advice would be to bring in the statisticians, the HR people, before you go to the board. And let's figure out a way that we can choose a reasonable methodology that will be as cost-effective as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IFRS vs. GAAP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BERMAN: There is a movement to try to simplify financial reporting around International Financial Reporting Standards. Give us the update.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HIGGINS: What the IFRS—that's Jim Schnurr [U.S. chief accountant] and the office of chief accountant at the SEC—has said recently is three principal things. One is, there does not seem to be any huge cry for adoption of IFRS in the U.S., at least by the filer community. Maybe that's an understatement. There isn't really even a substantial amount of support for an option of filing in IFRS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, we think a single global set of high-quality accounting standards would be in everybody's best interest: investors, companies and the like. There's not yet a path forward on that. I think the idea is to continue to work, <span class="companylink">FASB</span> [<span class="companylink">Financial Accounting Standards Board</span>] and the IFRS to work to harmonize where possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Jim has floated recently the idea that if companies want to present IFRS information in their U.S. filings, and are concerned about them being non-GAAP measures [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the standard widely used in the U.S.], maybe we need to provide some relief to filers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market could be in for a bumpy ride as mortgage rates climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers and sellers heading into the busy summer season have been eyeing mortgage rates wondering how long the good times can last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national housing market has been gaining strength in recent years as prices rose rapidly in many areas. In the first quarter, 51 metro areas posted double-digit percentage price gains, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But economists say that momentum may not outlast higher rates, depending a lot on location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For five years, mortgage rates have hovered around 50-year lows, a situation most economists believe will start to reverse if the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> begins to raise interest rates later this year. Rates on 30-year conventional mortgages averaged 4% for the week ended Thursday, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> doesn't have direct control over mortgage rates or any other long-term rates, which fluctuate based on perceptions about the economy and inflation. But when the central bank raises short-term rates, other rates move accordingly over time. Mortgage rates typically track yields on 10-year Treasury notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates matter for the strength of the housing market because higher rates boost mortgage payments, making homes less affordable. At 3.9%, monthly payments on a 30-year, $400,000 mortgage would be about $1,890. If rates rose one point to 4.9%, payments would rise to $2,100 a month; at 5.9%, payments would be about $2,370 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While modest increases in interest rates are certain to knock some buyers out of the market, many economists believe most home buyers will hang in -- at least for the near term. The reason: The monthly cost of an average-size home remains relatively affordable when compared with average incomes. Apartment rents also have risen sharply in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But higher rates could spell trouble for pricier West Coast cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, where home prices are already out of reach of many residents and would only be made worse if mortgage rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, for example, with mortgage rates at 4%, a typical household would have to spend 41% of its income on mortgage payments to buy a house for the median price in the area, according to Zillow. If rates rise to 5%, that household would need to spend 46% of its income to afford mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, in San Francisco, a typical household would go from spending 43% of its income with mortgage rates at 4%, to spending 48% with rates a percentage point higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, in a cheaper market such as Chicago, a typical household must spend 14% of its income on mortgage payments with rates at 4%, according to Zillow. That would climb to just 17% with rates at 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rule of thumb is that no more than 30% of a household's income should go to housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result for these overpriced markets will be less of a pop and more of a fizzle. Economists expect that prices in those places will mostly likely flatten out or decline slightly, which may help keep the markets from overheating. "It's almost like someone pouring cold water on some of these hot markets to cool them down," said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's senior director of economic research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current mortgage rates, homes in all top 30 metro areas are either undervalued or fairly valued at current prices, according to John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting Inc. Mr. Burns defines fairly valued as in line with historical norms for mortgage payments compared with incomes. If rates rise to 6%, homes in more than half of those markets, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Denver, would be overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm worried about it," said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage. "The rates have been so low for so long that trying to persuade anyone that 4% or 4.5% is still a bargain may not be easy to do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, high rents make it less likely potential buyers will be scared off. Even at higher mortgage rates, families in most cities will be better off buying instead of renting. At mortgage rates of 5%, typical home buyers would need to spend 17% of their income to afford the median-priced home, while right now they need to spend 30% to rent a typical apartment, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1970s, higher mortgage rates have often correlated with boom times for housing because they tend to reflect the fact that the overall economy is doing well, according to David Berson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Nationwide Insurance</span>. Of course, that's true only up to a point. In 1981, when mortgage rates sailed past 17%, it "killed the housing market," Mr. Berson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, mortgage rates surged in June 2013 as investors anticipated that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> would pull back from its bond-buying program. That "taper tantrum" sent rates from around 3.6% in May 2013 to around 4.5% that July. The pace of sales of previously owned homes declined 8% from July to December 2013, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, economists said the economy overall is in better shape to handle increases. But that may not be true everywhere, and homeowners in California should brace for a gradual end to the boom times.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen  </div><div>432 words</div><div>19 June 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the eye-popping luxury-home market, do more "clicks" online translate into faster sales?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To answer the question, Zillow identified about 4,300 homes in the U.S. valued at or above $3 million that sold in the past 12 months, through the end of March. Zillow then ranked those listings in order of page views in their first 30 days on the site. Turns out, lots of looky-loos make little impact on the speed of the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50 luxury listings that got the most traffic in the first month -- a median of 4,218 page views -- spent 133 1/2 days on Zillow before the sale closed. By comparison, the rest of the $3 million-plus homes sold in that period had a measly median of 552 page views. But these properties sold in a median 129 days -- or 4 1/2 days faster than the high-traffic homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So even when luxury listings get lots of clicks, "the ratio of signal to noise is much higher," said Zillow senior economist Skylar Olsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most-viewed luxury home was a 9,500-square-foot modern beach house in Bridgehampton, N.Y., which garnered 11,295 views in its first 30 days and sold for $27.5 million in January. It spent 231 days on Zillow before closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overwhelming majority of top-dollar homes on the list were in California. Ms. Olsen points to two reasons: expensive, competitive housing markets and a large share of mansion-like homes, which Zillow users might be more inclined to browse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the celebrity factor. Dana Roberts, an agent with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> in Irvine, Calif., and a co-agent sold a three-bedroom oceanfront home for $4.85 million in December. Ms. Roberts declined to name the seller, but public records list him as Jonas Hiller, an NHL goaltender with the <span class="companylink">Calgary Flames</span>. Mr. Hiller didn't respond to requests for comment. The home, which got 3,529 page views in its first month, was listed on Zillow for just 73 days; the city's luxury home median is 117 days. Ms. Roberts credits the quick sale to their competitive pricing, news stories that identified the owner, and, to an extent, the curiosity factor -- some neighbors wanted to see how the house had changed after a recent renovation.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>507 words</div><div>17 June 2015</div><div>18:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers have surpassed Canadian snowbirds as the dominant foreign buyers of homes in the U.S., according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchasers from China made up 16% of international buyers who bought primarily single-family homes and condominiums in the 12-month period that ended in March, according to the survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That was up from 12% in 2013. Canadians made up 14% of international buyers, down sharply from 23% in the 2013 survey. In third place were Mexicans who made up 9% of foreign buyers in the recent period, up slightly from 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, Canadians seeking warmer weather—mainly in the American Sunbelt—were the biggest foreign buyers of U.S. homes, which were often purchased as vacation or retirement properties. But Canadian sales have declined recently, in part due to the weak Canadian currency, which raises the cost of dollar-denominated products. Meanwhile, Chinese purchases have picked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese also dominated dollar volume of properties sold. Buyers from China purchased $28.6 billion of properties in the U.S. in the year ending in March 2015. That compares to $11.2 billion of properties that were purchased by Canadians and $7.9 billion by buyers from India. Mexicans were fourth by dollar volume with $4.9 billion of purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers reflect a growing interest by Chinese buyers in plunking their dollars in the relative safe haven of American real estate, where rules around owning property are well defined and the economy is viewed as strong and stable, said Jed Smith, managing director of quantitative research at the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the number of transactions dropped 10% from last year, even though total dollar volume of sales was up 13% to $104 billion, according to the survey. Mr. Smith said the decline in transactions was due largely to currency changes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/strong-dollar-makes-u-s-real-estate-less-attractive-to-foreigners-1431713598?KEYWORDS=us real estate canadians chinese]. Indeed, 75% of Realtors surveyed said that exchange rates are important to foreign buyers, which could pose challenges if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers make up just 4% of existing home sales, but they are important to the market because they tend to spend much more than their local counterparts. Thirty-five percent of Realtors reported working with an international client in 2014. They spent on average $499,600 on a property, compared with the average U.S. home price of $255.600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers spent the most on U.S. homes: $831,800 on average. The average price of home purchased by Canadians was $380,300.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. builders are preparing to ramp up home construction this summer, underscoring Americans' growing demand for housing and potentially propelling the economy to stronger growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreakings fell 11% last month after surging to a seven-year high in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. But the level of activity remained stable in May at an annual rate of 1.04 million units, and signs pointed to further gains in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits to build new homes rose 12% last month to an annual rate of 1.275 million, the highest since August 2007. Permits for apartment construction surged, while permits for single-family homes, a much broader segment, rose modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures offer the latest sign the housing market is slowly gaining momentum as more Americans land jobs and start to see slightly higher wage gains. Meanwhile, a rapid rise in home rents in recent years is making apartment construction more attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's pullback in overall home construction may have been driven in part by weather. Unusually wet weather stymied builders in several states in May, especially those in the central and southern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report on housing starts showed that construction fell in all four regions, with the biggest declines occurring in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for new homes remained strong, builders say, but constant rain in certain states made pouring foundations, framing and roofing all but impossible. DSLD Homes, a closely held builder based in Baton Rouge, La., started construction of 150 homes in May in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. That is roughly flat with DSLD's year-ago tally, and it is a slowdown from the 15% year-over-year gains that the builder logged in March and April. "We had crews idled, and things cost more when you're trying to do them in between rain," DSLD Chief Executive Saun Sullivan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts are still far below historical norms. Even with the latest momentum, groundbreakings are less than half their 2006 peak of 2.27 million homes, annualized. In the late 1990s starts routinely exceeded a 1.5 million pace.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new bidding war is breaking out in real estate. The targets of attention aren't luxury properties or waterfront land, but something far less fashionable: self-storage warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 97,000-square-foot self-storage facility in Orlando, Fla., recently sold for $11.8 million to Westport Properties Inc., a self-storage operator, after a bidding battle among 18 potential purchasers, including several real-estate investment trusts, or REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller, Vista Self Storage Co., received a price of about $121 a square foot, a significant premium over the $100-a-square-foot average sales price commanded by storage properties in the Orlando market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a perfect example of how hot the self-storage market is," said Michael Mele, senior director of the National Self-Storage Group at Marcus &amp; Millichap, which brokered the deal. "I wouldn't consider this an A-quality facility or location, but we cornered over 18 offers," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-storage sector differs from other types of commercial real estate because the market is fragmented, with 80% of the facilities owned by individuals or small investors, Mr. Mele said. While REITs would prefer to buy portfolios, "the reality is that most of the self-storage transactions are single-property deals," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The self-storage industry is benefiting from a number of trends, including a scarcity of new supply coupled with population growth and a strengthening economy, which energize the housing market. A strong economy creates demand for storage by commercial users, while a robust housing market means more people will be moving and storing personal belongings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supply has led to increased occupancy at many properties, which fuels higher rents and attracts the interest of investors eager to lock in stable returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From both an operations and investment perspective, self-storage is an exceptionally good investment," said David Blum, a Coral Springs, Fla.-based consultant to the self-storage industry. "We have not built any new product in a long time, and over the next two years we need another 3,000 facilities to keep up with the shortfall."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also fueling demand for self-storage facilities by investors is the perception that the sector is recession-resistant, with demand for storage strong in both good economic times and bad. According to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>, at the height of the recession and financial crisis in 2008, self-storage REITs delivered a 5.1% total return, which comprises price appreciation and dividends. In comparison, the FTSE Nareit All Equity REIT Index, which tracks all REITs, posted a negative return of 38% that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, self-storage REITs have continued to outperform the broader stock market and other REITs, producing a total return of 31% last year compared with 28% for all equity REITs and 14% for the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Self-storage is the perfect storm of ideal investment qualities," said Jim Berry, managing member of RRB Development LLC in Atlanta, who is developing two Class A self-storage facilities with <span class="companylink">CubeSmart</span>. "It consistently performs, it is resilient to economic turmoil, it has a unique ability to grow rents and thus returns, and it's safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, if interest rates rise, that could affect the returns investors receive, said Mr. Blum, the industry consultant. But many in the sector said there is such a shortage of facilities they don't see oversaturation as being an issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drew Hoeven, president of the real-estate group at Irvine, Calif.-based Westport Properties, which acquired the Vista facility in Orlando, said his company has been developing and acquiring individual properties across the U.S. since 1985 and owns or operates 85. While he said he is bullish on the sector as a whole, he worries about the volume of capital entering the market from institutions and large investors such as REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These investors, he said, are bidding up prices and making it "difficult finding a diamond in the rough." Plus, sellers are more likely to sign with buyers who have a track record in the industry, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are building instead of buying. Jay Massirman, managing partner of Miami City Self Storage LLC, recently closed on the purchase of six parcels and plans to develop one million square feet of state-of-the-art facilities in urban areas in South Florida. He expects to break ground on five buildings in the next 60 days and has an additional 10 development deals in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're bullish on the industry, but we know there's competition impending or that economic changes could take place," he said. "So we're trying to move this business plan as far as we can ahead to accomplish our mission."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Home Builder Confidence Rises to Highest Level in Nine Months; National Association of Home Builders’ index indicates market could be picking up steam after a sluggish first quarter</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kate Davidson   </div><div>524 words</div><div>15 June 2015</div><div>11:52</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence among U.S. home builders in June jumped to its highest level in nine months, a sign the housing market may be picking up steam after a sluggish winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index rose five points to a reading of 59 in June, the industry group said Monday. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a June confidence reading of 56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measures of current and future sales expectations “are at their highest levels since the last quarter of 2005, indicating a growing optimism among builders that housing will continue to strengthen in the months ahead," NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the same time, builders remain sensitive to consumers' ability to buy a new home," Mr. Crowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, based on a survey of builders, showed that the gauge of sales expectations for the next six months climbed six points to 69. The measure of buyer traffic rose five points to 44 and the component for current sales conditions jumped seven points to 65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The short-term relationship between the NAHB and the hard new home sales numbers is very volatile, but the underlying message is clear enough; we should expect a robust housing recovery during the summer and beyond," Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in confidence comes amid other signs that the spring home-selling season is gaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government reported new-home sales rose 6.8%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-climb-6-8-in-april-1432648929?KEYWORDS=New Home Sales\] in April, and construction spending surged to its highest level since November 2008. Last month the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its pending homes sales index[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/pending-home-sales-hit-highest-level-in-nine-years-1432821731?KEYWORDS=Pending home sales], a forward-looking gauge of home purchases, reached a nine-year high in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group is forecasting existing home sales for the full year will reach their highest level since 2006. And home prices are picking up, a sign of rising demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has remained choppy throughout the recovery even when builder confidence has run high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current level of the index is considerably higher than what economists would typically expect given the tepid pace of housing starts, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist for MFR Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There remains a big disconnect between what home builders are saying and what they are actually doing," Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If builders do step up construction to meet perceived demand, that would help create new jobs, increase purchases of materials and boost an economy that slowed in the early months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed builder confidence rose three points in the South to 60, three points in the Northeast to 44 and two points in the West to 57. Confidence fell one point in the Midwest to 54.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In Hong Kong, the Apartments Are Fit for a Mosquito; Much like London and New York, demand from investors is pushing up prices of even tiny apartments</span>
</div><div class="author">By Isabella Steger   </div><div>1056 words</div><div>2 June 2015</div><div>21:31</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—In showing an apartment of 180 square feet, a real-estate agent explained that all furniture essentially has to be made to order and described the window sill as a potential area for “entertainment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, in a development called High Place, isn't much bigger than the standard U.S. parking space. It went into contract in May for almost four million Hong Kong dollars (US$516,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by Hong Kong's cramped standards, apartments here are getting tinier and tinier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So small are some of the new developments in Hong Kong that they have been given the moniker “mosquito-sized units."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incredible shrinking apartments in Hong Kong are part of a broader trend of rising values of residential real estate in major cities around the world, as investors see property as a better investment than low-yielding bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong, much like London and New York, also is seeing strong demand from wealthy investors from other countries looking for safe places to park their money, with much of that investment coming from mainland Chinese buyers. While these investors go after higher-end Hong Kong property, they are helping boost prices in general, making it tougher for people simply looking for a place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong property prices have continued to rise despite repeated attempts by the government to keep them in check. The average price of private residential property, according to government data, has been on an upward trend since 2009, save for dips during three quarters in 2011 and a very mild correction during 2013 after the government stepped up measures to cool property prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such price increases have put strains on buyers in many major cities, but nowhere is the squeeze greater than in Hong Kong. Demographia, a U.S. think tank, in a recent study comparing median incomes with median housing prices, ranked Hong Kong property as the least affordable in the world, with home prices on average 17 times annual income, well above the 10.6 for second-place Vancouver. New York ranked seventh, with a 6.1 ratio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2007, incomes have risen about 42%, but home prices have soared 154%, according to a calculation of data provided by the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People have to sacrifice and crowd into smaller apartments," said Joanne Lee, of real-estate broker and consultancy <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span> in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frustration over the increasing unaffordability of property in Hong Kong was one of the factors that drew tens of thousands of young people into the streets when students staged months of pro-democracy protests last year in the so-called Umbrella Movement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumers have no bargaining power," said Barbara Leung, who teaches real-estate economics at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. “Today if people want to buy property, like a couple who want to build a family, they don't ask what the square footage is. They just ask about the price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a development called Mont Vert by <span class="companylink">Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd</span>., controlled by the city's richest man, Li Ka-shing, apartments even smaller than 180 square feet last year prompted a flood of <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos showing people using arm spans to measure the living area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments were priced from about HK$2 million, about the cheapest way to get on the Hong Kong property ladder, though Cheung Kong only allows buyers who have already bought a larger unit in the development to buy a studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a development targeting first-time buyers, called My Place, <span class="companylink">China Overseas Land &amp; Investment Ltd</span>. and the <span class="companylink">Urban Renewal Authority</span> offer 229-square-foot studios priced around HK$4 million. Studios smaller than 200 square feet at Baker Residences, a joint development by <span class="companylink">Sino Land Co</span>. and the URA, now fetch close to HK$3 million, despite the building's location across from two funeral parlors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a complex called Axis by the same developer as High Place, <span class="companylink">Henderson Land Development Co</span>., 242-square-foot apartments are on offer from HK$5.5 million to HK$6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, the rising values have paid off. Since the start of 2009, the <span class="companylink">Hang Seng</span> Properties Index, which tracks nine property stocks, has risen more than 100%, while the benchmark <span class="companylink">Hang Seng</span> Index has increased 94% in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But young Hong Kongers have to downsize their dreams of home ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jai Shum, a 23-year-old interior-design draftsman, is looking for a place to rent with his girlfriend while they save money to buy an apartment. They considered renting a studio in Mont Vert, but decided it was too expensive. By his calculations, if they save between HK$8,000 and HK$10,000 a month, it would be more than a decade before they can afford a down payment on a HK$4 million apartment. That is because the <span class="companylink">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span> dictates that banks can now lend first-time buyers only 60% of the value of smaller apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Mr. Shum said he will try his luck in the lottery for housing subsidized by the government. About 46% of Hong Kong's population live in such housing, which is highly competitive and open only to those below a set level of income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a subsidized-housing lottery in March, 135,000 people applied for 2,160 apartments, the highest number since the launch of the program in 1978, according to the Housing Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few other low-cost options exist for young Hong Kongers looking for their own place. Traditionally, young people have lived at home until they get married, but Buggle Lau, chief analyst at property agent Midland Realty, said the demand for tiny apartments is also being driven by an increasing number of young people who want to move out while they are still single.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's still better than living in a subdivided flat," said Mr. Lau, referring to a legally gray area: apartments divided into multiple units for rental, each one often smaller than 100 square feet. Tiny studios are often jokingly called “high-end subdivided flats."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a busy week on the economic calendar, and it's far from just jobs. Take today, where April personal income and spending comes in an hour. Muted gains are anticipated there, thought construction spending for the month is seen having rebounded from March's softness. But the day's most-important report may be the manufacturing ISM. Hint of further softness in that sector could further concern that the 1Q soft patch is more than that. <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> futures are up 2.5 as oil eases 1% and gold edges lower. The euro is little changed at $1.0915, and the same goes for the 10-year Treasury yield as it's at 2.13%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON BOMBING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Formal Sentencing for</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tsarnaev Is June 24</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal judge said Thursday he would formally sentence Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury has decided should be executed for his crimes, on June 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jury on May 15 sentenced the 21-year-old to death for his role in the April 2013 attack and aftermath, which left four dead and more than 260 wounded. While U.S. District Judge George O'Toole is bound by the jury's decision, he must still officially impose the sentence in a proceeding that will include statements from victims. Mr. Tsarnaev will also have an opportunity to speak in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jury didn't appear swayed by defense arguments that Mr. Tsarnaev was remorseful for his actions or was heavily influenced by a domineering, jihad-obsessed older brother. The older brother, Tamerlan, died four days after the marathon bombing, at age 26, in a shootout with police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any execution is likely years away, following a lengthy appeals process. The federal government hasn't executed anyone since 2003.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hits Nine-Year High</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home purchases rose for the fourth straight month in April and reached its highest level in nine years -- the latest evidence of firming demand in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its index of pending home sales, which is based on contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, rose 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted level of 112.4 in April from an upwardly revised reading of 108.7 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales would rise 1% in April. Home sales typically close within a couple of months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index rose 14% in April from a year earlier. That was the eighth consecutive year-over-year increase, NAR said. The index is at its highest level since May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Realtors are saying foot traffic remains elevated this spring despite limited -- and in some cases severe -- inventory shortages in many metro areas," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chicago-area man pleaded guilty Thursday to two felony counts for willfully setting on fire and disabling a federal air-traffic control center last September, endangering flight safety and costing airlines millions of dollars in disruptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Howard, an aerospace engineer who had been employed by a <span class="companylink">Federal Aviation Administration</span> contractor for eight years, used gasoline, wire cutters and knives to knock out the <span class="companylink">FAA</span> center in suburban Aurora, Ill., which is responsible for directing high-altitude air traffic over five Midwestern states. The charges carried a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, fines of $500,000 and possible restitution of $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sept. 26 outage, in which Mr. Howard attempted to take his own life, disabled the <span class="companylink">FAA</span> center for more than a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Howard, 37 years old, appeared before U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago. The government is recommending that he serve less than the full 30 years. Mr. Howard is expected to be sentenced Sept. 11.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers on Thursday removed a section of a crude-oil pipeline that ruptured and spilled more than 100,000 gallons of oil off the Santa Barbara County coast last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The piece of pipe will be sent to an independent lab in Ohio to determine what caused it to fail, according to a spokeswoman for the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration, a division of the Transportation Department. The agency ordered and supervised the removal and will station an inspector at the lab to observe the metallurgical testing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pipeline will be shipped in two segments -- one 19 feet long and the other 31 feet long, a PHMSA spokeswoman said, adding that the amount of time it takes to conduct the tests and analysis can vary. She declined to provide details on the condition of the pipe when it was removed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 8.62 points on Thursday. In some editions Friday, an In the Markets article about Thursday's stock trading incorrectly said it fell 8.61 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ May 30, 2015)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks slipped, pulling back one day after the technology-heavy <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite notched a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36.87 points, or 0.2%, to 18126.12. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> declined 2.69, or 0.1%, to 2120.79. The Nasdaq Composite Index sank 8.61, or 0.2%, to 5097.98.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pullback is the latest in a rocky week for stocks, as investors grapple with news out of Greece, a mixed bag of economic data, a wave of new merger announcements and the prospect of the first interest-rate increase by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> in nine years later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said Thursday's decline came on the heels of modest stock-trading volume. Many investors are awaiting further updates on a coming Greek debt payment, as well as the latest reading on first-quarter U.S. economic growth, due Friday, and next week's jobs report for May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People just want resolution before really committing capital, and that seems to be driving everything right now," said Seth Setrakian, co-head of domestic equity at <span class="companylink">First New York Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline by U.S. stocks followed a slide by shares in Europe, where hopes were dashed that Greece was close to reaching a deal with its creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany's DAX index fell 0.8%, while France's CAC-40 shed 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Greece and the Fed are the only two things moving the market right now," said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow is down 0.6% so far this week, after getting battered by its worst selloff of the month on Tuesday. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> has shed 0.3% so far in the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of economic reports were released Thursday morning. Initial jobless claims rose by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 in the most recent week, slightly more than expected. Pending home sales for April rose 3.4% to the highest level in nine years, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, investors will get a second reading on first-quarter gross domestic product. The initial reading of first-quarter growth showed the U.S. economy slowed sharply, growing at a sluggish 0.2%. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect that to be revised downward to a 1% contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are getting the major pieces of the Fed puzzle," said Mark Spellman, portfolio manager of the $81 million Alpine Equity Income Fund. He added that investors are starting to focus on employment and wage inflation data to be released late next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In commodities markets, U.S. oil futures rose 0.3% to $57.68 a barrel following U.S. oil-inventory data from the Energy Department. Gold futures gained 0.2% to $1,188.10 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.132%, from 2.137% late Wednesday. Bond yields fall as prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, shares of <span class="companylink">Avago Technologies</span> rose 89 cents, or 0.6%, to $142.38 after the chip maker agreed to buy rival <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> for $37 billion in cash and stock. <span class="companylink">Broadcom</span> shares eased 91 cents, or 1.6%, to 59.25 after soaring on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</span> shares climbed 2.65, or 13%, to 22.30 after the teen retailer reported a wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter but said it expects to see sales trends improve throughout the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Express gained 79 cents, or 4.8%, after the company said first-quarter profit more than doubled and sales rose by a better-than-expected 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">AMAG Pharmaceuticals</span> rose 1.83, or 2.7%, to 68.52.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European stocks slipped Thursday as a rally spurred by hopes Greece was close to reaching a deal with its creditors petered out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 ended the session down 0.5% at 406.83. Germany's DAX fell 0.8% to 11677.57 and France's CAC 40 dropped 0.9% to 5137.83. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 bucked the trend, edging up 0.1% to 7040.92.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece aims to have an agreement with its international creditors by Sunday, a government spokesman said Thursday. But European officials played down the chances of an imminent deal, saying there was still work to be done before the impasse over the future of Greek finances is resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments suggest "this incredibly protracted showdown still has some way to go," said interest-rate strategists at <span class="companylink">Rabobank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Stoxx Europe 600 had surged after Greece's prime minister said Athens was close to hammering out an agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sentiment in European markets is likely to remain sensitive to each piece of news on the Greek negotiations, said Ian Williams, economist and strategist at brokerage <span class="companylink">Peel Hunt</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greece's benchmark index fell 1.7% Thursday. The two-year Greek bond yield fell by just under half a percentage point to 22.5%, reflecting a rise in the bond price. Still, yields at this level indicate investors are factoring a significant chance of default by Athens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency markets, the euro traded higher against the dollar. Late in New York, the common currency bought $1.0954, up from $1.0904 late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks were slightly lower in the U.S. In late trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 39 points, or 0.2%, at 18123.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> declined two points, or 0.1%, to 2121. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost nine points, or 0.2%, to 5098.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worries about Greece also weighed on U.S. shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading volume has fallen through the week as investors await more news from Greece, said Seth Setrakian, co-head of domestic equity at <span class="companylink">First New York Securities</span>. "People just want resolution before really committing capital, and that seems to be driving everything right now," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks have been whipsawed this week as investors grapple with the news out of Greece and the prospect of the first interest-rate increase by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> in nine years later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic reports have been a mixed bag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Greece and the Fed are the only two things moving the market right now," said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks had staged a rally Wednesday as a surge in technology stocks lifted the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index 1.5% to a record closing high of 5106.59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Dow was down a fraction this week after suffering its worst selloff of the month on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, investors will get a second reading on first-quarter gross domestic product.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home purchases rose for the fourth straight month in April and reached its highest level in nine years—the latest evidence of firming demand in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday its pending home sales index, which is based on contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, increased 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted level of 112.4 in April from an upwardly revised reading of 108.7 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales would rise 1% in April. Home sales typically close within a couple months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index rose 14% in April from a year earlier. That was the eighth consecutive year-over-year increase, NAR said. The index is at its highest level since May 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Realtors are saying foot traffic remains elevated this spring despite limited—and in some cases severe—inventory shortages in many metro areas," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., the owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains were broad-based, with all four major regions of the country seeing increases in pending sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have stabilized since dipping a year ago, when interest rates on mortgages began to rise from near-record lows. Other recent housing data suggest the spring home-selling season is off to a strong start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes climbed 6.8% in April[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-climb-6-8-in-april-1432648929?], to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed existing-home sales fell 3.3% in April[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-decline-3-3-in-april-1432217164] after surging in March, the Realtors said last week. But the March numbers were revised even higher, and NAR said much of the decline was due to a lack of supply rather than decreased demand from buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. home-building rose 20.2%[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-climb-20-2-in-april-1432038806] in April to the highest level since before the recession officially began, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are very wary of calling a serious, sustained upturn [in] the housing market, but most of the omens right now are good," Pantheon Macroeconomics Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited inventories have pushed up prices for existing homes. That has helped close the gap in cost between typically more expensive new homes and previously-owned properties. Still, existing home sales account for about 90% of the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.67% in April, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates are down one-tenth of a percentage point from the previous month and remain low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wednesday's report, pending sales of existing homes in April rose 10.1% in the Northeast, following four straight monthly declines. Pending sales rose 5% in the Midwest, 2.3% in the South and 0.1% in the West.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes rebounded and prices rose briskly in April, signs of rising demand in a housing market constrained by tight supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales climbed 6.8% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The median price of a new home sold in April stood at $297,300, up 8.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate measure of home prices rose for the 35th straight month. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose 4.1% in the 12 months ended in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady job growth, historically low interest rates and rising rental costs have been pushing potential home buyers into the market. But with home prices rising faster than incomes, some buyers may be squeezed out of the market. Supplies of existing homes are tight and home builders have been slow to start construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crosscurrents have been reflected in other recent housing data, which showed a drop in existing-home sales last month alongside stronger price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate firm Zillow, and other economists believe the U.S. needs construction of at least 1.5 million new homes a year to keep pace with a growing population and the normal loss of existing stock due to age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, builders are averaging just more than 1 million starts, not much different from 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Woodside Homes</span>, a closely held builder operating in five western and southern states, sold 453 homes in the first quarter, up 30% from a year earlier. Woodside Chief Executive Joel Shine described spring sales as "reasonably strong" rather than spectacular. He noted that job growth has remained strong and interest rates remain below 4%, with the expectation of an interest-rate increase later this year that would give some buyers additional motivation to buy now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's sort of been the recovery that never has gotten spectacular but doesn't go away either," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, monthly sales of new homes have averaged 515,000, a pace that if continued would mark the best since the first half of 2008. During the past year, new-home purchases are up 26.1%. The market in April had 4.8 months of supply of new homes, reflecting how long it would take to exhaust existing inventory at the April sales pace. That was well short of the 6-month mark many analysts consider a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales reflect about one-tenth of all home purchases. The April figure has a margin for error of plus or minus 15.8%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro fell to a one-month low against the dollar, and European stocks declined, amid doubts over Greece's ability to repay its debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., stocks fell sharply as a mixed bag of data highlighted unease with the pace of economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro dropped to $1.0872 in late New York trade from $1.0978 late Monday, extending the previous day's declines as markets reopened following a long weekend in a number of markets, including the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar's rally was broad, with the buck touching its highest level in nearly eight years against the Japanese yen. The U.S. currency was at 123.05 yen late in New York from 121.56 yen late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said comments Friday from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen that the central bank was on track to raise interest rates this year gave the dollar a boost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are coming back after the holiday and digesting Yellen's comments, and gaining some optimism regarding the dollar. Investors have been looking for something to restart the dollar rally," said Phyllis Papadavid, a currency strategist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 0.7% to 403.61, with no sectors ending higher. Shares of energy and basic-materials companies logged the biggest losses, as metal and oil prices were hurt by the climb in the dollar. A strong dollar makes commodities more costly for holders of other currencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude for July delivery dropped $1.69 a barrel, or 2.8%, to $58.03 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Brent crude fell $1.80 a barrel, or 2.75%, to $63.72.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in commodity stocks weighed on the U.K.'s FTSE 100, which fell 1.2% to 6948.99. Germany's DAX slid 1.6% to 11625.13, and France's CAC 40 fell 0.7% to 5083.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contributing to euro weakness were concerns over whether Greece would have enough money to make payments due to the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> in June. Greek bonds fell as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Uncertainty around Greece has kept the euro on the back foot," said foreign-exchange strategists at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Tuesday that the country would be able to make its next payment on June 5 because it will have reached an agreement with its creditors by then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If any deal is reached then it will be at the 11th hour," said Todd Mattina, chief economist and strategist at Canadian fund manager Mackenzie Investments. "Greece is entering its most serious period yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greek two-year bond yields climbed by as much as 2.8 percentage points to 25%, before retracing slightly. Yields rise as bond prices fall. Yields on Greece's 10-year debt rose 0.4 percentage point to 11.7%. An inverted yield curve, where shorter-term debt yields more than longer-dated bonds, is a sign that investors see a high risk of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German bonds benefited from the unease. Ten-year yields fell 0.05 percentage point to 0.55%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190.48 points, or 1%, to 18041.54. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> index lost 21.86 points, or 1%, to 2104.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 56.61 points, or 1.1%, to 5032.75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop followed a raft of economic data Tuesday -- including a report showing demand for big-ticket manufactured goods in the U.S. in April fell 0.5% from a month earlier. Economists had expected a decline of 0.1%, though business investment showed signs of picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data showed home prices continued to climb in March, but less than expected, while new home sales and consumer confidence rose.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued their unremitting climb in March, underscoring concerns of some economists over whether the strong price gains are sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, covering the entire nation, rose 4.1% in the 12 months ended in March, slightly weaker than a 4.2% increase in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.7% from a year earlier, compared with 4.8% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index gained 5% year-over-year, identical to the increase in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the long stretch of strong reports, it is no surprise that people are asking if we're in a new home-price bubble," said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee for <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. "The only way you can be sure of a bubble is looking back after it's over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 4.9% increase in the 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer said that home prices typically rise 1% a year, compared with the current 4.1% pace. But he noted that the annual rate of increase halved in the past year, suggesting that home-price growth is moderating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would describe this as a rebound in home prices, not a bubble and not a reason to be fearful," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot tech cities continued to see big increases, including San Francisco, where prices rose 10.3%, and Denver, where they increased 10% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite fears that the fall in oil prices would hurt the Texas housing market, Dallas posted 9.3% year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month home prices also saw significant gains, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not seasonally adjusted, the U.S. index rose 0.8% from February to March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index saw a 0.8% month-over-month gain, and the 20-city index saw a 0.9% increase over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonally adjusted, the 10-city index rose 0.9% in March from February and the 20-city index rose 1%. The national index rose 0.1% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth has been moderating across the U.S. in 2015 after large gains in the prior couple of years coming out of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'd say that home values are increasing but the pace of the increase is moderating. They're coming back down to reality," said Svenja Gudell, senior director of economic research at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some economists say they are concerned that prices are continuing to rise out of step with buyers' incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 3.3% in April from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said the lack of supply was driving up prices and damping buyers' enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks tumbled after the latest news about the economy underscored investors' unease with the recent pace of growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 220 points, or 1.2%, to 18012, with all 30 of its components in the red. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> index lost 23 points, or 1.1%, to 2103. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 64 points, or 1.3%, to 5026.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said volume was slightly higher than last week, when stock-trading volumes hit some of their lowest levels of the year, but still below average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A little pullback like this after such a big upside is to be expected," said Bill Nichols, head of U.S. equities at <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline follows a raft of economic data Tuesday -- including an early report showing demand for big-ticket manufactured goods in the U.S. in April fell 0.5% from a month earlier.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data showed home prices continued to climb in March, but less than expected, while new home sales and consumer confidence rose. This week will bring an updated reading on first-quarter gross domestic product, expected to show a 1% decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders also said some selling was spurred by renewed divisions within Greece's government over an upcoming debt payment to the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The macro story of Greece is still out there," said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG. "Greece is an overhang on Europe [that] doesn't appear to have an easy resolution."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks also fell on Friday, pulling back from all-time highs reached early in the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 18232.02, while the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> lost 0.2% to 2126.06.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has always taken some financial wherewithal to purchase a newly built home. But never like now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that the pace of new home sales in April reached an annualized 517,000[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-climb-6-8-in-april-1432648929], adjusting for seasonal swings. Even with the caveat that the sales figures aren't measured well, this counted as good news: It suggested weak sales in March, when annualized sales came to just 484,000, were mostly about the weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while April counted as one of the strongest new-home sales reports since 2008, taking a longer view it was still very weak. In the 1990s, when the population was about one-fifth lower than it is now, an average of 700,000 new homes sold annually. Existing-home sales (that is, sales of previously owned homes) are also depressed[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-decline-3-3-in-april-1432217164], but not nearly as much. Indeed, over the past year, there have been about 12 existing homes sold for every new home sold, compared with about six in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price has a lot to do that. Over the past year, the median price for a new home has averaged $289,750. That is 37% more than the $211,300 price tag an existing home has carried. While the two measures aren't completely comparable, in 1999 the difference was half that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the median price for a new home in 2013 reached 4.2 times the median family's income[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-249.pdf], equaling where it was during the peak of the bubble. Given that new home prices have risen more than income since then, that mark has probably been eclipsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today's high new-home prices aren't about housing froth; they are about who homes are getting built for. With the financing environment still tough, and many homeowners of lesser means opting to stay put rather than trade up to a new home, builders are aiming at the affluent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real sign of a housing recovery may be when they aim a little lower.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many parts of the country, this is a good time to sell a home. That could make it a risky time to buy one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses are selling fast and prices are going up. Sales of existing homes nationwide are expected to reach the highest volume since 2006, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, median sales prices of single-family homes were at least 10% higher than a year prior in 51 metropolitan areas, according to the trade group. That included Charlotte, N.C., up 18%, and Denver, up 17%. Nationwide , median prices rose 7.4%, to $205,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of homes for sale is helping to drive the market higher, experts say, along with a gradually improving economy and a growing concern that a period of historically low interest rates may not last much longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition among buyers can be fierce, and some are aggressively wooing sellers in an attempt to stand out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Corona bid more than the asking price on a 2,100-square-foot townhouse in Atlanta, and she agreed to see the deal through even if the home was appraised for less than the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I guess I'm a risk taker," says Ms. Corona, an insurance executive who is 38 years old. The appraisal came in above the purchase price of $365,000 and she closed on the house this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers should consider what could go wrong in this kind of market. A bidding war could entice you to spend more than you can afford. An inflated price could leave you owing more than you can sell the house for down the road, if prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some strategies could limit the danger. Study whether prices in your city are being driven by low inventory, which could be a warning sign, or a solid economy, which could sustain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set a budget and stick to it. And see if new homes may hit your local market soon, which could cool things down. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that in April construction on new homes rose to the highest level since before the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that it could still be a good time to buy. Mortgage rates remain near historic lows and home prices could keep rising. Buyers should also factor in how long they plan to keep a home, because short-term volatility may not matter for a long-term owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a buyer's guide to navigating a seller's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House-hunting can be difficult when homes for sale are hard to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a market balanced between buyers and sellers, there are enough existing homes available to satisfy demand for six to seven months, according to the Realtors association. But in the first quarter, the association says, there was only 4.6 months' worth of inventory available nationwide on average, down from 4.9 months in the same period of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings have grown scarcer in many cities. In Seattle, there were 8,465 homes listed for sale in April, down 23% from a year earlier, according to Redfin, a national brokerage based in Seattle. In Portland, Ore., there were 8,941 listings, down 27%. In Omaha, Neb., there were 4,158 listings, down 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners who bought at the top of the market are reluctant to sell because the value of their home plummeted in the financial crisis and still hasn't fully recovered. Others are holding out for higher prices, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the cause, a shortage of listings can have a significant impact on prices even in an otherwise listless market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a March report, <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> , a credit-rating firm, said that prices in many metropolitan areas are being driven up more by limited inventory than by a strong economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With supply limited, small increases in demand can have outsized impacts on prices," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That puts a premium on taking the pulse of your local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Try to determine if the local economy is strong. If jobs are growing, incomes are rising and people are moving into town, that could be a sign that price increases are sustainable or that more houses will soon come onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for signs of new construction in the neighborhood. The number of lots that have been prepared for home building increased more than 21% over the 12 months through March, says Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy, a research and consulting firm that tracks the home-building industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department says the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts increased 9.2% nationwide in April from a year earlier, and the rate of housing units authorized by building permits rose 6.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth varies by region. In the Northeast, for example, housing starts increased 52% from a year ago and building permits increased 57%. In the South, the increases were 3.5% and 1.3%, respectively. In the Midwest, starts declined 10.5% and building permits declined 7.5%. In the West, starts rose 15% and permits rose 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department provides data on building permits for many metropolitan areas. Other sources track local data on housing starts. According to Metrostudy, housing starts of single-family detached homes were up about 15% in Denver and Atlanta in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year, for example. In Las Vegas, they are up more than 36%, says Metrostudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask experts in your market what they are seeing. If construction activity is strong, you should be able to find evidence without too much trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If new homes are going up, patience could pay off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Langan and his partner put their five-month house search in Atlanta on hold in April after the couple grew tired of looking at houses that cost more than they wanted to spend and more than they thought the homes were worth, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I see a lot of people going toward one thing -- this mass frenzy -- I like to step back and evaluate it," says Mr. Langan, 31, a sales consultant for a food distributor. He says they plan to rent for two years, by which point he expects the market to be calmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who push ahead could get lured into bidding wars, where winning in the short term can later feel like losing if you pay too much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars were more common in the first quarter than they were a year earlier in several markets, including Denver, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Oakland, Calif.; Philadelphia; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle, according to Redfin, which bases its figures on the number of bids submitted by its agents that face at least one competing offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other markets saw fewer bidding wars over the same period, including Atlanta; Baltimore; Chicago; Orange County, Calif.; and Washington, D.C., according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers often need to move quickly, which can add to the frenzy. In Denver, Houston, Oakland and Seattle, more than 40% of the homes for sale in the first quarter were in contract within two weeks, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, buyers should figure out how much they can afford to spend ahead of time. Consider getting a preapproval from the mortgage lender you select.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean you should borrow the full amount for which you are preapproved. Be sure the monthly mortgage payments will leave enough left over for living expenses and emergency funds. Think about how you would cover the cost if you were temporarily unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you set a budget, stick to it. Be prepared to walk away if prices get too high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider looking at houses that aren't selling as quickly. The owners may be more willing to lower the asking price. But get a thorough inspection to make sure you aren't buying a house with serious flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver these days, a house that hasn't been snapped up within two to four weeks is likely either to be overpriced or to need fixing up, says Tim Davis , owner and managing broker at Weichert Realtors Professionals in Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who are eager to purchase a home are also waiving rights that are standard in sales contracts, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to promising to plow ahead even if an appraisal values the house below the purchase price, buyers are agreeing to forego the option of dropping out if an inspection shows the need for costly repairs or if they are unable to get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing strategies and situations that have never been experienced here, and I've been in the real-estate business since 1987," says Mr. Davis, the Denver broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These kinds of contingency clauses, as they are known, are meant to protect buyers. If you agree to drop them, you could end up forfeiting your deposit if you back out. The seller could also sue the buyer, though that is uncommon in a seller's market, says Bob Lattas, a real-estate attorney in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other risks, too. If an appraisal comes in low, buyers could have to put up fresh cash in a hurry in order to go through with the deal. That's because lenders typically reduce the loan amount if a house is appraised at less than the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If, for example, a buyer agrees to pay $400,000 for a house, but the appraised value is $380,000, the buyer could have to pay the seller an additional $20,000 out of pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such situations, buyers essentially acknowledge that they're overpaying. They believe "the house will increase in value so much that even if something is wrong with it [they] will still be fine," says Doug Miller, a real-estate attorney and executive director of Consumer Advocates in American Real Estate, a nonprofit based in Navarre, Minn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk is that prices don't continue to go up -- or, even worse, drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless buyers are certain they can assume the risks, they may be better off avoiding situations where they have to drop contingency clauses in order to strike a deal, says Richard Vetstein, a real-estate attorney in Framingham, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do decide to waive contingency clauses, try to determine how nasty the financial surprise might be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that price and value aren't the same thing. Carole Short, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span> in Atlanta, says some agents are agreeing to list homes at high prices in order to win the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says, "We are starting to see some greedy-seller overpriced listings at numbers where you go, 'Oh my God, are you kidding? That house isn't worth that.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's Driving Home Prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are house prices being pushed up by scant supply or strong demand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a question that could matter a great deal to many would-be home buyers. One answer comes from <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> , a credit-rating firm, which recently looked at 50 large metropolitan areas where prices have risen the most from their low point within the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 17 of those places, price increases are mainly being driven by limited inventory, according to data Fitch provided to The Wall Street Journal. The firm based its conclusions on home-price data through the fourth quarter of 2014 and on economic data such as jobs and construction through the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, for example, prices were up 52% from their low in January 2012, but 54% of the outstanding mortgages in a representative pool had an amount due that was greater than the value of the home as of the fourth quarter. That makes it harder to sell these homes and therefore reduces potential inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there were 5% fewer people employed in Las Vegas than in 2007 and new construction was running 56% below the average since 1973, according to Fitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami and Phoenix were among the other places where limited inventory was the main factor behind rising prices, according to Fitch's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, Fitch found that demand was driving prices in 22 metropolitan areas where the economy looked stronger by the same measures, including Houston, where prices were up 43% from the low in February 2011, and Seattle, where prices were up 32% from the low in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In places where low inventory is pushing up prices, an influx of listings could limit increases or spark a pullback, says Stefan Hilts, a director with Fitch's U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, "the price levels we are seeing today are a little bit artificial," says Mr. Hilts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinking of Buying a Home Abroad?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong dollar is making buying a house abroad more affordable than it used to be for many Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other complications could make buyers appreciate the comforts of home, experts say. Make sure you research the market that interests you carefully before buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U.S. buyers searching for homes abroad has risen about 30% over the past year or so, according to data from Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, based on inquiries received through its network of more than 500 real-estate brokerage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional destinations such as Canada and Europe remain popular, experts say. The U.S. dollar has gained 12% against the Canadian dollar and 23% against the euro over the past year, through Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also have fallen in some places. On the Costa Brava, a coastal region in Spain, houses with a pool and a sea view that currently sell for about 500,000 euros to 600,000 euros (about $550,000 to $667,000) are 40% less expensive than they were in 2007, says Francois Carriere Pastor, chief executive at Coldwell Banker Spain. Prices fell due to the financial crisis and the credit crunch, he says. Spain's economy is troubled by high unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Puglia, Italy, on the Adriatic Sea, the price of one three-bedroom house recently fell from 225,000 euros to 150,000 euros (about $167,000), says Steenie Harvey, Europe editor at InternationalLiving.com, which provides information to Americans looking to buy abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who require a mortgage may have to make a larger down payment than in the U.S. and may have to pay the loan back faster. In addition, fixed-rate mortgages can be hard to come by in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Caribbean, for example, minimum down payments often range from 30% to 40% and loans generally need to be repaid in 15 to 25 years, rather than 30 years, as is often the case in the U.S., says Anita Ashton, managing director at Caribbean Mortgage Services, a mortgage broker based in St. James, Barbados.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, lenders in the Caribbean typically assume that applicants with credit cards carry balances equal to 5% of their spending limits, even if they pay off their cards in full each month, she says. A larger debt load can shrink the size of the mortgage you might qualify for. You also will generally need to provide three years of tax returns, she says, rather than the standard two in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can generally deduct mortgage interest payments on a second home abroad as long as the combined balance of the mortgages on your first and second homes doesn't exceed $1.1 million. This is true even for a vacation home abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are other wrinkles. If the home is in your own name and you aren't renting it out, the house doesn't need to be disclosed to the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> as a foreign financial asset, says David Lifson , an accountant with <span class="companylink">Crowe Horwath LLP</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are renting it out, however, you need to report the income to the <span class="companylink">IRS</span> , and the lease could be considered a foreign financial asset, Mr. Lifson says. And if the house is held by an entity such as a corporation, it needs to be reported as a foreign financial asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask a local real-estate agent about other taxes and costs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars were more common in the first quarter than they were a year earlier in several markets, including Denver, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Oakland, Calif.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle, Wash., according to Redfin, which bases its figures on the number of bids submitted by its agents that face at least one competing offer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless buyers are certain they can assume the risks, they may be better off avoiding situations where they have to drop contingency clauses in order to strike a deal, says Richard Vetstein, a real-estate attorney in Framingham, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do decide to waive contingency clauses, try to determine how nasty the financial surprise might be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that price and value aren't the same thing. Carole Short, a real-estate agent with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span> in Atlanta, says some agents are agreeing to list homes at high prices in order to win the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says, “We are starting to see some greedy-seller overpriced listings at numbers where you go, ‘Oh my God, are you kidding? That house isn't worth that.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes fell in April after surging the previous month, highlighting the fits and starts that have been a hallmark of the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined 3.3% last month from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. March sales were revised to a 5.21 million rate from an initially reported 5.19 million pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said Thursday's report was disappointing but not necessarily a reflection of weakening demand. "If demand was rolling over, we believe that this would show up in a softening of the price data. However, we have seen a pickup in the pace of resale prices to 10% on a year-over-year basis for single-family homes," said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists for RDQ Economics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, also noted that existing home sales aren't recorded until contract closing. Thus, "the April reading is still possibly reflective of purchases that were agreed to in February and March, when weather was still an issue," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun blamed the sales decline on a lack of supply, which in turn is driving up prices. In April, 40% of properties sold at or above their asking price, suggesting bidding wars are becoming common in many parts of the country, Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to exhaust the supply of homes on the market, NAR said Thursday. Total housing inventory at the end of April increased 10%, to 2.21 million existing homes available for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a previously owned homes rose 8.9% from a year earlier to $219,400 in April, the biggest increase since January 2004, NAR said. That price is just shy of the peak reached in 2006, when the median sale price for the year was $221,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in April were up 6.1% from the same month a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Tatyana Shumsky   </div><div>875 words</div><div>22 May 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices are on the upswing -- and a possible rebound in U.S. home building may keep them high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A government report on Tuesday showed U.S. new-home construction jumped 20.2% in April, to the highest level since November 2007. The report is the first good news for housing, which accounts for about 40% of U.S. lumber demand, following several months of lukewarm data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing surge, the biggest monthly gain in percentage terms since February 1991, is likely to extend a recent rise in lumber prices, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber futures fell to a three-year low last week but since then have rebounded 15% to settle Thursday at $269.60 per 1,000 board feet, a standard measure of volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turnaround started as traders who had sold futures, betting on a price decline, bought contracts to lock in their gains. The rally accelerated after this week's construction data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some investors are betting that prices will rise further if the U.S. housing industry gets back into the swing and if China, which accounts for about 20% of U.S. lumber exports, sees demand pick up as authorities move to spur economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All those [U.S. housing] projects that would've gotten done over the winter but got delayed will get done, in addition to everything else that's scheduled," said Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors, a commodities brokerage and investment company in Boynton Beach, Fla. Mr. Hackett said he would buy lumber futures if prices end the week above $260, a move he believes will herald a sustained rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in the lumber market are the latest to be whipsawed by the struggle between two forces acting around the globe: stubbornly sluggish economic growth and expansive central-bank stimulus aimed at jump-starting business activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates remain near record lows, making housing cheap by historical norms in many U.S. regions. But even with unemployment falling to a recent low of 5.4% in April, many consumers remain strapped following years of stagnant wages and are worried about the economy, limiting demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many countries facing anemic consumer demand and sluggish output, authorities are responding by cutting interest rates and buying bonds to ease financial conditions and support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has reduced rates three times in the last six months amid signs that economic activity was slumping. Chinese housing starts fell 17% in the first four months of the year to 358 million square meters, while property sales fell 2.2% in the January-to-April period from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in China's property market pushed North American lumber exports down to 1.015 million cubic meters between September and February, compared with 4.678 million cubic meters a year earlier. Analysts had forecast 5 million cubic meters. The poor demand from China meant more suppliers sought to sell their lumber in the U.S. instead, pushing prices lower early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese lumber demand is likely to pick up in the coming months as lower borrowing costs revive home construction, analysts and investors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect to see higher exports [of North American lumber to China], which means some of that supply will be taken away," said Paul Jannke, a principal with consulting firm Forest Economic Advisors LLC, in Westford, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., a sustained rebound in home construction and strength in employment will spur a recovery in lumber prices, predicted Hamish Smith, commodities economist with Capital Economics. He pointed to building permits, an early indicator of construction activity, which held steady even as housing starts were weak earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He forecast that prices will hit $360 per 1,000 board feet by year-end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the lumber market isn't for everyone. Last week, the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span>, the nation's largest pension fund, put up for sale roughly 300,000 acres of timberland, or about a fifth of its U.S. timber holdings. <span class="companylink">Calpers</span> is making the move after its forestland holdings lost 0.4% over the past five years, its weakest-performing asset since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lumber futures market is also relatively small, with about $195 million of contracts outstanding. According to the <span class="companylink">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</span>, as of May 12, there were just 18 speculative traders betting on lumber futures falling and five betting on prices rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in lumber prices won't be welcomed by home builders, which count lumber as 19% of their typical costs. Home builders use 2-by-4 lumber boards, known as studs, for house frames, floors and walls, as well as to make frames for poured concrete floors and foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Michael Mancini, vice president of purchasing at <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>., which builds homes in Sunbelt states from Florida to California, the drop in lumber prices was a boon. The frosty winter didn't reach most of the markets Meritage operates in, so building work continued while lumber prices across the U.S. declined, Mr. Mancini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were able to take advantage of slightly lower prices this past quarter," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home building surged in April to the highest level since before the recession officially began, a sign of a thaw in the housing market during the crucial spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 20.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.135 million in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the highest reading since November 2007, and the biggest percentage increase since February 1991. New applications for building permits, a bellwether for construction in coming months, increased 10.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures are volatile and often revised, and housing data have been mixed over the past several months. But economists have been cautiously optimistic despite the uneven readings and many said Tuesday's report offered reassurance the housing market is rebounding after a dismal first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is hard to know where the underlying trends in the starts and permits data are because of the recent big changes in the data," <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients. "But today's report is a step in a favorable direction following some downbeat reports on residential construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased activity was broad-based. Starts on single-family units, which exclude apartments and represent almost two-thirds of the market, climbed 16.7%, the most since January 2008. Multifamily units, including apartments and condominiums, rose 27.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's report showed new-home construction rose 4.9% in March from the prior month, compared with an initially reported 2% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists now expect economic output shrunk by as much as 1% in the first quarter, and hopes for a spring rebound had been fading amid a string of sluggish data in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following Tuesday's housing-starts report, however, some forecasters increased their estimates for second-quarter economic output. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> boosted its estimate for gross domestic product to a 2.7% growth rate, from 2.6%. Economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> also raised their estimate to 2.7%, from 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April housing starts in the Northeast, the region hardest hit by snowstorms this winter, increased 85.9%, after doubling in March. Housing starts in the Midwest climbed 27.8%, and home building in the West increased 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a year earlier, housing starts were up 9.2% in April while permits rose 6.4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economies of Sale</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales this year are expected to hit levels unseen since 2006, driven by strong job growth, low interest rates and a gradual loosening of lending standards, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the organization's chief economist, said in his midyear forecast that he expects home sales of about 5.3 million in 2015, a significant pickup from 4.9 million in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, economists also anticipated robust growth in home sales, but a spike in interest rates early in the year and poor wage growth damped the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said that early results this year point to an increase in home sales, foot traffic at homes on the market and strong job growth. Buyers who have been kept out of the market by low wages and strict lending standards are likely to start coming back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is sizable pent-up demand," he said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the volume of sales Mr. Yun is anticipating remains well below the high in 2005, when more than seven million homes were sold across the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said the market is likely a decade off from hitting those levels again. In 2006, sales fell to 6.5 million. Since then, the level has hovered at about five million sales or fewer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If interest rates or prices rise, making houses less affordable, that could hold back the volume of sales, which Mr. Yun said shows the need for more new-home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Dietz, vice president of tax and market analysis at the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, said he anticipates that 2015 will be the first time during the recovery that the growth of single-family home starts will exceed apartment starts. That would be a significant shift for a recovery that has been driven by a boom in rental construction, thanks largely to a declining homeownership rate. Single-family home construction has been far less robust in its growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Dietz said, new-home construction will remain about half of normal production levels. Home builders are being held back by the shortage of construction laborers, the difficulty of obtaining construction loans and the elusiveness of first-time home buyers, he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in a gauge of U.S. housing activities on Tuesday brightened the economic outlook and pushed down prices of ultrasafe Treasury bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh corporate bond sales added to selling pressure in Treasurys, extending the market's price loss into a second consecutive session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was 2.262%, compared with 2.228% on Monday. Bond prices fall as their yields rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government debt in the U.S. had strengthened earlier, along with a broad rally in European government bonds. A senior <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> official said the central bank would ramp up bond purchases this month and next to cope with thinner liquidity during the summer time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments from ECB board member Benoît Coeuré reminded investors that the central bank remains a big buyer in the bond market, which may keep a lid on the rise in bond yields that had jumped sharply from record lows over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., housing starts jumped by 20.2% in April, the biggest percentage increase last month since February 1991 and a positive sign for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of reports earlier this month, such as retail sales and industrial production, had been disappointing, which raised some question about how robustly the U.S. economy is rebounding after a soft patch in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the economy is the key to the decision about when the Fed raises short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006. A rise in the Fed's policy rate would shrink the value of outstanding bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors expect the Fed to wait until very late this year to tighten policy or possibly stand pat until early 2016. But some traders say the Fed could raise rates sooner than investors expect if growth momentum gains traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If the data begins to turn up, it would put the Fed in play for September," which would send bond yields higher, said Thomas Roth, executive director in the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond trading group at <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Securities</span> (USA) Inc. in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> is scheduled on Wednesday to release minutes of its policy meeting in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed-funds futures, used by investors and traders to place bets on central bank policy, on Tuesday showed investors and traders see a 24% likelihood of a rate increase at the September meeting, according to data from the <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>. Those odds were 20% a day ago. The odds of a rate increase for the December meeting were 58%, compared with 52% a day ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic have taken a beating over the past few weeks, after a strong run-up in prices. Growing concern about lofty valuations has caused a rush out of bonds. <span class="companylink">The ECB</span>'s bond-buying program had sent eurozone bond yields to record lows last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors see the move as a buying opportunity, as they don't expect bond yields to rise significantly given the still uncertain growth outlook and subdued inflation. Buyers have stepped into the Treasury debt market, pushing down the 10-year Treasury yield after it hit 2.366% on May 12, the highest level since Nov. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB's Mr. Coeure expressed some concern about the speed of the bond-market selloff over the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">German government</span> bond fell to 0.617% from 0.651% Monday. The yield closed at a record low of 0.073% on April 20.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property market is improving at the margins, though there still is an anvil-size problem around the economy's neck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official government data out Monday showed nationwide property prices falling in April, albeit more slowly than before. The trend is toward a leveling out and possibly a rebound in prices. In China's four so-called tier-one cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen -- prices actually are rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government efforts to revive the market seem to be having an effect. These include lower down-payment requirements on mortgages and removal of curbs on speculators. A stabilizing property market should provide financial-system relief. Bank loan books are stuffed with real-estate collateral; a sustained price drop could wreak havoc on balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question: Will the return of good times in big cities spread to the hinterlands? Here the evidence is more troubling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> working paper examined property data from local housing bureaus, which are based on all buildings that have obtained sales permits. The central-government data depends on property developers' self-reported sales figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While both data sets move in the same direction, the central-government data show a nationwide inventory-to-sales ratio of four months. The local data put the figure at as high as 24 months in the middle of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most serious inventory problems are in a handful of provinces in the northeast. Inventory-to-sales ratios there were over 40 months in 2013, the most recent data available. That compares with less than 12 months in China's richest cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to dismiss these areas as being unimportant. Together, the provinces Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Shandong make up nearly one-quarter of China's gross domestic product. One could suppose pain in Shandong will stay in Shandong. That is possible if banks are insulated enough to not act as transmission mechanisms as they did in the U.S. housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is still a large swath of China that looks to be weighed down by a glum property scene for some time. Rising prices in places like Beijing and Shanghai don't make for a national housing recovery.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeffrey Sparshott   </div><div>552 words</div><div>18 May 2015</div><div>16:23</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Confidence among U.S. home builders fell for the fourth time in five months, a sign the housing market may be slow to pick up after an up-and-down winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index fell two points[https://www.nahb.org/en/news-and-publications/Press-Releases/2015/may/builder-confidence-falls-two-points-in-may.aspx] to 54 in May, the industry group said Monday. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a May confidence reading of 58.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the index is still in positive territory, “the recent softening in sentiment suggests that we are not seeing significant improvement in home-building activity in the spring following the unusually harsh winter weather early on this year," Daniel Silver, economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest fall, the home builder's group said the second quarter of the year is shaping up as solid. A measure of future sales expectations has been tracking up in recent months, mortgage rates remain low and house prices appear affordable. “These factors should spur the release of pent-up demand moving forward," NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, American households have been reluctant spenders this year, according to separate reports out in recent days. <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span> retail sales barely budged in April and confidence is flagging in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumers are exhibiting caution and want to be on more stable financial footing before purchasing a home," Mr. Crowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report, based on a survey of builders, showed that the gauge of sales expectations for the next six months rose one point to 64, its highest level since December. A measure of buyer traffic dropped one point to 39 and the component for current sales conditions decreased two points to 59.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dip in confidence comes amid other signs that the spring home-selling season had been gaining momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its pending home sales index[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-march-pending-home-sales-index-rises-for-third-straight-month-1430316029?KEYWORDS=Pending home sales], a forward-looking gauge of home purchases, rose in March for the third straight month. The Realtors group is forecasting existing home sales for the full year will reach the highest level since 2006. Home prices are picking up, a sign of rising demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And economists expect housing starts to climb more than 9% to an annual pace of 1.01 million in April when the Commerce Department releases the latest data on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expect the housing market to experience a moderate, albeit choppy, recovery this year and think the NAHB report is consistent with that view," said Blerina Uruçi, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If builders do step up construction to meet rising demand, that would help create new jobs, increase purchases of materials and stoke an economy that slowed markedly in the first quarter of the year[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-gdp-expands-at-0-2-pace-in-first-quarter-1430310699].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed builder confidence rose one point in the West to 56, held steady in the South at 59 and in the Northeast at 43, and fell four points in the Midwest to 51.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak Data Doesn't Deter Builders</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't the sort of spring thaw for residential construction that economists expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in March rose a lot less than forecast to 926,000 units, confounding predictions of a sharp rebound from a frigid winter in much of the country. The figure for April, due out on Tuesday, finally should crack the million-unit mark on that annualized, seasonally adjusted basis -- around the average for all of 2014 -- if a Wall Street Journal poll is accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite tepid data so far this year on starts and construction permits, home builders themselves have been upbeat. The April reading of the NAHB/<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Housing Market Index, a measure of builder optimism covering both forward and backward-looking factors, was released around the same time as the weak starts figure. It rose to 56 and Monday's reading, for May, is seen rising to 58.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good bit of that optimism wasn't based on what was happening at the time but instead on the strength of the spring and summer selling seasons. For example, April's survey reading for buyer traffic was markedly weaker than for the period November through January. Sentiment about current sales was slightly lower too. The survey's strongest component was for expectations over the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there certainly won't be more blizzards in July, storms of the financial variety are brewing. Anticipating an interest-rate increase as early as this summer, mortgage rates rose sharply in just the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that rates near historical lows in recent years haven't been enough to spur housing starts back to anywhere near historical norms, the impact of pricier loans is hard to predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts averaged nearly two million annually during the bubble years of 2004 through 2006. But even the decade before that saw over 1.5 million units started annually, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply and demand, not to mention demographics, would seem to make a big increase in home construction a no-brainer. The same argument could have been made a year or two ago, though. While the latent demand may be there, the price still has to be right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders may be in for a rude surprise if rising rates raise the affordability bar too high for some of the new customers they have been expecting.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strengthening dollar is putting the haven of U.S. homeownership out of reach for some foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of finding bargains in a down real-estate market, some purchasers from abroad now face sharply higher housing prices because their nations' currencies have fallen against the dollar. That could reshape certain U.S. housing markets where foreign buyers have been a stabilizing force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreign buyers have been a big part of the rebound in home prices in the U.S.," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at real-estate website Zillow. "The recent strength of the U.S. dollar has significant implications for the attractiveness of the market for foreign buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. real-estate values are up about 5% in dollar terms from a year earlier, according to Zillow, representing a leveling off of growth after stronger gains in 2012 and 2013. But users of many foreign currencies see a dramatically different story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a Russian investor using rubles, for example, the price of Miami real estate was twice as high in February as it was a year earlier, according to Zillow data. A resident of the eurozone buying in New York City faced a 24% price increase during that time, and a Canadian now has to pay 20% more to buy a vacation home in the Phoenix area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Canadian snowbirds are having a harder time finding easy bargains in sun-splashed locales, some real-estate agents say wealthy South Americans and Chinese are still seeking to secure U.S. properties as safe places to store wealth. Agents say that perception has only been reinforced by the dollar's recent rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian buyers, who are a relatively short flight from U.S. vacation hotspots, are of particular importance to the domestic housing market. In 2014, they accounted for 19% of all international transactions, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That figure is down from 23% in 2011, when the Canadian dollar's exchange rate was more favorable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Terracciano, owner of the Re/Max Consultants agency in Palm Desert, Calif., said western Canadians represent the bulk of his clients for seasonal vacation properties. That segment of his business is down 30% from a year ago, he said. The drop-off is even larger among properties priced at $1 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're just not willing to lose a quarter-million on the currency conversion," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar dynamic is playing out in the Phoenix area, another popular destination for Canadians. Those buyers took advantage of depressed home prices in the wake of the recession, at a time when the Canadian dollar was relatively strong and high oil prices provided extra disposable income in crude-rich regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2011, Canadians accounted for 5% of all home sales in the Phoenix area, according to the W.P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>. That represented a larger fraction of buyers than from any single state other than Arizona. In March of this year, Canadians accounted for just 1% of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some Arizona retirement communities, Canadians made a quarter of all purchases from 2008 through 2012, said Mike Orr, director of the university's Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They softened the blow when the market was at its worst, but they're probably putting a damper on growth now that the market has recovered," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas, however, wealthy investors see opportunity in the appreciating dollar and relatively steady U.S. economy. "Affluent buyers are acting like American purchasers did when interest rates first moved up," said Aaron Drucker, a Redfin real-estate broker in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drucker said he frequently shows South American and European investors around high-rise properties featuring ocean views, luxury spas, helipads and nearly nonexistent neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency rates have less influence on Chinese buyers because the yuan closely tracks the dollar. But escalating real-estate values, especially in California, and the dollar's strength against other currencies make U.S. investments attractive for Chinese buyers, said Li Li Hwang, an agent in Rancho Cucamonga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Chinese buyers, the "stronger dollar will indicate that the U.S. is the most safe country" for investors concerned about a slowing economy at home, Ms. Hwang said. "It will give them much more confidence and protection."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're just not willing to lose a quarter-million on the currency conversion," he said. Instead, some of the Canadian clients he cultivated on a 2012 trip to British Columbia are now seeking to sell so they can profit from the currency moves, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his clients, Billy Harasymchuk of Victoria, B.C., recently put his Palm Desert vacation home he purchased five years ago on the market, hoping the stronger U.S. dollar will let him maximize his return. The U.S. dollar had appreciated 20% against the Canadian dollar by mid-March from July 2014, though the Canadian dollar has strengthened a bit in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harasymchuk, 55, said he faces a tough market in part because Canadians who vacation in the area are reluctant to buy. “It's a good opportunity for a U.S. buyer to get a good deal," he said. “But from a Canadian point of view, they wouldn't even bother."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar dynamic is playing out in the Phoenix area, another popular destination for Canadians. Those buyers took advantage of depressed home prices in the wake of the recession, at a time when the Canadian dollar was relatively strong and high oil prices provided extra disposable income in crude-rich regions around Edmonton and Calgary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2011, Canadians accounted for 5% of all home sales in the Phoenix area, according to the W.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Affluent buyers are acting like American purchasers did when interest rates first moved up," said Aaron Drucker, a Redfin real-estate broker in Miami. “They think the dollar's increase is going to continue, and they want to act on it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. dollar has strengthened relative to most foreign currencies over the past year. The gain reflects the rosier prospects for the U.S. compared to many overseas economies. And actions by some foreign central bankers have decreased the value of their currency relative to the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drucker said he frequently shows South American and European investors around high-rise properties featuring ocean views, luxury spas, helipads and nearly non-existent neighbors. While the condominium units are used for the occasional vacation, most buyers view them as containers to store wealth and leave them empty most of the year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currency rates have less influence on Chinese buyers because the yuan closely tracks the dollar. But escalating real-estate values, especially in California, and the dollar's strength against other currencies make U.S. investments attractive for Chinese buyers, said Li Li Hwang, an agent with Century 21 Beachside in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. She frequently works with Chinese buyers and actively advertises that she is bilingual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Chinese clients recently closed on a property during a one-week visit to Southern California, Ms. Hwang said. Purchasers are often seeking property to improve their chances to obtain a U.S. visa or as housing for children attending a local university.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of metropolitan areas that saw double-digit percentage increases in home prices more than doubled during the first quarter, reflecting a mix of thin supply and strong demand that points to heated competition for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty-one metro areas posted year-over-year double-digit price increases, compared with 24 metro areas in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 37 in the first quarter a year ago, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The double-digit gains were widespread -- from an 11% bump in Columbus, Ohio, to a 13% jump in Raleigh-Cary, N.C. -- indicating more than just a handful of hot markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is crazy right now," said Lisa Hitchcock, a real-estate agent in the Sherman-Denison area of northern Texas, which saw a 33% surge in first-quarter home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she has more than 20 properties currently under contract. "I'm just trying to keep my head above water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accelerating gains are a welcome sign for the spring selling season -- a crucial period for sales because families typically want to lock in to a school district by the end of summer -- and an early indication that the moderating gains of the past few years might be picking up. But affordability concerns could keep many would-be buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median sale price of an existing, previously owned single-family home was $205,200 in the first quarter, up 7.4% from a year ago, according to the NAR report. Median prices rose in 148 out of 174 metropolitan statistical areas tracked by the group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the first quarter, the supply of homes for sale was enough to last just 4.6 months, down from 4.9 months a year ago. Economists generally see a supply of six to seven months as representing a healthy balance of supply between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Winston-Salem, N.C., where prices are up more than 15%, broker Eric Munger said clients are becoming discouraged by the lack of inventory. He said one client recently decided to renew his lease for six months because he couldn't find a house to match his criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're encouraging them to make the move anyway if they can find a home that doesn't meet all their criteria but [meets] most of it. They can make improvements and changes that make it more of a right fit for them," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtor group's chief economist, said the current supply shortage could pose long-term challenges. "Sales could soften slightly in some of these markets seeing sharp price appreciation unless housing supply markedly improves and tempers its unhealthy level of growth," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists believe the shortage of supply will begin to prompt builders to respond, particularly with homes targeted to people of more moderate income levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I expect home builders to ramp it up, particularly at the lower price points," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, a unit of <span class="companylink">Moody's Corp</span>. "They've been pretty aggressive at building high-end housing, but they will and they are beginning to build more low- and mid-priced inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home construction is up significantly from the trough to 648,000 new homes built in 2014, up from 2011, when builders broke ground on just 431,000 single-family homes. That is still about half of typical new-home construction levels and well below the 2005 peak of 1.7 million homes a year, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders disagree that a lack of new construction is the sole factor for an unbalanced housing market. They blame relatively weak demand because of a relatively sluggish job market, young people putting off homeownership and people hesitating to put their homes on the market because they still can't get prices to match what they paid during the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Crowe, chief economist for the NAHB, said that in some cases people simply can't sell their homes and buy a new one because their unemployed or underemployed children can't move out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's much harder to sell your house if you can't kick your kids out," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Hamill, chief executive of Oakwood Homes, a Denver-based home builder, said he has ramped up construction significantly in response to a shortage of inventory. In 2015, Mr. Hamill expects to complete 1,200 homes, up from 843 last year. During the depths of the downturn, his company built just over 200 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Hamill said it will likely take several more years before builders have the capacity to fully meet demand. "We lost a lot of builders, lost a lot of trade contractors, we lost a lot of people to other industries," he said of the lingering impact of the 2007-09 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Hitchcock, the real-estate agent in northern Texas, is turning her focus to a growing buyer group: retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, retirees drove demand in warmer states in the southern and western parts of the country, such as Port St. Lucie, Fla., where prices shot up nearly 23%, and the Charlotte, N.C., area, where prices were up by 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sherman-Denison, a quiet area on Lake Texoma near the Oklahoma border, Ms. Hitchcock said she saw a surge of interest from retirees in January, when the real-estate market is typically sleepy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To better serve the retiree market, she said she is taking two courses specializing in selling real estate to seniors, as new subdivisions are popping up on rural land to help meet demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are wanting to retire here because it's a slower pace of life," said Ms. Hitchcock, who showed eight properties on Monday afternoon alone.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese Property Isn't Very Grand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property, the soft underbelly of China's economy, may be looking a little less soft. But judging by developer China Evergrande's stock price, investors may have fooled themselves into thinking another boom is at hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese property market has perked up of late, responding to a slew of government measures to boost demand, such as the lifting of buying restrictions and easing of mortgage standards. With prices nationally down 5% from last year, home hunters are smelling bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a month-on-month basis, prices have stopped falling nationally, with the biggest cities showing rebounds. Transaction volumes picked up over the May 1 holiday weekend, a key buying period, according to Jinsong Du of <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. That has spurred the S&amp;P China Property Index of stocks to a 30% gain over the past month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As good as this news is for averting a broader economic meltdown, it doesn't mean Chinese property will return to the good old days. An ample supply of unsold units remains to be soaked up, which will weigh on developers for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet shares in Evergrande, one of the biggest developers, are at a record, up nearly 100% in the past month. That is despite the company's owning a bloated eight years' worth of land supply to eat through based on last year's pace of sales, says <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. Rival <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>'s has a manageable 3.6-year supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known for wandering into nonproperty businesses such as plastic surgery and dairy, Evergrande last month started offering money-back guarantees on apartment sales, essentially giving buyers an out before closing. The gambit may be working to boost sales, but is risky should buyers get cold feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evergrande remains among China's most leveraged developers. Overall, its net debt to equity, counting perpetual securities as debt, was a dangerous 292%, according to Nomura -- compared with 7% for Vanke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evergrande now trades at 14 times next year's earnings, a premium to Vanke's nine times. Partly, Evergrande is benefiting from a perception that Beijing will do whatever it takes to prop up the real-estate industry, even its most indebted players.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evergrande, more than its peers, has caught lightning from the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect. It has been one of the biggest recipients of mainland funds in recent days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These flows are hardly durable. With Evergrande skyrocketing, at least China bears have something new to consider.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Renault-Nissan</span> Team Needs Strong Ties</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The French government has knocked the <span class="companylink">Renault-Nissan</span> alliance off balance. Righting that could mean taking inspiration from <span class="companylink">International Consolidated Airlines Group</span>, the parent company of <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> and Iberia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Renault SA</span> last month lost a bid to stick with a one-share, one-vote system for its investors. The government temporarily increased its stake in the French auto maker and voted against its proposal. That ensured the introduction of double-voting rights for long-term shareholders, including itself, under a 2014 law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's move struck at a sore point within the lucrative alliance with Japan's <span class="companylink">Nissan Motor Co</span>., which holds a 15% stake in Renault but no voting rights under a separate French law. In an alliance originally crafted in 1999 to prop up <span class="companylink">Nissan</span>, the Japanese auto maker now looks the stronger partner: <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> last year sold about 60% of the alliance's total 8.47 million unit sales and contributed 80% of Renault's group net income. It seems likely Renault will need to address its lopsided relationship with <span class="companylink">Nissan</span>: The French auto maker has a 43.4% voting stake in its Japanese partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diluting the government's ownership and holding another ballot on double voting next year sounds fraught and wouldn't address <span class="companylink">Nissan</span>'s lack of votes in any case. Reducing Renault's holding in <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> below the 40% threshold deemed to confer control would, under French law, be one way to allow <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> voting rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an overhaul is required to address the alliance's fundamental issue, not just the symptoms. Renault and <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> behave more like one company than two but don't have a corporate structure reflecting that. They share a chief executive in Carlos Ghosn, the key architect of the alliance. They build cars on common technological platforms. Executives oversee areas such as production, development purchasing and human resources at both companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One worry for investors is whether each company gets a fair deal, particularly in areas such as cost allocation, product launches and marketing. Renault this year will introduce budget cars to India, helped by using <span class="companylink">Nissan</span>'s existing infrastructure. <span class="companylink">Nissan</span> aims to expand in Europe, Renault's core market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tricky but more sustainable option would be a merger within a holding company, like IAG. Its subsidiaries, <span class="companylink">British Airways</span> and Iberia, run autonomously with their own brands, management and operations. But both carriers benefit from scale in areas such as purchasing, while a cleaner corporate structure should help lessen potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making Renault's and <span class="companylink">Nissan</span>'s ties official should help maintain Mr. Ghosn's vision for the pair beyond his time in charge, due to end in 2018. Political influence and French job security would, doubtless, be a point for debate. But given the importance of the alliance to the French auto maker, strengthening and sustaining the partnership should be in everyone's best interests.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't Dote On BofA CEO Vote</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you can't give shareholders what they want, sometimes you have to pay them heed. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s board will give shareholders a vote on its decision to combine the chief executive and chairman's roles with Brian Moynihan. While welcome from a corporate-governance perspective, it may highlight the stock's lackluster performance of late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board announced Mr. Moynihan's elevation to the chairman's spot last October, a headier time for BofA's stock. At that point, the shares had risen 11% over the prior six months. That was well above the 3% gain during that time seen by the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> and rival <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also was hope that BofA soon could start to close its valuation gap with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. At the time, BofA's multiple of price to tangible book value was only around half that of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past six months have been far less impressive than the board might have been hoping, though. BofA's shares trade slightly below their Oct. 1, 2014, level. And the valuation gap has persisted; BofA's multiple still is only about half that of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In light of that, it is no wonder BofA may now feel it has to be a bit more responsive to shareholder concerns about combining the two positions. But in doing so, it may give investors reason for pause. A decision to combine or split the chairman and chief executive roles should reflect a deeper strategy about how best to govern the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's reversal of its previous stance -- that it alone should decide this -- risks creating the impression it regards the chairmanship as little more than an executive bonus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the board's move isn't likely to inspire investor confidence. Without that, BofA's shares will have a tough time catching up.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeffrey Sparshott   </div><div>506 words</div><div>4 May 2015</div><div>16:32</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks in the U.S. are cutting credit lines to energy companies and forcing firms to cough up more collateral to guard against fallout from the past year's plunge in oil prices[http://blogs.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2015/04/30/oil-majors-see-earnings-plunge-on-oil-prices/?KEYWORDS=Oil prices], a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks expect more delinquencies and charge-offs from the sector over the course of this year, “but they indicated that their exposures were small, and that they were undertaking a number of actions to mitigate the risk of loan losses," senior loan officers at commercial banks told the Fed in a survey tracking changes in loan terms and standards in the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. oil and gas companies went deep into debt during the energy boom as they looked to cash in on new technologies that allowed sizable increases in domestic energy production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those loans looked like a good bet while U.S. oil prices were around $100 a barrel. But after peaking in June, oil prices tumbled, dropping below $50 earlier this year. Prices have rebounded in recent weeks, but remain below $60. The sharp reversal on prices has rattled the energy sector, forcing firms to cut spending, shed workers and conserve cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of banks making loans to such firms, most said they accounted for less than 10% of outstanding commercial and industrial loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the financial sector is taking steps to protect itself, “including restructuring outstanding loans, reducing the size of existing credit lines, requiring additional collateral, tightening underwriting policies on new loans or lines of credit, and enforcing material adverse change clauses or other covenants," the Fed survey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond energy, commercial and industrial loan standards were little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the real-estate sector, though, standards appear to be easing slightly, potentially aiding home builders and would-be homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Banks reported having eased lending standards for a number of categories of residential mortgage loans over the past three months on net," the survey said. Demand for mortgages and home-equity lines of credit rose in the first three months of the year, suggesting more activity among homeowners and home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose to the highest level in 18 months[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/existing-home-sales-up-6-1-in-march-nar-1429711475?KEYWORDS=existing home sales] in March, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last month, a sign the housing market is gaining strength. But U.S. home building has gotten off to a slow start this year. Government data show that in the first quarter of the year, housing starts are averaging only 969,000 a month[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-starts-up-2-in-march-1429187637?KEYWORDS=Housing starts march], compared with just over 1 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial-real-estate lending standards also have eased, and, in addition, a few large banks indicated they had relaxed standards on construction and land development loans. Among the reasons for softening standards were more-aggressive competition from other lenders and an improving outlook for commercial property vacancy rates, the survey said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>814 words</div><div>1 May 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improving economy has enabled more millennials -- those born between 1980 and 1999 -- to qualify for mortgages. And in some markets, they're seeking jumbo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates and loosening credit qualifications are, in part, fueling the change. Borrowers can now pay as little as 3% down for government-backed loans, and 10% or 15% down for jumbos, which are loans over $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,500 in high-price areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slightly more than one-third (36%) of renters aged 18 to 34 said they expect to buy a home within the next year, according to a renters' housing-confidence survey released by real-estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. Nearly two-thirds of young adults said they think that owning a home is necessary to live "the good life" and the "American dream." The findings, released in September, were based on more than 10,000 interviews across 20 different metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally renters expressed plans to buy this year in metro areas where home values are lower, while they planned to wait at least five years in high-price areas, says Skylar Olsen, senior economist at Zillow. An exception was San Francisco, where the current median home price is $715,800 -- well into jumbo territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High rents in the Bay Area -- the median is $3,088 a month -- may be spurring millennials to buy, Ms. Olsen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's booming technology sector is also enabling millennials to apply and qualify for jumbo mortgages, says Mathew Carson, a broker at San Francisco-based First Capital Group. Here, many young borrowers liquidate stock options to make down payments, he adds. "For them, money is easy, and their earning potential is very good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennial borrowers also shop for loans differently, prompting some lenders to expand online and mobile capacities. This first generation that grew up with computers and the Internet are digital natives and expect online lending, says Jason van den Brand, co-founder and CEO of Lenda, a San Francisco-based online-only lender. Lenda currently underwrites refinance loans only; using its website, potential borrowers can complete the application online -- without a loan officer acting as a middleman. The company plans to expand to loans for home purchases within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At age 34, a millennial himself, Mr. van den Brand says he founded Lenda in response to his frustration with traditional mortgage lending that involves face-to-face meetings and what he considers high commissions and administrative fees. "I shop with Amazon Prime and it's on my doorstep in two days," he says. "I want the same experience with my home loan."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Lenda's average borrower is age 41, down from age 45 a year ago, and more than 20% of users of the refinance tool are millennials, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quicken Loans, the second-largest retail mortgage lender in the U.S., is also improving its mobile mortgage tools to integrate the entire process from origination through servicing, says Bob Walters, chief economist for Quicken Loans. "We're now hearing from a lot of clients, especially millennials, 'Why do I have to talk to you?'" Mr. Walters says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with previous generations, the leading edge of millennials has had a slow start at homeownership. First-time home buyers accounted for only 29% of pending home sales in February, compared with a 40% historical norm, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession, high unemployment rates and student-loan debt have been barriers toward homeownership for millennials, says Mr. Walters. "The cost of college tuition has gone up dramatically, and students today have taken on more debt than in past generations," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are other considerations for millennial borrowers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Budgeting for a mortgage. Millennials may need to consider cutting back on dining and entertainment, or other lifestyle expenses, to save for a down payment or afford monthly payments, Zillow's Ms. Olsen says. "Affordability in many ways is a personal question," she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Help from Mom and Dad. Young home buyers often close the down-payment gap by turning to their baby-boomer parents, Ms. Olsen says. By now, parents have likely paid down their mortgages, and with home values on the rise in many areas, they have plenty of equity to dig into to help their children if they choose, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- First-time borrower rules. When a borrower has no history of making payments, many lenders may cap mortgages at $1 million. They'll also look closer at assets and reserves -- especially if monthly mortgage payments are substantially higher than rent, Mr. Carson says. "Lenders like to see strong compensating factors," he adds.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Number of $100 Million Homes Surges in U.S. Ten properties are listed at or above that price, up from three last year</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto   </div><div>729 words</div><div>30 April 2015</div><div>12:11</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, a Russian billionaire became the first person known to pay the unheard-of price of $100 million for a single-family home in the U.S. While breaking the nine-digit mark is still extremely rare, it is becoming slightly less so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March 31, 10 properties are listed in the U.S. at that price or higher—in diverse locales ranging from the Florida Keys to Dallas, according to a report released Thursday by <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>. If they all sell at or above the $100 million mark, it will more than triple the number of such sales in 2014, when three homes sold at above that price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tiny slice at the top of the market is driven by forces largely distinct from the larger housing market underneath it: the increasing concentration of global wealth; the desire for a safe place to put capital; and the notoriety and bragging rights that come with owning one of a handful of the most expensive properties in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are unique assets that only a handful of people in the world can own and they like to be able to say that they own them, not in an overtly public or garish way but to their friends," said Dan Conn, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Christie's International</span> Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three 2014 sales of $100 million or more capture the range of properties that make up the elite category: A duplex penthouse atop the new condo building One57 in New York City; a 11.2-acre vacation property in the Hamptons area of Long Island, N.Y.; and a 50-acre waterfront estate in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Ogilvy, president of David Ogilvy &amp; Associates, who sold the Greenwich property, said the maximum imaginable price for unique properties has moved dramatically upward in recent years. “I listed and sold a beautiful property for $45 million 10 years ago and everybody just fell over dead. I thought that was my career signature," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in 2013 he originally listed the Greenwich property for $190 million. He toured a number of billionaires, including from China and Europe, through the home but couldn't get anyone to bite at that price. In early 2014 the house sold for $120 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said it is difficult to compare the performance of the ultraluxury market to housing overall because the former can swell markedly with just a few dramatic sales. World-wide, luxury home sales—as defined by those over the $1 million mark—jumped 16% in 2014 from the prior year, according to <span class="companylink">Christie's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still in many cities, the pace at which the luxury market is growing slowed in 2014 from 2013. In San Francisco, which had a 62% increase in $1 million-plus sales in 2013, such sales grew 19% in 2014, according to <span class="companylink">Christie's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, New York City and London, luxury sales growth slowed to near zero, which the report attributes to lack of inventory. In many places, the top end of the market is being driven by a few high-profile new condo buildings and can swing based on when those projects are finished and sales close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, million-dollar-plus sales account for 6% of overall residential sales but 41% of the dollar volume. One could purchase 88 average homes for the top sale price of $28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The bar [on price] is being raised every single day," said Nelson Gonzalez, a senior vice president at EWM Realty International in Miami Beach. Still, Mr. Gonzalez said that Florida developers are wary of crossing the $50 million threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to measure the depth of demand for units above $50 million and $100 million because it virtually didn't exist a few years ago. Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers, said that in the past many properties were listed at record-breaking prices and fell flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of the vanity listings that were above $100 million never sold. They either came off the market or the prices were cut in half and then they sold," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>715 words</div><div>29 April 2015</div><div>21:14</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through a long, narrow passageway, behind the green door at 131½ Charles St. in the West Village, lies not the Hogwarts Express, but a secret world nonetheless, a house behind a house, where Diane Arbus, the photographer of eccentric and marginal people, once lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a former stable, hidden from the street behind a small but remarkably well-preserved red-brick Federal-style house, with twin Greek columns, a peaked roof and dormer windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The front house (131 Charles St.), built in 1834 by stone mason David Chrystie as a working-class dwelling, is among the best surviving examples of such houses in Manhattan from this period, according to the city's <span class="companylink">Landmarks Preservation Commission</span>. It's hardly working class now: The property, including the back house, is on the market asking $13.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 23-foot-deep backyard house is one of dozens of such hidden homes surviving in rear yards in the Village. Some were originally workshops, servants' quarters, stores, or in several cases outhouses, said Andrew Berman, president of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Arbus moved into 131½ in 1959, shortly after she separated from her husband, Allan Arbus, and lived there until about 1968, according to a research note by Billy Parrott, a managing librarian at the Mid-Manhattan Library's art and picture collections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a period when she did some of her best-known work, like the “Child With Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park" and the eerie “Identical Twins, Roselle, New Jersey," he said. She won two Guggenheim Fellowships while living at 131½ and had her first exhibition at <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The back house where Ms. Arbus lived is accessed through the green door, and through a 32-foot tunnel—a narrow horse walk where a groom would lead a horse to a rear yard and the stable. The former stable, built in 1889 on the site of an earlier stable, still bears signs of a hayloft door upstairs, and a wooden beam that was used to lift the hay. On the second floor, up a flight of Mahogany stairs, there are now two bedrooms and an 11-foot-high open living room, dining room and kitchen, with exposed beams. By April 1968, when current owner Judith Stonehill and her late husband John bought both the front and back house for $116,000, Ms. Arbus had already moved out. She committed suicide in 1971.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought the house from Thomas B. Morgan, the writer, press secretary to Mayor John V. Lindsay, and future editor of the Village Voice. He emptied the back house at the request of another would-be buyer, who eventually backed out, Ms. Stonehill said. At the time of the sale 47 years ago, the West Village was a still dicey and faded industrial area, with a stirring of gentrification as artists moved in. The streets were dark and the area cut off from the Hudson River by the then-elevated West Side highway. The Stonehills' car was once set afire, police told them, by members of local Irish gang, the 11th Street gang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the West Village is among the most expensive areas in the city. Wendy Gleason, Ms. Stonehill's broker at Halstead Property, said the $13.5 million asking price is comparable to the small number of single-family homes on the market in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The front house has unusual features, such as ancient wood-plank floors, huge, deep storage closets fitted over the low-ceilinged horse walk, a storage attic, and a root cellar under the rear patio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has a graceful high-ceilinged living room, now sparsely furnished with Mies van der Rohe chairs and couch. Other rooms are filled with shelves of antique wooden planes, collected by Mr. Stonehill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspired, in part, by her historic house, Ms. Stonehill became active in preservation, and wrote or edited several books and guides to New York. She was co-owner of the New York Bound Bookshop in Rockefeller Center, which specialized in books about the city. It closed in 1997.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski   </div><div>406 words</div><div>29 April 2015</div><div>13:06</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to buying real estate, are people more interested in being “green" or in saving green?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study in the Appraisal Journal, a trade-association publication, suggests many house hunters could be more concerned with the latter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at roughly 66,000 home sales in the San Antonio area between October 2008 and September 2013, a team led by University of Texas at San Antonio professor Thomas Thomson examined the relationship between a home's “green" features and its selling price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers found that houses classified by the multiple listing service as having a “green" designation such as LEED certification enjoyed a modest 0.7% boost in sales price compared with comparable homes without such a certification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes advertising a specific feature designated in MLS as “green," like a low-flow toilet or an enhanced air-filtration system, meanwhile, saw a 1.7% price increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest price bump, though, was reserved for homes listed as having “energy efficient" features such as high-efficiency HVAC systems or dual pane windows. Houses with these amenities sold for 5.8% more than comparable homes without them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings, Prof. Thomson says, suggest that while environmental concerns influence home buying decisions to an extent, at the end of the day people are most interested in features that will impact their bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That does appear to be the strongest component," he says. “Which makes sense, because while some people might be motivated by environmental reasons, pretty much everybody can be motivated by saving money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Thomson notes, as well, that certain “energy efficient" features offer advantages beyond savings on gas and electricity bills. For instance, efficient HVAC systems also tend to be more comfortable in that they maintain a steady inside temperature with less dramatic heating and cooling cycles. Better insulation and double-pane windows not only reduce energy costs, but make a home quieter, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results may vary with region. For instance, the study identified some water conservation features as highly valued, a finding Prof. Thomson says could reflect the specific demands of the San Antonio market from which the data was collected. He added that buyers in milder climates with lower utility bills might put less of a premium on “energy efficient" as opposed to “green" features.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home purchases rose for the third straight month in March, a sign of firming demand in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday its pending home sales index, which is based on contract signings for purchases of previously owned homes, increased 1.1% to a seasonally adjusted level of 108.6 in March from an upwardly revised reading of 107.4 in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales would rise 1% in March. Home sales typically close within a couple months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index rose 11.1% in March from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said the jump in sales from a year earlier is good news, but “the increased number of traditional buyers who appear to be replacing investors paying in cash is even better news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It indicates this year's activity is being driven by more long-term homeowners," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., the owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have stabilized since dipping a year ago, when interest rates on mortgages began to rise from near-record lows. Other recent housing data suggest the spring home-selling season is off to a strong start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Completed existing-home sales increased 6.1% in March, the Realtors said last week. The jump in March sales followed two lackluster months amid bad winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of newly built single-family homes declined in March from February—the strongest month for sales in seven years—they increased nearly 20% from the sales pace of March 2014, the Commerce Department said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited inventories have pushed up prices for existing homes. That has helped close the gap in cost between typically more expensive new homes and previously-owned properties. Still, existing home sales account for about 90% of the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.77% in March, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates inched up from the previous month, but are down from a year earlier and remain low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Wednesday's report, pending sales of existing homes rose in the South and the West last month, but fell in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Anika and Grant Spears began looking for a bigger house late last year, when they learned they were expecting their third child. But the real-estate market in Sydney was soaring, and they couldn't compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After Christmas, we saw prices go through the roof," said Ms. Spears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They appealed to their bank, which agreed to lend them 1.5 million Australian dollars (US$1.2 million) for a two-bedroom semidetached beach house with a narrow backyard in Sydney's eastern suburbs. The Spears put no money down on the house, which they plan to expand by adding a second floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were very lucky," said Ms. Spears. The 37-year old isn't concerned that mortgage repayments threaten to eat up around 62% of their household income during the nine months she plans to be on maternity leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australian households have among the highest debt levels in the world, according to data from <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. As of December, their debt had risen to 194% of annual income, the highest in Australia since at least 1960, as far back as the <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> data goes, and even higher than the U.S. peak of 135% just before the global financial crisis in 2007. Household debt in the U.S. stood at 107% of annual income in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That debt burden, combined with a slowing economy and rising unemployment, has led economists and the central bank to worry about households borrowing heavily to buy homes whose prices have soared. They are concerned a housing-market correction could derail already fragile consumer confidence and dent spending at a time where the economy is struggling to adjust at the end of a long mining boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Australia's leverage is in uncharted territory," said Kieran Davies, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> in Sydney. “Households never deleveraged like in the U.S. after the financial crisis." He expects debt levels to rise further because interest rates have fallen. That would make homeowners, and lenders, more vulnerable, Mr. Davies said—especially if unemployment increases, as the central bank predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia sidestepped the global financial crisis because of the strength of its mining industry. But the collapse of commodity prices has hit the economy, driving unemployment to 6.1% from 4.0% in 2008 and leading the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span> to cut interest rates to a record-low 2.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture isn't all gloomy. The country's banking sector remains among the sturdiest in the world, and bad debt as a percentage of all loans has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 20 years, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. But credit-ratings firms, including Fitch, expect default rates to increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Spears were given their 100% mortgage because their current home and an investment property they bought a decade ago have doubled in value. “I know that house prices could fall if interest rates start going up, but we have an equity buffer to fall back on," Ms. Spears said. The architect and her husband, a construction manager, hope to sell one of their properties next year at a A$700,000 profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower interest rates have led banks to aggressively market their loans. At the same time, many Australians have snapped up investment properties either for their higher yields or as a bet on rising prices. Official data showed almost 40% of home loans approved in February went to investors, compared with around 31% in early 2009, when interest rates had fallen because of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in the U.S., where loans to consumers with low credit scores helped trigger the turmoil, the investors driving debt to record levels in Australia are mostly wealthy, though that wealth is largely based on the value of their real-estate holdings. Research published by the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank</span> in March found the wealthiest 40% of society owed about three-quarters of household debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For every $1 of debt held by Australian households today, they have almost $6 of assets," said Steven Münchenberg, chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Australian Bankers' Association</span>, an industry body representing the lenders. He said that households on average are 21 months ahead on their mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, regulators are getting increasingly concerned as the housing boom, which had been limited primarily to Sydney, the nation's biggest city, spread to other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Sydney have increased by nearly 39% just since June 2012, according to property data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> RP Data. But even in Wollongong, a steel town about an hour to the south, the median house costs roughly eight times annual median household income. By that measure, Wollongong is more expensive than New York City, according to a recent study by Demographia, a U.S. think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel Suarez, a 41-year old mechanical engineer, felt lucky three years ago when he found a two-bedroom apartment in an unremarkable building overlooking a highway noise barrier in Wollongong's northern suburbs for A$236,000. “It's really impossible to buy something in Sydney," he said. “It's unaffordable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suarez asked friends and family to scrape together the 10% deposit, but the risk has paid off. The apartment's value has soared by more than a third and the rent covers his mortgage costs, according to Mr. Suarez. That paper gain has made him confident enough to scale back his payments to interest-only and buy a second small house in Wollongong. That house is also rented out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suarez, his artist wife, Maria Paula Hoyos, and their two young children rent a cheap apartment in suburban Sydney, which they share with a student. When the kids are in bed, Mr. Suarez often clicks through a raft of spreadsheets to check his finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You need to be prepared to take a lot of risk and be very disciplined," he said. “But I like doing it because I know I'll never be able to make that money in my regular job. I tell my wife: In two years' time, we'll be able to afford the dream house we want to live in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Australia's central bank</span> warned in September that lending has become “unbalanced" in favor of property speculators. It is working with regulators on possibly introducing new restrictions on mortgage lending to prevent the market from overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Property investors in Australia have historically been at least as creditworthy as owner-occupiers, and mortgage-lending standards remain firmer than in the years leading up to the financial crisis," the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank</span> said. “Even so, a broader risk remains that additional speculative demand can amplify the property price cycle and increase the potential for prices to fall later, with associated effects on household wealth and spending."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darren McCoy bought his first house in his early 20s and now, at 49, owns a handful of investment properties. He realized that the more assets he had, the easier it was to borrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Why use my own money, if I can do it with bank money?" he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Mr. McCoy was in a bidding war for a townhouse in the trendy inner-Sydney neighborhood of Newtown. As the bids soared beyond the A$850,000 asking price, he backed off. “I'm an investor, not an emotional home buyer," Mr. McCoy said. The townhouse sold minutes later for A$1.11 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson and Josh Mitchell   </div><div>480 words</div><div>24 April 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-selling season is off to a strong start when judged against last year, with a double-digit sales increase this March and growing builder optimism offering the latest signs that the housing market is moving past a sluggish stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes declined by 11.4% in March from their red-hot pace in February, which itself registered as the strongest month for sales in seven years, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000, according to Commerce Department figures released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the March tally represents a 19.4% increase from the sales pace of March 2014. Even more broadly, the 129,000 newly built homes sold in this year's first quarter represent a 21.7% gain from the same period of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a normal spring pickup, and it's a stronger market than last year," said John Burns, chief executive of housing research and consultancy firm <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting Inc. in Irvine, Calif., who predicts U.S. new-home sales for all of 2015 will amount to an 11% gain from 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, many multistate home builders have reported double-digit percentage gains in sales so far this year, including <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>.'s announcement Thursday of a 30% gain during the first three months of the year compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>., among the top three U.S. builders by homes sold, on Thursday reported that its 5,139 sales orders in the first quarter marked a 6% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte CEO Richard Dugas Jr. said sales this year have gained momentum due to a combination of sustained, strong job and wage growth, mortgage rates that have remained below 4% since November, and slightly less expensive fees on mortgages backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. "Our expectation is that the strengthening of demand is sustainable and should drive new-home sales for all of 2015," Mr. Dugas said Thursday on a conference call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports suggest the broader housing market is picking up after a sluggish winter. Existing-home sales -- the bulk of the market -- rose 6.1% in March to the highest level in a year and a half, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the new-home market has a long way to go before it reaches normal levels of production. The national sales pace in March amounts to just 66.3% of the market's average annual output since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a sustained recovery in the new-home market could influence the broader economy, given that home construction typically accounts for 5% of U.S. gross domestic product but has languished at roughly 3.1% in recent quarters.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Adam Bonislawski   </div><div>465 words</div><div>24 April 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to eat like a real New Yorker? Order the eggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, on the other hand, a breakfast burrito will mark you as a local.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when in Washington, D.C., don't forget dessert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With help from food-delivery website <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span>, Spread Sheet took a look at meal-order patterns around the U.S., based on <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> orders made within the past year in a selection of affluent ZIP codes from eight metro areas. (The ZIP codes were based on median home prices from online real-estate website Zillow.) The analysis found that even in this age of global restaurant chains, what you eat depends on where you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington, D.C., appears to have a serious sweet tooth. Those residents are 1,020% as likely to order from places with a dedicated dessert menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at individual dishes ordered in each city gives further evidence of D.C.'s apparent passion for sweets. The area's most disproportionately ordered item is the chocolate-chip cookie -- 528% as likely to be ordered in metro D.C. as in the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other city-specific standout dishes include the aforementioned eggs -- any style -- in New York (ordered 331% as often, compared with the national average) and breakfast burritos in Los Angeles (818% as often).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco Bay Area, people can't seem to get enough steamed rice (ordered 923% as often), while Bostonians like their scallion pancakes (529% as often). Atlanta residents are fans of vegetable spring rolls (636% as often).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional preferences also endure, though choices are somewhat more in line with national averages. For example, Chicagoans are 267% as likely to order from a hot-dog restaurant as diners in the rest of the country -- reinforcing the city's status as a stronghold of frankfurter aficionados. Also conforming to stereotype, Los Angelenos, in keeping with their health-conscious reputation, are 235% as likely to order from vegan restaurants as the country at large. And in Dallas, Tex-Mex food predictably takes the day, with locals 591% as likely to order from such restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> analysis also looked at tipping patterns for their orders in the same cities, finding Atlantans to be the most generous, giving an average of 14.8% -- compared with the national tipping average of 13.9%. Dallas locals also were relatively generous, tipping an average of 14.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delivery workers in Chicago beware. The Windy City was the stingiest of the group, with tips averaging 13.5%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>865 words</div><div>24 April 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of Texas, the luxury real-estate market is hotter than a billy goat in a pepper patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices appreciated as much as around 10% from late 2013 to late 2014 in the state's top metro areas, compared with 6% nationwide, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because developers didn't overbuild before the recession -- and still aren't doing so -- homes in Texas didn't suffer the sharp price drops that the rest of the nation did in the housing crisis of 2007, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with NAR. "At this point in time, more construction would be a better thing for home buyers," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, high-end homes are much cheaper than in other parts of the U.S., so Texans can afford bigger properties and qualify for jumbo loans, says Shannon Schmitz, CEO of the Austin-based Shannon Schmitz Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Austin, the state's priciest market, the median sale price for an existing home was $240,700 in December, a 10.7% year-to-year rise, according to NAR. That's less than a third of the $737,600 median price in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Dallas-Fort Worth was up 9% to $188,300, and the Houston metro area was up 9.3% to $198,400. More loans are also likely to be jumbos because the upper limit for government-backed loans in all of Texas is $417,000, rather than the $625,500 for high-price areas like San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas-based lender NexBank's jumbo-mortgage business is thriving in the "Texas Triangle," the Dallas-Houston-Austin metro areas. The company's average jumbo loan amount in Texas is $500,000, accounting for $100 million in Texas jumbo volume over the past 12 months, says S. Matt Siekielski, executive vice president and chief operating officer. The lender's average jumbo loan size in California is $1 million, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas jumbo borrowers are a blend between employed professionals -- business executives, doctors, lawyers -- and self-employed small-business owners, Mr. Siekielski says. "There's not a big difference in the borrower profile between California and Texas," he adds. "What you get is more bang for your buck in Texas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed California and Northeast transplants can go "from a shoebox to a mansion," says Bryan Sherman, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s regional sales executive for Texas and New Mexico. Jumbo borrowers at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> are an average age of 42 years, make a down payment of at least 20%, and have a high credit score and a stable income, Mr. Sherman says. About 75% of the bank's jumbo business in Texas was purchase versus refinance in 2014, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"None of my clients are having any problems qualifying for financing," Ms. Schmitz, the real-estate agent, says. Austin homes priced between $500,000 and $1 million are getting multiple offers, downtown condos typically start at $1 million due to limited inventory, and any in-town home priced up to $3 million won't be on the market long, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas home buyers also can afford more land and tend to want at least an acre or more, says Allie Beth Allman, owner/broker of Dallas-based Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the plunge in oil prices hasn't slowed Texas home sales and appreciation, but if the slowdown lingers too long, they might, Mr. Yun says. "The Texas economy is less than 5% related to oil, but there could be an indirect confidence effect," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Walsh, CEO of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage, remains optimistic. The economy in Texas, like the home market, wasn't as hard hit by the recession and recovered quickly, he says. "Texas seems to do well in both good and bad times," he adds. "It's almost its own economy with the oil and other industry down there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 33 states where Total Mortgage does business, Texas ranks third behind California and New York in terms of the dollar amount of jumbo loans, and interest rates and product lines are similar, Mr. Walsh says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Refi regulations. In a vestige of old homestead protection laws, Texas cash-out refinances are bound by the provisions of any previous refinance, Mr. Walsh says. Many lenders thus won't refinance a home that already has had a cash-out loan, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Some cash competition. Most high-end Austin home buyers opt for jumbo mortgage financing because of the low interest rates, but similar to San Francisco and other places with tight markets, borrowers may lose to cash in bidding wars, Ms. Schmitz says. Cash competition is more likely when values are under $1.5 million, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Fast foreclosure. Borrowers should keep in mind that Texas law allows lenders to foreclose more quickly than in some other states, such as New York and Florida.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor   </div><div>1341 words</div><div>24 April 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Keil paid $2.3 million in 1991 for his townhouse on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade in New York. When he put the roughly 17,500-square-foot house on the market a few months ago, he listed it for $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It sounds unbelievable," he said on a recent afternoon, while taking in breezes and views of Manhattan from the porch. He added: "I wish everything I did brought that return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until a few years ago, homes priced at $40 million or more were almost nonexistent. Not anymore -- with the country's most expensive homes priced well above $100 million, listings and sales at the $40 million mark have popped up across the country. "We've had this creation of a new market category unlike anything that's ever been seen before," said Jonathan Miller of Manhattan-based Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers. "Five or 10 years ago, a $40 million sale or listing was an outlier. And today it's almost commonplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, there were more than 300 homes for sale across the country priced from $35 million to $49 million -- an increase of 24% from the prior year, according to data from real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And these prices aren't just wishful thinking. In the past five quarters, Mr. Miller said at least 37 homes have sold between $30 million and $49.9 million in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. That is up from 14 that sold in those markets during the corresponding period in the boom years of 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These super-luxury home sales are being fueled by a number of factors, Mr. Miller said, including the creation of global wealth since the economic downturn, demand from overseas and domestic buyers looking to park their money in hard assets and the high price of land in prime locations, which forces builders to price their properties higher. It is also common for big-ticket listings and sales to generate a copycat effect, prompting other sellers to put their homes on the market for similarly ambitious prices, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, Beverly Hills real-estate agent Branden Williams relisted a five-bedroom house in the Hollywood Hills. The house, which had been on the market with another agent for about a year, was asking $35 million. Mr. Williams raised its price to $38 million. "All the prices around us have gone up so much in the last year," reasoned Mr. Williams, of Hilton &amp; Hyland, who is co-listing the property with his wife, Rayni, also of Hilton &amp; Hyland, and Ben Bacal, of Rodeo Realty Fine Estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house measures about 13,000 square feet. Owner Sean Sassounian, founder of SAS Textiles, bought the site about six years ago for about $4.5 million. He said he started building the house about four years ago with plans to live in it, but when he and his wife ended up having three children in rapid succession, they decided to move instead to the flats of Beverly Hills to be closer to their schools. The newly completed house has three full kitchens, a gym, a theater, an elevator, an infinity-edge pool with city views, a massage room and a subterranean garage that fits about eight cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the bevy of new decamillion-dollar listings and the headlines that accompany them, it can still take months or years to sell a home at this price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The vast majority of homes over $5 million don't fly off the shelves the way people want you to believe they do," said real-estate agent Leonard Steinberg of Compass, who is co-listing a Tribeca townhouse. Originally listed in October for $48 million, it is now priced at $46 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are more buyers willing and able to pay for homes in the $40 million range than there used to be, they still tend to be particular. "People take their time at this price level," Mr. Steinberg added. In June of last year he listed a Soho penthouse for $37.5 million, which had previously been on the market with another agent for $42 million. The apartment went into contract last month, although Mr. Steinberg said he couldn't disclose the seller or sale price. According to public records, the unit is owned by the singer Jon Bon Jovi, who purchased it in 2007 for $24 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, Alan Wilzig, 50, listed his 7,200-square-foot Tribeca townhouse for $43.5 million. Mr. Wilzig purchased the house as raw space in 2005 for about $3.35 million, and said he spent more than $1 million on the renovation, adding features like a 550-gallon, built-in fish tank and a $200,000 staircase with alligator-skin handrails. His office has an orange accent wall in a nod to his semiprofessional race-car driving team, and he turned the garage into a man cave with a racing simulator and a display case for his trophies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, his wife and two children decided they wanted to relocate to the family's country home upstate, so they decided to put the six-bedroom home on the market. Mr. Wilzig, the former chairman and CEO of the <span class="companylink">Trust Co. of New Jersey</span>, said he had assumed that his home would trade in "the low 30s." But when he saw apartments in the neighborhood selling for more than $30 million, he reasoned that his house, with a garage and 60-foot-long roof deck, should fetch more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that it has been on the market for a while, he said he is planning to reduce the price to somewhere in the $30s in response to feedback from brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To snag a $40 million-purchaser, it helps if the home comes fully furnished, agents said, since these buyers often have other homes and don't want to spend time picking out furniture. Mr. Sassounian's Hollywood Hills house is not just fully furnished, but is stocked with wine in the wine cellar and even toothbrushes in the bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his 18.6-acre estate in Atlanta, Ga., which is listed for $48 million, J.K. MacDonald is throwing in art and antiques he found traveling the globe including a Picasso watercolor, a three-panel poster by Toulouse-Lautrec and a mosaic from the floor of a Roman villa dating back to 450 AD. Furnishing the house "took 25 years and a lot of due diligence and a lot of traveling," Mr. MacDonald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founder of a travel-incentives company called Media Marketing Services, Mr. MacDonald bought the house, known as Chestnut Hall, in 1987 for a then-record $3.7 million and extensively renovated it, expanding the home to its current size of about 14,500 square feet, plus a guesthouse and pool house. There is a wine cellar and fitness center, and the 77,000-gallon pool is one of the largest in Atlanta, he said. For children, there is a playground and a trampoline, and a "little baseball field" with a pitching mound and batting area. There is also a children's playroom with a stage, he said, and its own kitchen equipped with a snow-cone machine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is often the case, selling the house is taking time: It has been on the market about a year so far. "However long it takes is fine with me," Mr. MacDonald said. "I want the right person."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a $40 million listing, agents stand to earn commissions in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Agents pointed out they often invest their own money into marketing expenses, pre-screen potential buyers for financial wherewithal, and even get restaurant reservations for clients. "When you have a very high-end property," Mr. Steinberg said, "you have to go the extra mile."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to eat like a real New Yorker? Order the eggs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, on the other hand, a breakfast burrito will mark you as a local.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when in Washington, D.C., don't forget dessert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With help from food-delivery website <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span>, Spread Sheet took a look at meal-order patterns around the U.S., based on <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> orders made within the past year in a selection of affluent ZIP codes from eight metro areas. (The ZIP codes were based on median home prices from online real-estate website Zillow.) The analysis found that even in this age of global restaurant chains, what you eat depends on where you are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington, D.C., appears to have a serious sweet tooth. Those residents are 1,020% as likely to order from places with a dedicated dessert menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at individual dishes ordered in each city gives further evidence of D.C.'s apparent passion for sweets. The area's most disproportionately ordered item is the chocolate-chip cookie—528% as likely to be ordered in metro D.C. as in the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other city-specific standout dishes include the aforementioned eggs—any style—in New York (ordered 331% as often, compared with the national average) and breakfast burritos in Los Angeles (818% as often).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco Bay Area, people can't seem to get enough steamed rice (ordered 923% as often), while Bostonians like their scallion pancakes (529% as often). Atlanta residents are fans of vegetable spring rolls (636% as often).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional preferences also endure, though choices are somewhat more in line with national averages. For example, Chicagoans are 267% as likely to order from a hot-dog restaurant as diners in the rest of the country—reinforcing the city's status as a stronghold of frankfurter aficionados.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also conforming to stereotype, Los Angelenos, in keeping with their health-conscious reputation, are 235% as likely to order from vegan restaurants as the country at large. And in Dallas, Tex-Mex food predictably takes the day, with locals 591% as likely to order from such restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> analysis also looked at tipping patterns for their orders in the same cities, finding Atlantans to be the most generous, giving an average of 14.8%—compared with the national tipping average of 13.9%. Dallas locals also were relatively generous, tipping an average of 14.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delivery workers in Chicago beware. The Windy City was the stingiest of the group, with tips averaging 13.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Keil paid $2.3 million in 1991 for his townhouse on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade in New York. When he put the roughly 17,500-square-foot house on the market a few months ago, he listed it for $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It sounds unbelievable," he said on a recent afternoon, while taking in breezes and views of Manhattan from the porch. He added: “I wish everything I did brought that return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until a few years ago, homes priced at $40 million or more were almost nonexistent. Not anymore—with the country's most expensive homes priced well above $100 million, listings and sales at the $40 million mark have popped up across the country. “We've had this creation of a new market category unlike anything that's ever been seen before," said Jonathan Miller of Manhattan-based Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers. “Five or 10 years ago, a $40 million sale or listing was an outlier. And today it's almost commonplace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year, there were more than 300 homes for sale across the country priced from $35 million to $49 million—an increase of 24% from the prior year, according to data from real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And these prices aren't just wishful thinking. In the past five quarters, Mr. Miller said at least 37 homes have sold between $30 million and $49.9 million in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. That is up from 14 that sold in those markets during the corresponding period in the boom years of 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These super-luxury home sales are being fueled by a number of factors, Mr. Miller said, including the creation of global wealth since the economic downturn, demand from overseas and domestic buyers looking to park their money in hard assets and the high price of land in prime locations, which forces builders to price their properties higher. It is also common for big-ticket listings and sales to generate a copycat effect, prompting other sellers to put their homes on the market for similarly ambitious prices, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, Beverly Hills real-estate agent Branden Williams relisted a five-bedroom house in the Hollywood Hills. The house, which had been on the market with another agent for about a year, was asking $35 million.

</div><div class="author">By Josh Barbanel   </div><div>750 words</div><div>23 April 2015</div><div>15:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the peak spring season for home sales begins, the market across the region is showing considerable strength, especially in the Hamptons, with its deep pool of affluent summer-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite frequent winter storms that snowed in many Hamptons properties on the eastern end of Long Island, the number of sales from January through March was the highest during any first quarter since 2007—during the last real-estate boom, market reports show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Hamptons house or condo was $920,500, in the first quarter, up 4.6% from the same quarter in 2014. It was the third-highest median price since 2008 at the end of the market boom, according to a market report compiled by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few expensive bold-face sales were logged in the first quarter, and the median price was below the $975,000 median price during the fourth quarter of 2014, which was the highest price since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of strength emerged in markets across the region, from Long Island to Fairfield County in Connecticut. Sales and median prices rose, compared with the same quarter a year earlier, as the inventory on the market fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said the regional numbers reflected national trends as economic conditions improved. “Across the region inventory is remaining tight and prices are edging hirer and sales activity is starting to rise," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ginger Thoerner, a Corcoran broker based in Bridgehampton, on Long Island, said the weather this winter delayed many showings. That has unleashed a rush of activity now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It got started later, but it is now as busy as we have been," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has triggered some bidding wars. When the owner of a new custom-built house in East Hampton dropped his price sharply a few weeks ago, it produced three competing bids and led to a contract for more than $7 million, Ms. Thoerner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, data compiled by Jeffrey G. Otteau, an appraiser and market analyst, showed that activity and prices lagged for much of last year, with the number of contracts beginning to rebound last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While statewide market data aren't complete, Mr. Otteau estimates there was a 2.5% rise in prices across the state in the first quarter, the largest increase in a year. Inventory is lowest in many of the counties nearest New York City. Hoboken was among the strongest markets, with a 1.3-month supply of homes on the market at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the median sale price of a home was $360,000 during the first quarter, up 4.3% from a year earlier, but down slightly from the last quarter of 2014, according a report by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. Listing inventory was down slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Fairfield County was $354,900, up 3.5% from the year-earlier period, but down 5.4% from the previous quarter. Listing inventory was down 20.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, the median price of a single-family home was $600,000, the same as in the first quarter of 2014, but 5.6% above the median price in the previous quarter. Listing inventory was down 11.6% from the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hamptons during the first quarter, there were only three sales for $25 million or more. A vacant parcel at 64 Further Lane sold for $30 million, a modern oceanfront house on Surfside Drive went for $27.5 million, and a mansion on Meadow Lane in the Town of Southampton sold for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was particular strength in still expensive but slightly more affordable homes, those priced between $1 million and $5 million, said Dottie Herman, president of Douglas Elliman. Those sales rose 7.3%, she said, while sales of more than $5 million were down 10.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ernest Cervi, a Corcoran executive who oversees sales on the East End of Long Island, said the Hamptons market was changing. New high-service condominium developments are coming to market, along with developments of new single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“First-time buyers bought condos, along with some people who were scaling down," Mr. Cervi said. “They offer a lifestyle, with tennis and a pool, spas and other services."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lisa Beilfuss   </div><div>562 words</div><div>23 April 2015</div><div>11:17</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. said its first-quarter profit dropped 26%, as closings fell and orders were soft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in the company, which had gained 15% over the past 12 months through Wednesday's close and outpaced the gain in a basket of home builder stocks, slumped 9% in morning trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing consumer confidence, low mortgage rates and low inventory have helped spur new home sales over the quarter. The annual sales pace hit a seven-year high in the most recent report from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>, while the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported a 7.8% surge in new home prices in March from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Chief Executive Richard Dugas acknowledged improving demand, orders rose 6% over the quarter at Pulte versus 30% at rival <span class="companylink">DR Horton</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte was hit by a higher-than-anticipated income tax expense, acquisition accounting and weather-related construction delays that slowed closings, Mr. Dugas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Atlanta-based home builder, one of the nation's largest, said closings slid 2% to 3,365 homes. Net new orders rose 6% to 5,139 homes, and the value of net new orders also rose 6% to $1.7 billion. Backlog totaled $2.6 billion, up from $2.4 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expect that we'll be able to get our production-related closings back on schedule over the balance of the year with the majority of the delayed closings occurring in the third and fourth quarters," said Chief Financial Officer Robert O'Shaughnessy. Mr. O'Shaughnessy said that land investment stands behind its full-year expectation as some developments and loan approvals have taken longer. “We still have a lot in the pipeline," he said, “and are working hard to get deals approved and into production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its call, management said Texas was a weak spot during the quarter, with sign-ups down 5%, but the problem wasn't oil. Mr. Dugas instead pointed to the completion of two large communities in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While promotions have been pressuring some builders' margins, Pulte's margin has held up and incentive levels remain low. In its latest quarter, home-building cost of revenue increased 1.5%. The company's gross margin fell to 22.7% from 23.8%, a rate the company says is largely in line with its projection for the year and, according to analysts, is one of the highest in the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pulte has been public about the fact that it is focused less on top-line growth and more on driving better margins and returns over the medium to longer term," said <span class="companylink">MKM Partners</span> analyst Megan McGrath, who went on to say that “the relatively low rate of order growth for Pulte was not unexpected, and we would not expect to see a meaningful acceleration in the next several quarters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the quarter ended March 31, Pulte booked profit of $55 million, or 15 cents a share, down from $74.8 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue rose 1.3% to $1.13 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had projected 20 cents in per-share profit and $1.24 billion in revenue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> Is Stuck in Its Cocoon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to confuse a 40-ton excavator with a crystal ball. But forecasters could do worse than tracking retail sales of the huge, yellow machines sold by <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being the largest seller of equipment used to build stuff or extract the stuff from the ground used to build that stuff, <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s customers' appetite is a sort of macroeconomic early-warning system. Two big worries -- the slowdown in China's property market and a related slump in demand for commodities from crude oil to iron ore -- showed up quickly in its monthly sales reports, helpfully broken down by region and type of machinery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past year has, not surprisingly, been a tough one for the company's shareholders, with the stock price trailing the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> by 31 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And speaking of crystal balls, analysts practically need one to forecast <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s quarterly earnings. Since 2011, these have come in, on average, nearly 19% higher or lower than consensus expectations. In January the stock fell by 7.2% in the session after disappointing fourth-quarter numbers. The next installment, first-quarter figures due Thursday, are seen falling to $1.32 a share from $1.44 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the event of a pleasant surprise, it is difficult to find much basis for an improvement in <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s forecast for the rest of 2015. North America, the sole area of growth in the second half of last year, saw a modest drop in retail machine sales in January and February, likely on a combination of frigid weather and less demand from extractive industries. Meanwhile, there is scant sign of demand turning the corner elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while management's profit guidance of $4.75 a share for 2015 is unlikely to improve, it shouldn't deteriorate. Its outlook for oil, as well as iron ore, copper, and other commodities, as well as for the dollar-exchange rate, was appropriately downbeat in late January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, even <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span>'s sharp share-price correction of late may not have fully accounted for that. Its multiple of debt-adjusted market value to revenue over the next 12 months is 1.75 times. That is above its long-term average and far higher than the one to 1.3 times it has plumbed during other cyclical troughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future is always in motion, but investors may keep moving with their feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of previously owned homes rose to the highest level in 18 months in March, a sign the housing market is gaining strength after a slow start to the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 6.1% last month from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.19 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. That was the highest level since September 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figures suggest the mix of low mortgage rates, steady job creation and pent-up demand could push full-year sales to prerecession levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still factors holding back the market, including rising prices and limited inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a previously owned home was up 7.8% from a year earlier to $212,100 in March, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This price gain of near 8% is not healthy, considering people's incomes are only rising by 2%," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market, the NAR said. Mr. Yun said a six-month supply is a more sustainable level.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In Texas, Home Buyers Go for Jumbo Loans; High-end homes in Texas are much cheaper than in other pricey parts in the country—so home buyers in the Lone Star State can afford bigger properties and qualify for jumbo loans.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Anya Martin   </div><div>874 words</div><div>22 April 2015</div><div>16:36</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of Texas, the luxury real-estate market is hotter than a billy goat in a pepper patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices appreciated as much as around 10% from late 2013 to late 2014 in the state's top metro areas, compared with 6% nationwide, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because developers didn't overbuild before the recession—and still aren't doing so—homes in Texas didn't suffer the sharp price drops that the rest of the nation did in the housing crisis of 2007, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with NAR. “At this point in time, more construction would be a better thing for home buyers," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, high-end homes are much cheaper than in other parts of the U.S., so Texans can afford bigger properties and qualify for jumbo loans, says Shannon Schmitz , CEO of the Austin-based Shannon Schmitz Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Austin, the state's priciest market, the median sale price for an existing home was $240,700 in December, a 10.7% year-to-year rise, according to NAR. That's less than a third of the $737,600 median price in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Dallas-Fort Worth was up 9% to $188,300, and the Houston metro area was up 9.3% to $198,400. More loans are also likely to be jumbos because the upper limit for government-backed loans in all of Texas is $417,000, rather than the $625,500 for high-price areas like San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas-based lender NexBank's jumbo-mortgage business is thriving in the “Texas Triangle," the Dallas-Houston-Austin metro areas. The company's average jumbo loan amount in Texas is $500,000, accounting for $100 million in Texas jumbo volume over the past 12 months, says S. Matt Siekielski, executive vice president and chief operating officer. The lender's average jumbo loan size in California is $1 million, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas jumbo borrowers are a blend between employed professionals—business executives, doctors, lawyers—and self-employed small-business owners, Mr. Siekielski says. “There's not a big difference in the borrower profile between California and Texas," he adds. “What you get is more bang for your buck in Texas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed California and Northeast transplants can go “from a shoebox to a mansion," says Bryan Sherman, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s regional sales executive for Texas and New Mexico. Jumbo borrowers at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> are an average age of 42 years, make a down payment of at least 20%, and have a high credit score and a stable income, Mr. Sherman says. About 75% of the bank's jumbo business in Texas was purchase versus refinance in 2014, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“None of my clients are having any problems qualifying for financing," Ms. Schmitz, the real-estate agent, says. Austin homes priced between $500,000 and $1 million are getting multiple offers, downtown condos typically start at $1 million due to limited inventory, and any in-town home priced up to $3 million won't be on the market long, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas home buyers also can afford more land and tend to want at least an acre or more, says Allie Beth Allman, owner/broker of Dallas-based Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the plunge in oil prices hasn't slowed Texas home sales and appreciation, but if the slowdown lingers too long, they might, Mr. Yun says. “The Texas economy is less than 5% related to oil, but there could be an indirect confidence effect," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Walsh, CEO of Milford, Conn.-based Total Mortgage, remains optimistic. The economy in Texas, like the home market, wasn't as hard hit by the recession and recovered quickly, he says. “Texas seems to do well in both good and bad times," he adds. “It's almost its own economy with the oil and other industry down there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 33 states where Total Mortgage does business, Texas ranks third behind California and New York in terms of the dollar amount of jumbo loans, and interest rates and product lines are similar, Mr. Walsh says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More considerations:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Refi regulations. In a vestige of old homestead protection laws, Texas cash-out refinances are bound by the provisions of any previous refinance, Mr. Walsh says. Many lenders thus won't refinance a home that already has had a cash-out loan, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Some cash competition. Most high-end Austin home buyers opt for jumbo mortgage financing because of the low interest rates, but similar to San Francisco and other places with tight markets, borrowers may lose to cash in bidding wars, Ms. Schmitz says. Cash competition is more likely when values are under $1.5 million, she adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Fast foreclosure. Borrowers should keep in mind that Texas law allows lenders to foreclose more quickly than in some other states, such as New York and Florida.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. home building is off to a slow start this year, though builders remain upbeat amid improving weather, steady job creation and low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts rose 2%[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 926,000 in March, the Commerce Department said Thursday. So far this year starts are averaging only 969,000 a month, compared with just over 1 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts on single-family units, which exclude apartments and represent almost two-thirds of the market, climbed 4.4%. Multifamily units, including apartments and condominiums, fell 2.5%. New applications for building permits, a bellwether for construction in coming months, declined 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected overall March housing starts to jump to a rate of 1.04 million. Most thought weather depressed activity earlier in the year and had expected to see signs of a spring rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The lack of significant bounce-back in the March data raises some questions about the underlying strength in the housing market since we believe the March data should have been mostly free from any negative weather impact," said Daniel Silver, economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders appear to be shrugging off the soft start to the year. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index climbed four points to a reading of 56 in April, the industry group said Wednesday. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mori Hosseini, chief executive of closely held builder <span class="companylink">Intervest Construction Inc</span>., or <span class="companylink">ICI Homes</span>, said his company participated in a 31-home Parade of Homes showcase in Gainesville, Fla., last weekend expecting to see 300 to 400 attendees a day. Instead, he said, the event attracted 1,300 people on Saturday and 1,000 on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You clearly see an incremental increase in sales and velocity," Mr. Hosseini said. “You feel the market is building up in the number of people showing up at the sales offices and coming for a tour."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ICI Homes</span>, based in Daytona Beach, Fla., started construction of 61 homes in March, up from 34 a year ago. The builder caters to upscale buyers in Florida, Georgia and Tennessee, building homes that average $450,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Bauer, CEO of Irvine, Calif.-based <span class="companylink">TRI Pointe Homes Inc</span>., anticipates selling 25% more homes this year than the 3,100 sold last year. He said demand has increased for starter homes as well as move-up homes, more so due to increased consumer confidence than because of low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to have a good spring selling season," Mr. Bauer said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3.67% for the week ending Thursday, down from 4.27% a year earlier, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate reports last month, meanwhile, showed new-home sales rose to the highest level in seven years in February. But sales of existing homes, which account for roughly 90% of all purchases in the U.S., remained below historical norms. Rising prices and limited inventories are constraining the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report offered other signs the effects of bad weather, which may have held back builders earlier in the year, could now be dissipating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the Northeast, the region hardest hit by snowstorms this winter, more than doubled from February to March. The percentage increase was the biggest on record. Activity in the Midwest also climbed, while the starts in the South and West sank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a year earlier, overall U.S. housing starts were down 2.5% in March while permits rose 2.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures are volatile and often revised. Thursday's report showed new-home construction fell 15.3% in February from the prior month, compared with an initially reported 17% drop.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Confidence among U.S. home builders rose briskly this month, an early sign the housing market is picking up after a lackluster winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index climbed four points to a reading of 56 in April, the industry group said Wednesday. A reading above 50 means most builders generally hold a favorable view of the market for newly built, single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected an April confidence reading of 55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This latest increase in homebuilder sentiment suggests that the housing market may be gaining some momentum again," <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, based on a survey of builders, showed that traffic of prospective buyers remains weak, at a reading of 41 this month. But builders' view of present sales rose three points to 61. And their expectations for sales over the next six months climbed five points to 64, the highest level since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As the spring buying season gets under way, home builders are confident that current low interest rates and continued job growth will draw consumers to the market," said Tom Woods, a home builder from Blue Springs, Mo., and the NAHB's chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in confidence comes after a recent surge in new-home sales. The government reported home sales rose[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-to-highest-level-since-february-2008-1427205817?KEYWORDS=New Home Sales] in February to a seven-year high. Many home builders have reported a strong start to the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of rising sales and confidence could lead builders to step up construction of homes, which would create jobs, boost sales of materials, and stoke the economy. However, new-home construction has remained choppy throughout the recovery even when builder confidence has run high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales are about a tenth of the housing market. Sales of previously owned homes, the bulk of the market, picked up[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-up-1-2-in-february-1427119319?KEYWORDS=existing home sales] in February but haven't reached their pace of late last year, and they remain far weaker than late 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness comes despite historically low interest rates and a recent stretch of strong job creation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the housing market faces headwinds: Job growth slowed last month and the U.S. economy has lost momentum since last summer. Mortgage rates are expected to rise if and when the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> raises short-term interest rates, expected to occur later this year. Higher home prices may be preventing many buyers from qualifying for a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's report showed that most builders view conditions favorably in the South, Midwest and West, but that they view conditions unfavorably in the Northwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ATLANTA -- It took Akuansa Graham seven minutes on a recent morning to craft a $124,000 bid for a three-bedroom Buford, Ga., home he had never seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust</span> executive went to public auctions in the years after the financial crisis looking to buy homes lost to foreclosure. Now the 38-year-old crouches over a computer and relies on algorithms that evaluate home values, proximity to schools and crime rates to outrace rivals for any remaining bargains offered by real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't see your competitors now, so it's important we move before everyone else does," said Mr. Graham, a regional director based in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the low-hanging fruit from the housing bust mostly picked, Wall Street-backed buyers of real estate are increasingly turning to quantitative data analysis as a way of accelerating their search for a dwindling supply of available homes that can be transformed into rental properties. Math-driven models powered by historical patterns can size up homes sight unseen and calculate future income in minutes, allowing private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, the <span class="companylink">Alaska Permanent Fund Corp</span>. and other bulk purchasers to skirt neighborhoods with softer rental demand or properties that need costly repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advances in how companies use technology to evaluate mountains of data have quickened everything from stock trading to student-test-performance evaluations to patient care. Behind the new speed in real estate is a change in how big buyers find most of their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 housing crash, large investors mostly competed for deals face to face at public auctions. In 2009, homes acquired after foreclosure or for less than the amount owed on the mortgage -- also referred to as a "short sale" -- accounted for about half of home purchases in the nation, according to Jade J. Rahmani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As those fire sales slowed, Wall Street-backed buyers turned their focus to mainstream real-estate listings as a way of satisfying their investors who wanted increased exposure to real estate. By 2014, foreclosures and short sales fell to 31% of all purchases as single-family home sales to institutional investors and all-cash buyers hit four-year lows, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first phase was distressed homes," said Justin Chang, chief executive of Colony American Homes Inc., one of the largest single-family rental companies. "The second phase is acquiring homes in a more regular way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When new listings become available, <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>'s Invitation Homes now taps a database of more than 42,000 homes it owns nationally to pinpoint how much renovation a property for sale may require based on its location, square footage and age, among other factors, said Dallas Tanner, the firm's chief investment officer. Invitation Homes is the biggest owner of single-family rental homes in the U.S., according to real-estate data tracker RentRange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp</span>., which owns about 9,200 homes, learned from its models that not everyone in Phoenix wants a swimming pool -- some found the amenity too expensive to maintain or a hassle, Chief Executive David N. Miller said. Silver Bay has since only targeted homes with pools when it can charge higher-than-average rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for conventional real-estate listings is particularly fierce in Atlanta, where the six largest institutional buyers own more homes than in any other market, according to RentRange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland, Calif.-based Starwood Waypoint, one of the six, said it has cut the time it takes to calculate a first bid on a house to eight minutes. "We encourage our guys to make an offer before they see the house," said Ali Nazar, Starwood Waypoint's chief experience officer. "I don't want to wait for anyone else. Our competitors are also fast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One local Atlanta real-estate agent said bulk purchasers are making it more difficult for individual home buyers to compete for new listings. Home prices in Atlanta have jumped 22.5% in two years, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index's data through January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're outbidding all of us," said Brian O'Neal, a Realtor based in McDonough, Ga., a southeastern suburb of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating from the firm's largest branch office at a former meatpacking plant in Atlanta, Starwood Waypoint's acquisitions team evaluates potential purchases with a data map that ranks the "livability" of local neighborhoods according to information provided by local employees of the firm who frequently visit the area. Factors include proximity to retailers and how noisy the neighborhood is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees ultimately weigh about 15 variables when calculating a bid price, the monthly rent and renovation costs. Employee bonuses are based on the accuracy of their home bids and rental estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After submitting a bid, Starwood Waypoint employees visit the home with iPads and take it through a 45-minute inspection, marking what renovations need to be made. The results -- labeled "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" -- get shared on the company's internal network and are used to keep tabs on all of the roughly 2,700 homes Starwood Waypoint owns in the Atlanta area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent visit to a suburban Atlanta home that Starwood Waypoint owns, David Zanaty, a senior vice president, walked into a four-bedroom home available to rent and glanced at his smartphone. "Our guy was here just yesterday," Mr. Zanaty said. "And there aren't any unsatisfactory notes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zanaty inspected whether, as instructed, the thermostat was left at 67 degrees; it was. He opened the dishwasher to verify it had been run recently. He examined the second-floor bathroom, where silver faucets were offset by walls painted in a "toasted almond" color, a pairing seen in many Starwood Waypoint homes because the firm purchases those items in bulk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a good house," Mr. Zanaty said, glancing at the living-room blinds to confirm they were pointed upward, not downward.</p>

Math-driven models powered by historical patterns can size up homes sight unseen and calculate future income in minutes, allowing private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, the <span class="companylink">Alaska Permanent Fund Corp</span>. and other bulk purchasers to skirt neighborhoods with softer rental demand or properties that need costly repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advances in how companies use technology to evaluate mountains of data has quickened everything from stock trading to student test-performance evaluations to patient care. Behind the new speed in real estate is a change in how big buyers find most of their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the 2007-2008 housing crash, large investors mostly competed for deals face to face at public auctions. In 2009, homes acquired after foreclosure or for less than the amount owed on the mortgage—also referred to as a “short sale"—accounted for about half of home purchases in the nation, according to Jade J. Rahmani, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As those fire sales slowed, Wall Street-backed buyers shifted their focus to mainstream real-estate listings as a way of satisfying their investors who wanted increased exposure to real estate. By 2014, foreclosures and short sales fell to 31.2% of all purchases as single-family home sales to institutional investors and all-cash buyers hit four-year lows, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first phase was distressed homes," said Justin Chang, chief executive of Colony American Homes Inc., one of the largest single-family rental companies. “The second phase is acquiring homes in a more regular way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When new listings become available, <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>'s Invitation Homes now taps a database of more than 42,000 homes it owns nationally to pinpoint how much renovation a property for sale may require based on its location, square footage and age, among other factors, said Dallas Tanner, the firm's chief investment officer. Invitation Homes is the biggest owner of single-family rental homes in the U.S., according to real estate data tracker RentRange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp</span>., which owns about 9,200 homes, learned from its models that not everyone in Phoenix wants a swimming pool—some found the amenity too expensive to maintain or a hassle, Chief Executive David N. Miller said. Silver Bay has since only targeted homes with pools when it can charge higher-than-average rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition for conventional real-estate listings is particularly fierce in Atlanta, where the six largest institutional buyers own more homes than in any other market, according to RentRange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland, Calif.-based Starwood Waypoint, one of the six, said it has cut the time it takes to calculate a first bid on a house to eight minutes. “We encourage our guys to make an offer before they see the house," said Ali Nazar, Starwood Waypoint's chief experience officer. “I don't want to wait for anyone else. Our competitors are also fast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One local Atlanta real-estate agent said bulk purchasers are making it more difficult for individual home buyers to compete for new listings. Home prices in Atlanta have jumped 22.5% in two years, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index's data through January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They're outbidding all of us," said Brian O'Neal, a Realtor based in McDonough, Ga., a southeastern suburb of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Operating from the firm's largest branch office at a former meatpacking plant in Atlanta, Starwood Waypoint's acquisitions team evaluates potential purchases with a data map that ranks the “livability" of local neighborhoods according to information provided by local employees of the firm who frequently visit the area. Factors include proximity to retailers and how noisy the neighborhood is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees ultimately weigh about 15 variables when calculating a bid price, the monthly rent and renovation costs. Employee bonuses are based on the accuracy of their home bids and rental estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After submitting a bid, Starwood Waypoint employees visit the home with iPads and take it through a 45-minute inspection, marking what renovations need to be made. The results—labeled “satisfactory" or “unsatisfactory"—get shared on the company's internal network and are used to keep tabs on all of the roughly 2,700 homes Starwood Waypoint owns in the Atlanta area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent visit to a suburban Atlanta home that Starwood Waypoint owns, David Zanaty, a senior vice president, walked into a four-bedroom home available to rent and glanced at his smartphone. “Our guy was here just yesterday," said Mr. Zanaty. “And there aren't any unsatisfactory notes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zanaty inspected whether, as instructed, the thermostat was left at 67 degrees; it was. He opened the dishwasher to verify it had been run recently. He examined the second-floor bathroom, where silver faucets were offset by walls painted in a “toasted almond" color, a pairing seen in many Starwood Waypoint homes because the firm purchases those items in bulk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a good house," said Mr. Zanaty, glancing at the living room blinds to confirm they were pointed upward, not downward.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do home prices affect a child's future income? A new study by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</span> suggests they do—for better and for worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, recently published in the Journal of Urban Economics, found that when households included a 17-year-old, a 1% rise in prices that year resulted in about 0.9% higher annual income for the child later in life—if the parents owned the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the parents were renters, however, it was a different story. Indeed, if the parents of the 17-year-old rented their home, a 1% rise in the home's price resulted in 1.5% lower annual income for the child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The salary findings were based on a sample of about 900 people from an extensive data set compiled by the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>, from which the researchers measured each person's average income between 2005 and 2007. They then matched the individuals to their parents and used data from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> to account for changes in home prices between 1979 to 1999 when the sample members were 17 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal spoke with Daniel Cooper and Maria Jose Luengo-Prado, both senior economists at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</span>, about their report, “House price growth when children are teenagers: A path to higher earnings?[http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2014/wp1413.pdf]" Below are edited excerpts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Sets of Choices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Can you explain the study and your findings?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. LUENGO-PRADO: The idea behind this paper is quite simple. We wanted to see if there was a relationship between house prices when kids are 17 years old and the decisions the kids make about college and earnings later in life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If home prices are rising, parents who are homeowners may have additional resources to finance a child's higher education, either because they feel richer or they can borrow against the home's equity. This may allow their children to attend college or attend a higher-ranked [more expensive] school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the effect of rising house prices for parents who are renters is the opposite. Rising housing prices often mean higher housing costs. Rents go up. They may also need to save more money for a down payment to buy a house in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. COOPER: For renters it's really a trade-off between saving in a rising-cost environment and financing a kid's higher education. Increased costs lead to less investment [in education] relative to owners, who can use their house as collateral to finance their kids' education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Can you put the findings of the study in the context of college costs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. LUENGO-PRADO: We found that the average [annual home-price] appreciation is about 3%. That translates into five months of additional education, an additional semester and a half of college, which is very significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What variables does your study control for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. LUENGO-PRADO: We control for characteristics of the parents—assets, income and educational attainment. Parents may also have a strong preference for education, so we try to capture how good their school district might be. We control for other economic conditions at the local level, like economic growth and unemployment. We want to make sure we are not just capturing long-term differences in economic growth between different areas; let's say New York City versus Detroit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What happened when home prices rose during different points of childhood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DR. LUENGO-PRADO: At age 13, rising house prices affect everyone the same. When house prices are doing well, different localities can collect more taxes and the additional tax revenue benefits everyone within the school district, both homeowners and renters. At age 21, we don't really see an effect. But house prices at age 17 really affect your decision to go to college.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market Expects Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Foreign Investment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate investors are expecting more foreign investment in U.S. commercial real estate in 2015, and that interest rates will remain the same or rise during the year. But they are split on how capitalization rates -- one measure of a property's value -- will be affected, according to a survey released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 60% of 113 institutional real-estate professionals surveyed said they anticipate a significant increase in foreign investment, according to the <span class="companylink">United Realty/Zogby Real Estate</span> Confidence Index for the fourth quarter of 2014. The strengthening dollar in the first part of the year bolsters that sentiment, said Jacob Frydman, CEO of United Realty Trust Inc., a public real-estate investment trust, and the <span class="companylink">United Realty Group</span> of Companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are concerned that "if I continue to hold euros, pounds, yen, yuan, I will find erosion in the value of my holdings," Mr. Frydman said. Foreign investors also view New York City real estate as a safe haven that will provide returns better than alternative investments, such as bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 74% of those surveyed said they expect interest rates to rise or stay flat in 2015, but they were split over whether capitalization rates will rise or fall. A property's cap rate -- its annual income divided by its purchase price -- falls as the price rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those surveyed, 34% expect cap rates to fall in 2015, 34% said they would remain the same, 22% expect them to rise, and 10% weren't sure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Adobe Systems Inc</span>. will join other well-known technology tenants in the Union Square neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Adobe</span> has signed a 10-year lease for 30,644 square feet on two floors at 100-104 Fifth Ave., according to building owner <span class="companylink">Clarion Partners</span>. The company will be consolidating a few offices in the Union Square site and its existing Times Square location, where it is expanding its presence, said Jonathan Francom, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>'s vice president of global workplace solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the past few years, <span class="companylink">Adobe</span>'s New York presence has grown, in part due to several acquisitions," Mr. Francom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clarion, which bought the building for $230 million in 2013, was quickly able to lease space that became available when <span class="companylink">Yelp Inc</span>. moved out this year. Landlords with property in the Midtown South market, where vacancy is low, have to be strategic about making room for new tenants and growing tenants already in their buildings, said Margaret Egan, senior vice president at Clarion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies at the 270,000-square-foot building include <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>. and educational-technology firm Knewton, Ms. Egan said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>897 words</div><div>10 April 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The spring home-selling season is off to a promising start in this military port city, sparking optimism here and in other cities that the market has finally gained momentum after a slow recovery and last year's stall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn was brutal for Jacksonville; home sales sank and foreclosures were running at high levels during the crisis. But in recent months, home sales have shot up, the percentage of distressed homes on the market has declined and traffic at model homes in new subdivisions has been brisk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local home builders and real-estate agents report the most vibrant period of home sales since 2006. Finalized sales of existing homes in the Jacksonville area were up 18% in March from a year earlier, and pending sales were up 30% in that span, according to the Northeast Florida Association of Realtors. The spring selling season runs February to June and typically generates more sales activity than other months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It feels like 2005 again," said Sanford Davidson, a Redfin real-estate agent in Jacksonville, referring to the boom times. "Homes are moving that quickly, especially if they're in the right neighborhood and priced right."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in Jacksonville reflect a national trend -- and perhaps the long-awaited sustainable recovery in the housing market. Nationally, finalized sales of previously owned homes were up 4.7% in February compared with a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. But in cities with robust job growth, like Jacksonville, sales gains ran in the double-digits in March, including a 17.7% increase in Seattle and 20.3% in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales could accelerate in the months ahead, according to an index produced by the Realtors association that tracks signed home-sale contracts. Nationally, the pending-home-sales index in February jumped 12% from a year earlier. In March, pending sales were up 30.6% in Houston, 27.8% in San Diego, 24.2% in Seattle and 23.7% in the Riverside and San Bernardino market in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were high expectations for last year's spring selling season, but sales never took off, in part because of weak consumer confidence, steep price increases from the previous year and a generally tepid economic recovery. Overall, sales of new and existing homes during the 2014 spring season were essentially flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists believe this year should be different because of more sustainable, positive trends. The economy has added 3.1 million jobs in the past year, marking the strongest pace in 15 years. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which guarantees some mortgages for first-time buyers, has moved to ease borrowing requirements and costs. In addition, many buyers who went through foreclosures, bankruptcies or short sales during the downturn now have repaired their credit enough to qualify to buy a home again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the potential for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to start tightening interest rates as early as June has prompted some buyers to take the plunge to lock in low borrowing costs. Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages have been near historic lows at less than 4% since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The spring home-selling season is off to a very good start," said Thomas Lawler, a housing economist in Leesburg, Va. "I think the rest of the season is going to be materially better than a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of newly built homes in February registered their strongest pace in seven years, hitting a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 539,000 in February, Commerce Department data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales still remain well short of the peak of nearly 1.3 million new homes sold in 2005, the uptick of recent months is an early indication that "the market is continuing to improve at a very steady pace," <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>. Chief Executive Stuart Miller said March 19. Miami-based <span class="companylink">Lennar</span>, the nation's second-largest home builder by closings, posted a sales gain of 18% in the quarter ended Feb. 28, compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Momentum is building in Jacksonville. During the downturn, median home prices in the metro area sank 38% to $125,000. Residential construction slid 86%, and sales of foreclosed properties mushroomed to claim 52% of the market in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, resurgent job growth and a decline in distressed homes on the market have allowed Jacksonville to reclaim lost ground. Median prices were $159,000 last year, up 27% from the nadir in 2011. And residential construction permits more than doubled from 2010 to last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers such as Erica Robbins and her fiance, Carl Jacob Segers, are jumping in the market to buy before prices rise further. The couple put a three-bedroom, single-story home in Jacksonville under contract on March 28 for $175,000. Even though the couple separately filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and Mr. Segers was foreclosed upon in 2007, they say their credit has recovered and they are preapproved for a $171,830 mortgage by <span class="companylink">Volunteer State Bank</span>'s Guaranty Trust Wholesale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are buying houses like crazy right now," said Ms. Robbins, a 41-year-old mortgage processor. "So before prices go back up, we might as well buy again."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Taylor   </div><div>402 words</div><div>9 April 2015</div><div>14:56</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century-old house in Mount Kisco, N.Y., is being redeveloped and is listing for $29.5 million. It is believed to be the highest-priced home for sale in Westchester County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Site work is currently being done on the property, and co-developer David Fenton said he expects construction to start later this year. He said the house is going on the market now so the buyer can customize the plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 98-acre property, once owned by showman Billy Rose, was built in the early 1900s, according to Mr. Fenton. Mr. Fenton said he and partner Steve Oder will be spending about $13 million to restore the original brick and limestone house and to expand it to around 23,000 square feet from roughly 8,400 square feet. The partners bought the site from the Legionaries of Christ, a Catholic order which had used it as a retreat center. Mr. Fenton declined to say how much he and Mr. Oder paid for the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the home fetches its asking price, it will set a record for Westchester, according to the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service. The current record is held by the sale of director Ron Howard's Armonk home last year for $27.5 million[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/director-ron-howard-sells-lakeside-house-for-27-5-million-1406230590].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When finished, the house is expected to have nine bedrooms, and eight full and four half-baths, with a motor court and fountain in front, Mr. Fenton said. There will be two outdoor tennis courts and a basketball court, an infinity pool with waterfall and spa, and a formal English Garden with a landscaped maze. A stone water tower on the property will be restored and used as “a gazebo or clubhouse" with a viewing platform that overlooks the Hudson Valley, Mr. Fenton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site is on a ridge that yields views of the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is located about 40 miles from midtown Manhattan. Listing agent Dawn Knief of Julia B. Fee Sotheby's International Realty said it is unusual to find such a large piece of property for sale so close to New York City.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They don't make mansions like Christian de Berdouare's Miami Beach mansion anymore—but it's not a historic home. It's not even finished yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Berdouare got the building permits for his roughly 14,000-square-foot modernist spec home in Miami Beach just before the city's planning department set stricter rules limiting both house size and lot coverage for new residential construction last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tighter rules mean that when the house is finished in the summer, Mr. de Berdouare will own the only property on the block with a legal 4-foot-deep rooftop pool for 10 people. “You can have a Jacuzzi now. That's it, pretty much," said Mr. de Berdouare, the 58-year-old owner of the restaurant franchise Chicken Kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upshot: Mr. de Berdouare is listing it for $35.9 million[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/christian-de-berdouare-chickenologist-lists-miami-home-for-35-9-million-1421945583], banking on its unique perks to seal the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the growing demand—and prices—for luxury real estate, builders and developers are pushing the architectural envelope with oversize floor plans and lavish amenities. In response, city planners are setting stricter zoning rules to rein in development. But tighter rules typically don't apply to existing homes, which are “grandfathered in." This creates a potential economic upside for some homeowners at resale time. Their homes have bonus features that newer properties may never have. But will buyers pay a premium for uniqueness?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vail, Colo., investment manager Michael Tennenbaum is selling his 5,132-square-foot, five-bedroom glass ski house for $13.9 million. When he built it in 1987, some residents in the mostly Bavarian-style ski community balked at the radical glass-tower design. The ski home, composed of several glass boxes on a lot overlooking the slopes, passed the design review board, despite some criticism. “The whole house is a window," Mr. Tennenbaum said about the feeling inside the home. Today, it likely wouldn't pass review, said George Ruther, the director of community development, because the ample use of glass exceeds current building standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tennenbaum knows the home isn't for everyone. “If you don't like it, you don't care" that the home is one of a kind, he said, adding that he built it for himself and his wife, not for resale. Donna Caynoski, an agent with Slifer, Smith &amp; Frampton, who isn't involved in the sale, said that neighbors are finally catching up to its modern aesthetic, but high-end buyers will likely want to make renovations in a house of its age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local ordinances in the U.S. became increasingly stringent in the 1980s, when the first wave of mega-mansions cropped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele McGrath, principal planner for Beverly Hills, Calif., said the impulse to maximize size and amenities is driven by rising land prices and new owners trying to make the most of their investment. “It's understandable to me that people would come in and try to max out the code," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It made sense to Iranian businessman Sion Shooshani, who wanted to make the most of his half-acre hillside property in an area where building height is limited to 14 feet. To sidestep the limits, Mr. Shooshani enlisted builder-designer Hamid Omrani to build into the steep hill to create the multilevel, roughly 20,000-square-foot house that includes an indoor racquetball court and pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the plans were unveiled, some neighbors in the area—comprised mostly of midcentury-modern homes—complained. But it was no use. “There was nothing on the books that said you couldn't [build] this," said Arta Wildeboer, 32, an attorney and Mr. Shooshani's grandson, who lives at the home with his grandfather and other family members. Ms. McGrath, a city planner, said hillside-construction rules changed shortly after this project was permitted—perhaps in part because of this home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the house isn't for sale, Mr. Wildeboer said the family gets frequent offers from real-estate agents with international clients. Gary Gold, an agent with Hilton &amp; Hyland, said the uniqueness of the home might attract some prospects, but many high-end buyers are looking for newer construction. The home's renovations were completed in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the right buyer, a unique grandfathered home is a chance to buy what can no longer be built, but there are limitations, said Lane Kendig. He is a strategic adviser for community-planning firm Kendig Keast, based in Sugar Land, Texas, a Houston suburb. In most cases, the grandfathered perks—the right to build closer to the waterfront, or to have extra-tall ceilings, for instance—are tied to the existing home. Tearing down the house or making too many renovations will often void those exceptions and subject the property to the latest rules, which are almost always more stringent, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In some cases, you would never get it approved," said Greg Mottola, a principal with Bohlin Cywinski Jackson in San Francisco, where he says renovation can be stymied when grandfathered exceptions no longer apply to the proposed upgrades, forcing the owner to scale back the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alternative, tearing down and starting new, is almost always more complicated and “might make a site unbuildable," he said, because of a number of new regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers face the most hurdles in heated markets, where years of development may have spurred stricter and more frequent regulation. That has been the case in Miami Beach, where Mr. de Berdouare is building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was lucky to get this thing in before the changes," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought the half-acre waterfront property for $3.075 million in 2008—his third purchase on the exclusive North Bay Road, which has been a hotbed of sales activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he put about $11 million into the seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom home, including furnishings, and is selling for $35.9 million. Other features include a Roman-style bathtub carved from a single piece of marble and a private dock. Thomas Mooney, head of the Miami Beach planning department, agreed that the home would be difficult to build under the latest code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People at this level, they like unique," said listing agent Mirce Curkoski with ONE <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. He expects to raise the listing price if it hasn't sold by its mid-June completion date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unique can be both an asset and an impediment. In Bryn Athyn, Pa., about a 30-minute drive north of Philadelphia, landscape photographer Feodor Pitcairn is selling his 6,300-square-foot home on 10 acres designed by the midcentury-modern luminary, Richard Neutra—rare on the East Coast. The glass-and-stone house, built in 1962, is surrounded by 812 acres of protected land that can never be developed, thanks to a trust that Mr. Pitcairn helped establish in 1970, after the home was built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home was listed last year for $6 million, and conditions for a sale seem to be in Mr. Pitcairn's favor: The home is one of the last projects designed by the renowned architect and it's in a conservation easement. The future owners are guaranteed privacy because home-building isn't allowed there anymore. Still, there have been no takers; agents have since lowered the price to $3.95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pitcairn, now 80, is selling the home to downsize. He recognizes what a rarity he has, but also that the market is challenging. “I think that a Neutra house like this in California would have gone a long time ago."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>810 words</div><div>7 April 2015</div><div>16:41</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Ventas Inc</span>. announced Monday that it would spin off 355 skilled nursing facilities and outpatient recovery centers into a new real-estate investment trust, the latest sign of the growing interest in highly specialized medical properties, which carry more risk but have the potential for high returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new company, which isn't yet named, could have a market value of more than $5 billion based on trading multiples for similar companies, said Green Street Advisors, a research firm. Ventas, one of the largest owners of health-care properties, said the spin off would produce annual net income between $315 million and $320 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we're doing is really creating two REITs that are positioned to deliver outsized growth and results for shareholders," said Debra Cafaro, Ventas chairman and chief executive. “The market is really finally appreciating the value of this asset class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skilled nursing and post-acute care facilities are seen as more risky than medical office buildings and senior-living properties because most customers pay for skilled-nursing care using insurance policies and Medicare. Cuts to Medicare and other government-funded insurance programs can divert money from the facilities, said Kevin Tyler, an analyst with Green Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But demand for such facilities is rising as private insurers push patients to use skilled nursing facilities and outpatient facilities as an alternative to costly, prolonged hospital stays. As a result, larger companies are buying up such facilities, leading to more consolidation. “Broadly speaking, I think we're seeing skilled nursing going from a fragmented private market to a consolidated public market," Mr. Tyler said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, <span class="companylink">Omega Healthcare Investors Inc</span>. agreed to buy competitor <span class="companylink">Aviv REIT Inc</span>. for $1.65 billion, creating the largest REIT focused solely on skilled nursing properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Green Street, buyers of skilled-nursing home assets are putting them in separate companies due to the high valuation the market has assigned to such properties. Omega's shares, which have risen nearly 20% in the last six months, trade at a premium of 60% to the value of the company's underlying assets. By comparison, shares of Ventas were trading at a 20% premium to their net asset value as of last week, while most REITs are currently trading at a premium of about 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, REITs that specialize in health care properties produced total returns of 35.5% last year, including dividends, making them the second-best performing real estate sector after apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Investment Center for Seniors Housing &amp; Care, a Maryland nonprofit that tracks investment in the medical real estate sector, reported that sales transactions involving senior housing and nursing care facilities rose 17.4% between 2013 and 2014, from $14.8 billion to $17.4 billion. Last year's deals in the sector amount to nearly six times the annual dollar amount of deals in the first years of the downturn in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REIT executives and analysts say that partnerships between large REITs and smaller operators of senior care and nursing facilities are becoming more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, <span class="companylink">Health Care REIT Inc</span>., with a market value of $27 billion the largest REIT focused on medical properties, announced a partnership with <span class="companylink">Mainstreet Property Group</span>, which develops senior housing properties and post-acute care centers, where patients receive treatment and live-in buildings that resemble hotels, complete with private rooms and even high-end dining facilities, after surgeries and other hospital procedures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal the two companies struck, Mainstreet will complete construction of 62 post-acute and assisted living facilities using loans from <span class="companylink">Health Care REIT</span>, which will retain exclusive rights to buy the portfolio, worth an estimated $1.4 billion, once it is built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Inpatient care at hospitals is becoming less and less relevant," said Scott Brinker, <span class="companylink">Health Care REIT</span>'s chief investment officer. “When we're talking about an older person who has just had knee surgery, for example, and needs to recover for 20 days or so, that recovery is happening in a post-acute facility, rather than in a hospital. There's been a significant increase in demand for that. Consumers want it, the payers want it, the providers want it. It's a huge opportunity for growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the growing interest in skilled nursing and post-acute care centers, Ventas is still betting big on hospitals. Unrelated to the spinoff, Ventas on Monday also announced it would buy hospital operator Ardent Medical Services Inc. for $1.75 billion in cash. Ms. Cafaro said hospitals are still “at the top of the food chain in the health care business," and benefiting from an influx of newly-insured patients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued stock-market gains and low interest rates drove sales of vacation homes to the highest level on record last year, putting one segment of the housing market above its prerecession peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> estimates vacation-home sales amounted to 1.13 million properties last year, up 57.4% from 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year's estimated tally topped the high from 2006 to become the biggest year for vacation-home sales volume since the Realtor association started tracking the market in 2003. Vacation homes accounted for 21% of all sales last year, the highest share since the survey's inception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small sample size of the Realtor group's survey, which was based on responses by just 1,971 people who bought U.S. homes in 2014, led some economists to posit that the results might be exaggerated. Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, suggested that the gains in the report might "overstate the strength" of that market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Zandi noted that vacation-home sales account for one-fifth of all home sales and "that should more or less rise over the next five to 10 years" as the income and number of vacation-home buyers increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtor association found that buyers last year had median household income of $94,380, up from $85,600 in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of buyers is likely to grow in the years ahead as 76 million-plus baby boomers advance in age and buy vacation homes that eventually will become retirement homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the prospect of rising prices has spurred buyers to act sooner than later. Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which have hovered below 4% since November, are poised to rise later this year as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> increases short-term rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kris Anderson, team leader with Your Premier Team at ReMax Excalibur in Scottsdale, Ariz., said her team of six agents handled 10% more vacation-home transactions last year than in 2013. Most buyers are purchasing properties to live in for a few months a year before moving into them full-time in retirement a few years later. Many are buying now to avoid higher prices and rates later, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of her agency's clients, Steven and Roberta Strader, bought a three-bedroom home in Surprise, Ariz., last month with the intent of spending up to five months a year in it. The couple, both 72 years old, split time between Arizona and Lacey, Wash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Strader said the value of an Arizona condo that he and his wife bought in 2005 had risen enough to justify selling it this year and combining those proceeds with some stock-market gains to buy the house in Surprise for $225,000. "We felt that the market was strong enough that we could take some assets to spread around in more than just stocks," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least part of last year's gain in vacation-home sales can be traced to more purchases of condominiums and townhomes as vacation properties, the Realtor association said. The survey found that more respondents bought condos (27%) or townhomes (18%) than in previous years. More purchases of such smaller vacation homes likely contributed to an 11.1% decline in the median price of vacation homes sold last year to $150,000 and a decline of 200 square feet in their median size to 1,500 square feet.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values around the U.S. are growing at a rate far slower than was seen a year ago, a welcome trend for affordability that could be offset by headwinds such as stagnant wages and potentially rising mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices increased 4.5% in the 12 months ended in January, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> /Case-Shiller Home Price report released Tuesday. That is far slower than the 10.5% rate posted in January 2014 and brings the rate down to a pace last seen in late 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slowdown, would-be buyers won't necessarily find bargains as home values are still outpacing the average pay raise. According to Labor Department data, the average hourly wage of private-sector employees increased 2.2% in the year ended in January. Economists expect the March employment report to be released Friday will show wage growth remained around 2% for this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are rising roughly twice as fast as wages, putting pressure on potential home buyers and heightening the risk that any uptick in interest rates could be a major setback," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee for the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists project mortgage rates will increase later this year, after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> starts to raise its target short-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expected interest-rate increase, along with the growth gap between prices and wages, means an increasing share of house hunters will be priced out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a problem for a lot of renters who want to be homeowners," said Svenja Gudell, senior director of economic research at realty website Zillow. "They can't save for a down payment. They have difficulty in qualifying for a mortgage. And in expensive areas like San Francisco and San Diego, they can't find houses they can afford."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the calculation to buy a $300,000 home, with a 20% down payment. At the current 30-year fixed rate of 3.90%, a buyer would need to earn just over $48,500 a year to meet the 28% monthly payment-to-income ratio that most banks require. If home prices rose an additional 4.5%, the house would cost $313,500 a year from now. Assuming mortgage rates hadn't changed, the bank would require an income of $50,700. But if pay raises continued to average just 2%, the same buyer would have an income of about $49,500, putting the house beyond his reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Harbaugh, a broker at RealtyFlex of N.E. Indiana, said housing demand in the Fort Wayne area is being supported by increasing employment. Buyers also are motivated to get into the market while mortgage rates are low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said the disconnect between prices and wages can't last indefinitely. "Inevitably, it will become crunch time," he said, unless home-price gains slow or incomes increase faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squeeze is worse for buyers in some metropolitan areas. Of the 20 cities included in the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> price report, six have seen home prices surpass or rebound close to the 2006 peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, Denver and Miami saw the strongest 12-month increases, with growth above 8%. Washington, D.C., saw home prices rise just 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narrower measures of home prices accelerated slightly in January, but price growth in general has been slowing since the end of 2013. The home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 4.4% in the year ended in January, up from a 4.3% rise in December. The 20-city price index was up 4.6%. That is slightly better than 4.4% in December.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring Puts Bounce in Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demise of the housing recovery has been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fact that bond yields -- and, therefore, mortgage rates -- did precisely the opposite of what Wall Street expected in 2014 by staying low, the pace of home-price appreciation slowed. The year-over-year change in the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20 City Composite index has fallen sharply to 4.5% last December from 13.8% in November 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only should Tuesday's report on prices for January show a slight quickening, but the ingredients appear right for a strong spring and summer. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal see the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index's year-over-year pace having risen to 4.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage market remains friendly, with the average 30-year mortgage rate recently falling to around 3.7% from 4.4% a year ago. Credit conditions have loosened, too. Federally supported mortgage guarantors <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reduced their down-payment thresholds in December and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> sharply lowered the premium it charges for insuring mortgages in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, supply and demand appear conducive to price increases. Research provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> said recently that the share of home sales that are distressed, such as foreclosures, has grown less year over year each and every month since July 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although for-sale inventories and even rental vacancy rates are low, there are indications of a robust start to the spring selling season. On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported February's seasonally adjusted index of pending home sales hit its highest since June 2013. That came despite frigid weather across much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bulls shouldn't extrapolate the trend very far, though. Once the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> starts raising interest rates, affordability will begin slipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Say 30-year mortgage rates are a percentage point higher a year from now, and prices are 5% higher. Then a monthly mortgage payment, assuming a typical down payment, would rise by about 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing recovery hasn't restored prices to their precrisis peak, they are at or above their long-run trend on some measures. That includes their relationship to rents and the long-run pace of residential inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enjoy the house party while it lasts.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A forward-looking gauge of U.S. home purchases rose in February to the highest level since June 2013, a sign the housing market is finding its footing this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday its pending home sales index, which is based on contract signings for purchases of existing homes, increased 3.1% to a seasonally adjusted level of 106.9 in February from an January's downwardly revised reading of 103.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected pending home sales would rise 0.5% last month. Home sales typically close within a couple of months after signing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has increased in three of the past four months. The figure was up 12% in February from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said the data suggests positive momentum heading into the spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is “driven by a steadily-improving labor market, mortgage rates hovering around 4% and the likelihood of more renters looking to hedge against increasing rents," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competed existing-home sales rose[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-up-1-2-in-february-1427119319?KEYWORDS=Lawrence Yun] 1.2% in February, the Realtors said last week. Sales have stabilized since dipping a year ago, during a time when interest rates on mortgage loans moved up from near-record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 3.71% in February, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Rates inched up from the prior month, but are down from a year earlier and remain low by historical standards. Meanwhile, U.S. employers have added better than 200,000 jobs each month for 12 straight months. That's the best such streak since the mid-1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the finalized sales figures in recent months remain well below their post-recession high touched late 2009. That spike came when the government was offering tax breaks to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes sales, which suffered a deeper decline during the recession, have also improved this year. New home sales rose 7.8% in February to reach the highest level since 2008. Limited inventories have pushed up prices for existing homes. That has helped close the gap in cost between typically more expensive new homes and previously-owned properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, existing-home sales account for about 90% of the overall market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Monday's report, pending sales of existing homes rose in the Midwest and West last month, but fell in the Northeast and the South.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>870 words</div><div>24 March 2015</div><div>22:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising real-estate values are driving more retail companies to consider splitting off their real-estate assets to generate cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Co</span>., the Canadian parent company of <span class="companylink">Saks Fifth Avenue</span> and Lord &amp; Taylor department stores, announced a $1.7 billion joint venture with U.S. mall operator <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group Inc</span>. involving 42 department stores. Hudson's Bay will retain 80% of the joint venture but will lease its store space back from the company. It plans eventually to split off the venture into a real-estate investment trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same month, <span class="companylink">Sears Holdings Corp</span>. said it would split off as many as 300 of its best locations into a separate company by June to raise money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activist investors, meanwhile, have pushed for real-estate split-offs at a half-dozen other companies over the last six months, including fast-food chain <span class="companylink">McDonald's Corp</span>., department store <span class="companylink">Dillard's Inc</span>. and casino operator <span class="companylink">MGM Resorts International</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least a few companies are taking the suggestion seriously. Late last year, <span class="companylink">Darden Restaurants Inc</span>. said it had hired bankers from <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span>. and <span class="companylink">Moelis &amp; Co</span>. to explore options for monetizing its real-estate portfolio, which includes some 1,200 restaurants such as Olive Garden and Capital Grille. In December, casino operator <span class="companylink">Pinnacle Entertainment Inc</span>. said it would seek REIT status as part of a split-off of its real-estate assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is being driven in part by the record-high valuations for real-estate assets. The Green Street Commercial Property Price Index, a measure of commercial real-estate values across all property types, was up 14% at the end of February, the most recent data available, from its 2007 market peak. The MSCI U.S. REIT Index, a benchmark for real-estate stocks, reached 1192.61 this week, just 3.7% below its early 2007 record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates and high bond prices also are driving investors into real estate, where the yields are better, said Stanley Shashoua, a senior vice president with <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> who helped orchestrate the deal for the Lord &amp; Taylor and Saks properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor: favorable tax treatment. Since they were established as a corporate structure in the 1960s, REITs have been able to pay little or no tax on their earnings as long as they distribute the bulk of their profits to investors through dividends. Tax savings led to a wave of REIT conversions over the last two years by companies with large real-estate portfolios, including data-storage firms, operators of telecommunications infrastructure and even gym owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you combine higher multiples with tax savings, there's a lot of creative thinking that goes on," said Jim Sullivan, a managing director at Green Street Advisors, the research firm that produces the price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some companies, a real-estate split-off is a way to shine light on their value so investors will pay a premium for the company's shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We own assets that were invisible to our shareholders and what we've done is expose them to shareholders so they can understand what value is related to the real estate," said Richard Baker, Hudson's Bay's executive chairman. “This is a very different type of situation from years ago when retailers sought to create real-estate ventures in order to develop new projects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson's Bay's shares are up 17% on the Toronto Stock Exchange since announcing its joint venture with Simon on Feb. 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The danger for operating companies is that split-off companies won't get the lofty valuations they expect because investors might worry their profits are too dependent on the fortunes of a single tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Sears or Dillard's or K-Mart gets in trouble, “Even a whisper of trouble is going to affect the cost of equity capital" for a split-off that owns those retailers' locations, said Gilbert Menna, a partner at <span class="companylink">Goodwin Procter LP</span> in Boston and chairman of its real-estate capital-markets group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some market watchers point to the experience of <span class="companylink">Penn National Gaming Inc</span>., a casino operator that split off its real-estate assets into a REIT called <span class="companylink">Gaming &amp; Leisure Properties Inc</span>. in late 2013. Since the transaction was completed, Penn National's share price has fallen more than 73%, which was expected because of the value of the assets being separated from the company. Gaming &amp; Leisure Properties has seen its share price fall 16% since the split.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate split-offs are “a kind of instant way of creating shareholder value," said Alex Bumazhny, a casino analyst who covers Penn National for <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. Mr. Bumazhny pointed out that Gaming &amp; Leisure's shares are trading at 16.5 times earnings, more than twice Penn National's old multiple. “But the jury is still out as far as long-term performance."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Josh Mitchell   </div><div>706 words</div><div>25 March 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pickup in consumer prices and higher demand for new homes point to a firming in two areas of recent concern for the economy, potentially reassuring the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> as it considers raising interest rates later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consumer-price index -- covering everything from Americans' rent to the cost of their dental care -- rose in February for the first time in four months, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Overall prices were up 0.2% from January, though they were flat from a year ago. The move suggested inflation pressures are slowly building back up after succumbing to a six-month slide in oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, sales of newly built homes surged nearly 8% in February to an annual rate of 539,000, the highest level since early 2008, the Commerce Department said. Such sales are only about a tenth of all home purchases, but a sustained pickup -- along with early signs of a shortage of homes on the market -- could nudge builders to ramp up construction. That would translate into more jobs and higher demand for building materials, providing a jolt to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, many home builders have reported a strong start to this spring's selling season and expect that momentum to continue amid strong job growth and mortgage rates holding at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span>, a closely held builder operating in 11 states, sales orders in February and March are up 5% to 10% from the same period last year. Chief Executive John Johnson attributed the gain to better consumer confidence and low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inflation and housing reports sent encouraging but tentative signals following a stream of data recently showing that the world's largest economy had lost steam since the end of last summer. They also hit on two areas the Fed is monitoring closely: the housing market, which policy makers view as frustratingly slowly despite ultra-cheap mortgage rates; and inflation, which has stubbornly stayed below the central bank's target for nearly three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is some tentative evidence that the economy is maybe turning back up just like it did last year," said Joseph LaVorgna, the chief U.S. economist for <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the economy remains wobbly. Many economists project gross domestic product grew at an annualized pace of between 1% and 2% in the current quarter, down from the fourth quarter's 2.2% rate. Economic growth surged in the middle of last year, but the recovery reverted to a moderate pace, perhaps in part due to nasty weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has signaled it is prepared to raise rates later this year -- perhaps as early as June -- but only if it sees further progress in the labor market and signs that inflation is heading up to a healthier level. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> targets inflation of 2% -- as measured by a Commerce Department gauge, not the consumer-price index -- to ensure the economy is expanding at a healthy pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has kept rates near zero since the recession to spur hiring, spending and investment and jump-start economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This should mute concerns over broader disinflationary pressures in the economy," Richard Moody, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>., said in a note to clients. He added the latest consumer-price data could give the Fed confidence inflation is slowly heading toward its 2% target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation is expected to remain low in the short term, due to the strong dollar -- which lowers the price of imports -- and depressed energy prices, which fell sharply starting last summer due to a buildup in global supplies. The drop stabilized earlier this year and prices rebounded slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of energy, prices are rising at a stronger clip. Core prices -- excluding food and energy -- have climbed 1.7% over the past year, Tuesday's CPI report showed. The rise in core prices has been driven largely by higher costs for housing, as many families who can't qualify for mortgages or prefer to rent have driven up demand of rentals.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—New-home sales rose to the highest level in seven years in February, a sign of strong demand that could help boost the broader U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built single-family homes[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/] increased 7.8% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 539,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures for the prior month were revised up to a rate of 500,000 from an initial estimate of 481,000. Sales haven't consistently registered above 500,000 since the spring of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many home builders have reported a strong start to this spring's selling season and expect that momentum to continue amid strong job growth and mortgage rates holding at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span>, a closely held builder operating in 11 states, sales orders in February and March are up 5% to 10% from the same period last year. Chief Executive John Johnson attributed the gain to better consumer confidence and low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's evidence that buyers who had been forestalling or delaying their decision are now comfortable enough to buy," Mr. Johnson said in an interview. “And there's some awareness that interest rates aren't going to stay down forever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Phoenix area, <span class="companylink">Fulton Homes</span> has doubled its sales orders in the first quarter from a year ago by marketing through radio and social media to buyers who have waited several years for their credit to recover after dealing with foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis Webb, Fulton's vice president of operations, said such boomerang buyers now account for about a third of Fulton's sales. All told, Fulton sold roughly 40 homes each month in the first quarter, compared with its year-ago rate of 20 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The frustrating thing is, our traffic was good last year, but the sales weren't there," Mr. Webb said. “This year, we've had good traffic, and the sales are there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big, publicly traded builders also have seen sizable gains in sales. <span class="companylink">Lennar Corp</span>., the No. 2 builder by closings, said last week that orders were up 18% in its quarter ended Feb. 28 from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales represent about one-tenth of the overall housing market, and monthly figures are frequently revised. February's advance estimate came with a margin of error of plus or minus 15.2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broader trends point to a sector constrained by limited inventory and fast-rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-up-1-2-in-february-1427119319], which account for roughly 90% of all purchases in the U.S., increased 1.2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.88 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. <span class="companylink">News Corp</span>, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also owns <span class="companylink">Move Inc</span>., which operates a website and mobile products for the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a slight improvement from the prior month, the level remains below historical norms. The arrival of more new homes on the market could help boost sales across markets, though builders face challenges of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oregon, demand is strong enough that <span class="companylink">Legend Homes Corp</span>. is restricting the number of homes it sells to conserve its limited labor, materials and land. That is especially the case in land-constrained markets such as Portland. “There's enough market to sell everything that I put together," Legend President Jim Chapman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legend, a closely held builder based in Portland, sold 10 houses a month in the first quarter, giving it “pretty strong" sales momentum in comparison to a year ago, Mr. Chapman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday's data showed bad weather didn't appear to hold back buyers last month. In the Northeast, sales of newly built single-family homes rose sharply to an annual rate of 43,000. Sales also increased in the South but declined in the Midwest and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, sales were up 24.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new-home inventories tightened. At February's pace, it would take 4.7 months to exhaust the supply of newly built homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a newly built home stood at $275,500 in February, up 2.6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The data support our view that the housing market remains in recovery mode and that activity for the rest of the year is likely to improve at a modest, albeit choppy, pace," Blerina Uruci, economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House values are rising, but homeowners are still slipping underwater in many U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 21 of the 50 biggest U.S. housing markets, the number of borrowers who owe more on their homes than the homes are worth increased during the fourth quarter, according to a report to be released Friday by <span class="companylink">Zillow Group Inc</span>., a real-estate information company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, the picture got better, but only marginally so. About 16.9% of all mortgaged homes were underwater in the fourth quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the third quarter. Zillow said the normal share of underwater borrowers is generally thought to be around 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called negative equity persists in many markets even as home values continue to recover from the housing bust. <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, values rose 5.9% in 2014, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Zillow said, is that while average home prices are rising, the low end of the market is seeing values fall. More than 27% of homes with values in the bottom third of their market were underwater in the fourth quarter. In Detroit and Atlanta, about half of such homes were underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapidly rising home prices in some metro areas succeeded in pulling millions of homeowners out from negative equity over the past few years, but with home prices flattening, that process has stagnated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negative equity tightens home inventory, since homeowners aren't able to sell without getting agreements from lenders to perform a so-called short sale. It can also keep foreclosure rates elevated when owners can't come to such agreements but have to sell because of job loss or other reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Svenja Gudell, Zillow's director of economic research, said she expects the rate to remain elevated because many homes that are still underwater are in large subdivisions that haven't regained value as quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are homeowners who are underwater who will stay underwater forever," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Natasha Kelly and her husband, Jeff, were forced to sell their home in a Philadelphia suburb for less than they owed on the mortgage when he got a new job in the New York region. They still owe around $170,000 on their mortgage and have listed the three-bedroom house for $125,000, according to their agent, Kirk Simmon of Re/Max Main Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I try to detach the memory and sentimental part, but it's hard when people come through at $125,000 and still don't want it," said Ms. Kelly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> Director Melvin Watt earlier this year said the agency, which regulates mortgage-finance companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, was considering a program to reduce mortgage principal for a limited number of underwater homeowners. Housing advocates say such a program would help prevent such borrowers from being foreclosed on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which typically caters to lower-income borrowers, earlier this year lowered fees for mortgages with down payments of as little as 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of such programs say low down payments make homeowners more vulnerable to falling underwater if the housing market dips, especially since fees for selling a home can eat up 6% or more of a sales price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents who specialize in short sales in which the borrower sells a home for less than is owed on the mortgage, said they have seen the number of clients with underwater homes drop off but not disappear even as prices have rebounded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Haralson, a broker with Atlanta Communities Real Estate Brokerage, said that in 2013 he had 110 listings, most of which were short sales. Today he has 50 listings, about 45 of which are short sales, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In Atlanta the areas that were hit the hardest were the last to come back," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital's Priciest House Seeks $22 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A roughly 20,000-square-foot mansion is going on the market for $22 million, which will make it the most expensive house listed in Washington, D.C., according to listing agent Nancy Itteilag of <span class="companylink">Long &amp; Foster Real Estate</span>, an affiliate of <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A neoclassical brick and limestone mansion built in the early 1990s, Fessenden House is in the affluent Forest Hills neighborhood about 4 miles from the White House. With seven bedrooms, nine full bathrooms and five half-bathrooms, the house has an elevator and a temperature-controlled wine cellar and tasting room. Outside, the grounds include formal and informal English gardens, hedges and fountains. There is also a pool, pool house and a sports court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public records, the owner is well-known Washingtonian Samuel Lehrman, whose family co-founded the Giant Food supermarket chain. Ms. Itteilag said Mr. Lehrman is selling because he is an empty nester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Itteilag said the house was inspired by 18th century architecture, such as Dumfries House in Scotland. To build the home, Mr. Lehrman acquired three lots and tore down the existing homes. The resulting property spans nearly an acre, which is unusually large for the neighborhood, Ms. Itteilag said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end market in Washington has been increasingly active, she said, with the number of home sales over $3 million increasing by roughly 20% each of the past several years. The priciest home sold in Washington to date was a seven-bedroom house on Q Street that sold for $24.56 million in 2007, according to the MRIS multiple listing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Coumou of <span class="companylink">Christie's</span> is marketing the house internationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LeBron James Reduces Miami Estate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basketball player LeBron James, who recently left the <span class="companylink">Miami Heat</span> to rejoin the <span class="companylink">Cleveland Cavaliers</span>, has cut the price of his Florida mansion to $15 million, down from $17 million, according to listing agent Tomi Rose of Opulence International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. James bought the six-bedroom, 8 1/2 bathroom estate in Miami's Coconut Grove for $9 million in 2010, according to public records. He put it on the market in October, after announcing in July that he would return to his hometown team, the Cavaliers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than 16,000 square feet of space, the estate sits on Biscayne Bay and has dock space for two 60-foot yachts, Ms. Rose said. It also has a wine cellar, guesthouse, a roof deck off the master suite, an infinity pool and movie theater. Ms. Rose also noted that the master suite has two equally large closets. "In most of these estates, the man gets shortchanged in the closet area," she said. "Not in this one."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rose said she has had several offers for the home, but she hopes the price reduction will help "take advantage of the springtime buyers and move the property." Mr. James didn't respond to requests to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colorado Couple Sell Their Home Again,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a 530-Acre Ranch for $29 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years after selling "Pa Gomo," a 10,360-square-foot home in Telluride, Colo., that scored a record $13.2 million in 2012, Stuart and Valarie Ross are selling their home again -- this time a 530-acre ranch that is listing for $29 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near Glenwood Springs, Colo., the ranch's primary home is relatively small: a two-bedroom contemporary measuring about 2,000 square feet. Made of metal, cut granite and cedar, the house also has an outdoor pool and an angled butterfly roof, according to listing agent Billy Long of Ranch Marketing Associates. He said the purchase price includes architectural plans for a 5,500-square-foot home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean there is no place for visitors: Guests stay in two cabins the Rosses renovated when they purchased the ranch for $13.75 million in 2012. Now named Inyanga in homage to Mr. Ross's childhood in Africa, the ranch is bisected by a creek that is, according to Mr. Ross, "full of trout."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After Pa Gomo we wanted to go smaller and more comfortable," said Mr. Ross, a 55-year-old retired health-care executive, in an email. Plus, "the ranch also provided us with a new project for a few years to fend off the boredom of retirement!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross said he's "a little surprised" to be selling the home, but said they want a new project now that they've "whipped the property into shape."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We love to travel and take on new challenges so we are looking for the next adventure," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This isn't the only property in the area priced in this range, Mr. Long said. The nearby Bear Wallow Ranch is listed for $29.5 million. Mr. Long said that ranch is larger but Inyanga has more access to water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan Duplex Relists for $27.5 Million After Big Sale in the Same Building</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of a record-setting sale at 740 Park Avenue, one of New York's best-known buildings, a five-bedroom duplex apartment is returning to the market for a discounted $27.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 14-room duplex on the fourth and fifth floors was previously on the market for $29.5 million and was taken off the market about a year ago, said Kyle W. Blackmon, head of luxury sales at Compass, who has the listing. He added that it is now the right time to sell in part because of the "momentum" following the August sale of an 18-room unit on the 12th and 13th floors of the building for $71.3 million -- a record for a New York City co-op.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has been owned since the 1970s by investor Peter Huang. According to the book "740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building" by Michael Gross, Mr. Huang paid $145,000 for the apartment. Mr. Blackmon said Mr. Huang is selling because he is spending more time out of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huang's apartment is one of only a few in the building with the original layout intact, Mr. Blackmon said. It also retains many of the original details, such as plaster mouldings, door handles and hinges and a spiral staircase with a brass balustrade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by Rosario Candela in 1929, 740 Park Avenue has long been one of Manhattan's priciest and most prestigious buildings, with a notoriously difficult co-op board. Famous previous residents of the limestone-clad building include Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and John D. Rockefeller Jr.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Candace Jackson   </div><div>1545 words</div><div>20 March 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Shelly and Avi Osadon set out to build their dream house on a hillside lot in Beverly Hills, Calif., they commissioned a custom chandelier with 25 handblown glass balls for the entryway. They installed $5,000 "hands-free" toilets with heated seats in most of the home's 10 bathrooms. They even bought $350 electric toothbrushes custom designed by "dentist to the stars" Jon Marashi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now all the Osadons need to do is find someone who wants to buy their dream -- ideally for their $35 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More developers and investors are racing to build increasingly lavish homes on spec. Built on prime lots with master suites larger than most homes and spas and entertainment spaces comparable with those in hotels, many of these homes are also attempting to break new price records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hillsboro Beach, Fla., north of Fort Lauderdale, a yet-to-be-built 30,000-square-foot estate with subterranean parking for 20 cars is seeking $45 million. That is nearly triple the cost of the most expensive sale in the town to date, a property nearby that sold for $17 million last year. Another home, listed for $36 million in Golden Beach, Fla., north of Miami, has a 5,000-square-foot spa and five kitchens. And in Los Angeles, a $55 million spec home with expansive city views includes an air-conditioned "auto gallery" with a spinning turntable and room for 15 cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody wants new," says Carmen D'Angelo, the listing agent for the Hillsboro Beach home. "If I had five or six more of these, I'd sell six more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say the surge reflects an ultraluxury housing market that is at an all-time high, fed in part by overseas buyers and house hunters looking to invest in trophy properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are people who are going to buy these homes to park money," says Jeff Hyland, of Beverly Hills-based Hilton &amp; Hyland. One of his agents is working with a developer who is building a 90,000-square-foot spec home, and Mr. Hyland has another developing six 2-acre lots, each of which will feature a 40,000-square-foot spec home. When they are completed in about three years, the 40,000-square-foot homes will be priced around $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, handbag mogul Bruce Makowsky listed a Beverly Hills spec home for $85 million. The home, which included a wine cellar stocked with Dom Perignon and a $200,000 "candy bar" stocked with sweets, received several offers before selling in December for $70 million, a local record. The buyer was Markus "Notch" Persson, the 35-year-old developer of the computer game Minecraft. (Messrs. Makowsky and Persson didn't respond to requests for comment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, developer Mohamed Hadid sold a spec mansion in the Los Angeles area for $50 million. In 2013, he sold a 48,000-square-foot property for $32.75 million, the most expensive sale in Los Angeles that year. Now Mr. Hadid is working on a 30,000-square-foot contemporary sculptural-style mansion in Bel Air that has curved concrete, marble and glass walls, and views spanning to the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His property, known as Strada Vecchia, will have an <span class="companylink">IMAX</span> movie theater that he says will be the largest ever installed in a home, a 7,000-square-foot master suite and a kitchen with a sushi bar. On a recent tour of the partially constructed home, he explained that the outdoor circular entryway, decorated with a large sculpture he designed, will be surrounded by water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a home that stands out, he says, means wowing buyers with amenities and design elements they didn't know they wanted. "That's the art of being ahead of the competition," he says, estimating that there are at least 20 contemporary-style homes in the $30 million-and-up price range under construction in the Los Angeles area. Mr. Hadid declines to say what he's spending on the home, but says the listing price will likely be in the $200 million range when the house is completed next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Bacal, one of the listing agents on the Beverly Hills home that sold in December for $70 million, says most developers at the top end of the market hope to make at least a 50% to 60% return on their investment to make the risk worthwhile. With land prices at an all-time high in prime areas, that can mean spending upward of $20 million just for a vacant lot or a teardown -- and then two to four years of carrying costs while dealing with permitting and construction. Despite the obstacles, Mr. Hadid says many new developers have "jumped on that wagon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, demand is holding up. "No one is worried about it until the music stops," says Mr. Bacal. "And it hasn't stopped yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. and Mrs. Osadon, the builders and designers of the $35 million Beverly Hills home, are new to spec building, although they spent 20 years building and designing lavish homes for clients and distributing high-end home-building materials and fixtures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their home, with expansive city and ocean views, has a minimalist, somewhat masculine palette and giant walls of glass that open to the outdoors. The flooring continues into the outdoor living areas and is made up of 5-by-10-foot engineered stone slabs, which Ms. Osadon says have never been used previously in a residential home because of the difficulty of installation. A glass, wood and steel staircase was built with hidden bolts to look unadorned. The Osadons say the staircase cost several hundred thousand dollars, compared with $30,000 to $40,000 for a more typical high-end staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Osadons say they spent less than $10 million for the property in 2010. To get approval to build, they paid to widen the road leading up to the property and other homes before starting construction. Ms. Osadon says she doesn't know how much they spent to build the home, and declined to give an estimate. Construction took nearly two years, and the purchase price includes the custom furniture, artwork and linens. The home is listed by the Agency and Coldwell Banker Previews International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you're building a home like this, there is no budget," says Ms. Osadon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Well, there was a budget, but we quickly abandoned it," her husband adds. Spending more on details like custom-designed wall coverings for the home's elevator could help the home stand out from the competition, they say. According to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> the average listing price for similar homes in the area is $22 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, a spec home in Indian Creek Village, Fla., sold for $47 million. Setting a record for a single-family home sale in Miami-Dade County, it is also credited by many real-estate agents and developers for igniting the current spec building craze in South Florida. The co-developers, including Miami-based Shlomy Alexander, paid about $10.3 million for the lot and spent roughly $15 million to build the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alexander and his son, real-estate agent Oren Alexander, took the profits from that sale and purchased a Bal Harbour waterfront lot for $5.5 million in 2012. They are building another spec home there: a 13,500-square-foot home with a 2,500-square-foot master suite. Designed by architect Chad Oppenheim, whose clients include director Michael Bay, the home will be primarily glass, travertine Romano and Belgian oak. The front gate will have a license-plate recognition system that can let the owner in, and an infinity pool will have a 70-foot-long fish-tank glass wall. The home is scheduled to be completed in about two months, says Oren Alexander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all spec homes are clear success stories. Brook Lenfest, an investor and co-developer of two high-end homes built side by side in Vero Beach, Fla., decided to bring both of his spec homes to a "bidder's choice" sale with Concierge Auctions on March 26th. (The winning bidder will get to choose which home to purchase, and the other goes back on the market.) One, a 15,400-square-foot home on 2 acres, was originally listed for $17.9 million; the other, a 16,120-square-foot home, also on 2 acres, asked $18.75 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two homes were built simultaneously to save some money on building costs, says Mr. Lenfest. Though he declined to disclose what he spent to build the homes, he said between construction, taxes and carrying costs his investment has been "significant." "The auction is definitely a gamble because there is no reserve," says Mr. Lenfest, who has no debt on the properties and is also building a 755-room hotel in Philadelphia. "But it's time for the market to speak and say what they're worth. And it's time for me to accept that."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Shelly and Avi Osadon set out to build their dream house on a hillside lot in Beverly Hills, Calif., they commissioned a custom chandelier with 25 handblown glass balls for the entryway. They installed $5,000 “hands-free" toilets with heated seats in most of the home's 10 bathrooms. They even bought $350 electric toothbrushes custom designed by “dentist to the stars" Jon Marashi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now all the Osadons need to do is find someone who wants to buy their dream—ideally for their $35 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More developers and investors are racing to build increasingly lavish homes on spec. Built on prime lots with master suites larger than most homes and spas and entertainment spaces comparable with those in hotels, many of these homes are also attempting to break new price records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hillsboro Beach, Fla.,north of Fort Lauderdale, a yet-to-be-built 30,000-square-foot estate with subterranean parking for 20 cars is seeking $45 million. That is nearly triple the cost of the most expensive sale in the town to date, a property nearby that sold for $17 million last year. Another home, listed for $36 million in Golden Beach, Fla., north of Miami, has a 5,000-square-foot spa and five kitchens. And in Los Angeles, a $55 million spec home with expansive city views includes an air-conditioned “auto gallery" with a spinning turntable and room for 15 cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody wants new," says Carmen D'Angelo, the listing agent for the Hillsboro Beach home. “If I had five or six more of these, I'd sell six more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents say the surge reflects an ultraluxury housing market that is at an all-time high, fed in part by overseas buyers and house hunters looking to invest in trophy properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“These are people who are going to buy these homes to park money," says Jeff Hyland, of Beverly Hills-based Hilton &amp; Hyland. One of his agents is working with a developer who is building a 90,000-square-foot spec home, and Mr. Hyland has another developing six 2-acre lots, each of which will feature a 40,000-square-foot spec home. When they are completed in about three years, the 40,000-square-foot homes will be priced around $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, handbag mogul Bruce Makowsky listed a Beverly Hills spec home for $85 million. The home, which included a wine cellar stocked with Dom Pérignon and a $200,000 “candy bar" stocked with sweets, received several offers before selling in December for $70 million, a local record. The buyer was Markus “Notch" Persson, the 35-year-old developer of the computer game Minecraft. (Messrs. Makowsky and Persson didn't respond to requests for comment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, developer Mohamed Hadid sold a spec mansion in the Los Angeles area for $50 million. In 2013, he sold a 48,000-square-foot property for $32.75 million, the most expensive sale in Los Angeles that year. Now Mr. Hadid is working on a 30,000-square-foot contemporary sculptural-style mansion in Bel Air that has curved concrete, marble and glass walls, and views spanning to the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His property, known as Strada Vecchia, will have an <span class="companylink">IMAX</span> movie theater that he says will be the largest ever installed in a home, a 7,000-square-foot master suite and a kitchen with a sushi bar. On a recent tour of the partially constructed home, he explained that the outdoor circular entryway, decorated with a large sculpture he designed, will be surrounded by water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a home that stands out, he says, means wowing buyers with amenities and design elements they didn't know they wanted. “That's the art of being ahead of the competition," he says, estimating that there are at least 20 contemporary-style homes in the $30 million-and-up price range under construction in the Los Angeles area. Mr. Hadid declines to say what he's spending on the home, but says the listing price will likely be in the $200 million range when the house is completed next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Bacal, one of the listing agents on the Beverly Hills home that sold in December for $70 million, says most developers at the top end of the market hope to make at least a 50% to 60% return on their investment to make the risk worthwhile. With land prices at an all-time high in prime areas, that can mean spending upward of $20 million just for a vacant lot or a teardown—and then two to four years of carrying costs while dealing with permitting and construction. Despite the obstacles, Mr. Hadid says many new developers have “jumped on that wagon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, demand is holding up. “No one is worried about it until the music stops," says Mr. Bacal. “And it hasn't stopped yet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. and Mrs. Osadon, the builders and designers of the $35 million Beverly Hills home, are new to spec building, although they spent 20 years building and designing lavish homes for clients and distributing high-end home-building materials and fixtures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their home, with expansive city and ocean views, has a minimalist, somewhat masculine palette and giant walls of glass that open to the outdoors. The flooring continues into the outdoor living areas and is made up of 5-by-10-foot engineered stone slabs, which Ms. Osadon says have never been used previously in a residential home because of the difficulty of installation. A glass, wood and steel staircase was built with hidden bolts to look unadorned. The Osadons say the staircase cost several hundred thousand dollars, compared with $30,000 to $40,000 for a more typical high-end staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Osadons say they spent less than $10 million for the property in 2010. To get approval to build, they paid to widen the road leading up to the property and other homes before starting construction. Ms. Osadon says she doesn't know how much they spent to build the home, and declined to give an estimate. Construction took nearly two years, and the purchase price includes the custom furniture, artwork and linens. The home is listed by the Agency and Coldwell Banker Previews International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you're building a home like this, there is no budget," says Ms. Osadon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Well, there was a budget, but we quickly abandoned it," her husband adds. Spending more on details like custom-designed wall coverings for the home's elevator could help the home stand out from the competition, they say. According to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> the average listing price for similar homes in the area is $22 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, a spec home in Indian Creek Village, Fla., sold for $47 million. Setting a record for a single-family home sale in Miami-Dade County, it is also credited by many real-estate agents and developers for igniting the current spec building craze in South Florida. The co-developers, including Miami-based Shlomy Alexander, paid about $10.3 million for the lot and spent roughly $15 million to build the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alexander and his son, real-estate agent Oren Alexander, took the profits from that sale and purchased a Bal Harbour waterfront lot for $5.5 million in 2012.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Business is booming for Europe's bad banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, hungry for bigger returns in a low-interest-rate environment, are racing to buy assets parked in government-owned vehicles charged with getting rid of banks' unwanted loans, real estate and other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government-owned "bad bank" vehicles in the Netherlands and Austria are looking at accelerating the sale of loan portfolios acquired from lenders hobbled by the financial crisis, according to industry officials who have communicated with the bad banks. Ireland's state-owned unit has also increased loan sales over the past year. And the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> announced Wednesday that it is planning to quicken the winding down of its bad bank and pitch GBP 13.2 billion ($19.5 billion) of securitized loans to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a surplus of buyers in the market right now lining up to fight for these portfolios," said Federico Montero, head of loan portfolio transactions at real-estate services company <span class="companylink">Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial crisis, several European governments sought to reinvigorate their banking systems by removing bad debts and other unwanted assets from local lenders' books. The assets were then placed into the government-financed bad banks, which were charged with running down or selling the assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, getting rid of those assets has been a slog. Now, though, the tide is turning thanks to stabilizing asset prices and the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s bond-buying program, which is driving down bond yields and encouraging investors to pump money into riskier assets instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, loan sales by banks came at a record pace. Banks in Europe sold nearly 65 billion euros ($68.9 billion) of commercial and residential property loans, compared with 27 billion euros in 2013, according to <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-equity firms like <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>, <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management LP</span> and <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span> have been among the buyers. Overall, U.S. private-equity firms were involved in 81% of distressed-loan transactions in Europe last year, according to broker <span class="companylink">CBRE Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some state-backed bad banks, the increased demand has forced them to rethink their disposal strategies. On the back of rising property prices, <span class="companylink">U.K. Asset Resolution Ltd</span>., which is managing the unwanted assets of two failed British banks, worked with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> investment bankers to see how it can speed up the disposals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential deals include the sale of GBP 13.2 billion of securitized loans currently held on its books. UKAR has said it will also consider selling its mortgage-servicing unit, which helps customers restructure loan repayments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's quite clear that market conditions have improved," UKAR Chief Executive Richard Banks told The Wall Street Journal. "There is a lot of money washing around." Mr. Banks said banks and private-equity groups had already expressed interest in the GBP 13.2 billion mortgage book but that any deal could take up to 18 months to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of last September, UKAR's assets stood at GBP 70.5 billion. It still has GBP 36.7 billion of outstanding loans from the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span>, and it could take more than a decade to fully wind down the agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland's bad bank, the <span class="companylink">National Asset Management Agency</span>, or NAMA, has sped up sales over the past two years, encouraged by high demand from investors. NAMA is currently preparing to sell its biggest portfolio yet. Project Arrow, the sale of a portfolio of nonperforming assets with a face value of more than 8 billion euros, could be finished by summer, said a person working on the deal. NAMA will continue to put assets and loan portfolios up for sale, as long as investor demand is maintained, a spokesman said. NAMA in January said it had sold 18.7 billion euros of loans, property and other assets, of which 7.8 billion euros, or 42%, was in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other countries have been slower out of the blocks. But the demand is starting to encourage some groups to enter the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austrian bad bank <span class="companylink">Heta Asset Resolution AG</span> is looking to start selling down some of its 18 billion euros of assets, according to a person who has communicated with Heta. The group, which holds assets of the bailed-out Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International Group, is scrambling to fill a capital hole identified by regulators. A Heta spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German bad bank <span class="companylink">FMS Wertmanagement</span> is currently in talks with potential buyers for its first commercial-loan portfolio, called Project Gaudi. The 750 million euros sale is made up of 18 Spanish assets, including hotels and shopping centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Netherlands, bad bank Propertize, created after the nationalization of <span class="companylink">SNS Reaal</span>, is also considering increasing the pace of its loan sales.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alejandro Lazo   </div><div>567 words</div><div>17 March 2015</div><div>16:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's high housing costs are crimping economic productivity, increasing poverty rates, lowering homeownership, increasing crowding and lengthening commute times, a new state report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has some of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S.—a result of the slow pace of development in high-demand coastal cities. The average home price in California, $440,000, is about 2½ times the national average, while California's average monthly rent, $1,240, is about 50% higher than the average U.S. rent, according to a report released Tuesday by the state legislature's independent analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The state's high housing costs make California a less attractive place to call home, making it more difficult for companies to hire and retain qualified employees, likely preventing the state's economy from meeting its full potential," the report's authors wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That high cost is largely driven by a slow pace of construction in the state's major coastal markets, where demand for homes is highest and prices are bid up, the report said. Between 1980 and 2010, for instance, new home construction in the state's coastal metro areas increased by 32%, compared with 54% nationally, the report said. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, the supply of new housing grew even more slowly, by about 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal communities tend to limit new construction through local ordinances, planning boards and voter initiatives, the report said. Costs are often higher, and high-density development is also lower in coastal communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Californians pay a larger portion of their incomes toward housing, which has increased the supplemental poverty measure, a key gauge of poverty that takes housing costs into account. California's rate of poverty by this alternative measure is 23.4%, the highest in the country. High housing costs have also led to delays in home purchases, more debt, longer commutes and a higher propensity toward living in crowded conditions, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the vast majority of low-income and working people, the struggle to keep a roof over their heads becomes more difficult day in and day out," said Larry Gross, executive director of a Los Angeles-based tenant advocacy group, Coalition for Economic Survival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report urges the legislature to pass laws that would promote more density in urban areas. It also advises the legislature to consider changes to the state's environmental review process for new development, as well as changes to local land use and authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Cogdill, president and chief executive of the California Building Industry Association, said that supply and demand has long been the driving factor behind the high costs of California's real estate. While high-density projects might decrease costs, and governments have been increasingly interested in promoting such development, there appears to be less interest from consumers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a number of things that ‘can' be done, but it is a matter of market acceptability for that type of product," Mr. Cogdill said. “It appears to us that people, given their choices, would prefer to have a single-family detached residence on their own, on a plot of land somewhere. That continues to be the premier product."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Housing Starts Plunge in February; Demand uneven in the housing market amid harsh winter weather</span>
</div><div class="author">By Kate Davidson   </div><div>671 words</div><div>17 March 2015</div><div>11:08</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plunged in February, the latest sign that harsh winter weather is slowing economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts plunged 17% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 in February, the Commerce Department said[http://www.census.gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] Tuesday. Starts on single-family units, which exclude apartments and represent almost two-thirds of the market, dropped 14.9%. Multifamily units, including apartments and condominiums, fell 20.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected February housing starts to reach a rate of 1.04 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A broad set of indicators has shown weaker economic activity in recent months. But it isn't clear how much of that is the result of harsh winter weather and how much is underlying weakness in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts plummeted 56.5% in the Northeast last month and 37% in the Midwest, regions that have seen record snowfall and below-normal temperatures this winter. But they also dropped in the 18.2% in the West and 5.9% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We shouldn't be worried about any one data point, especially one so clearly at weather's mercy," said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG. “On the other hand, economic data of all stripes has been weak for two months now and housing starts is just the latest in a weak trend. In that regard there is obviously something else going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-construction figures are also volatile and often revised. Tuesday's report showed new-home construction was unchanged in January from the prior month, up from the initially reported 2% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data are also imprecise to begin with; the 17% starts decrease has a margin of error of 9.5 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New applications for building permits, however, are less sensitive to weather effects and have a margin of error of just 1.7%. A bellwether for construction in coming months, permits rose 3% in February, which economists pointed to as an encouraging sign despite the fact that most of the increase was in the multifamily category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup “suggest[s] that once the adverse weather impact has passed starts are likely to return to more normal," Blerina Uruçi, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader trend shows a market that has been slow to recover from the crash. Housing starts were down 3.3% in February from a year earlier while permits were up 7.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of home-builder confidence fell for the third consecutive month in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even allowing for the weather, the recovery in housing remains slow at best," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions are ripe for a stronger housing market. Interest rates are hovering near historic lows, and job growth has picked up, with employers expanding payrolls by an average 288,000 over the past three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a run-up in home prices and tight lending standards are preventing many families from obtaining mortgages. Those who are buying are generally opting for cheaper previously owned homes rather than new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic indicators have disappointed in recent weeks. U.S. industrial production rose slightly in February, but manufacturing output decline, suggesting the economy has softened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. retail sales also fell for the third consecutive month in February, reflecting a mix of bad weather and consumer caution despite the improving labor market and cheap gasoline prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The trouble is that there is no way to get a solid read on the underlying health of the economy until the [weather] distortions fully unwind," Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in a note to clients. “So, we are stuck in a fog for at least a month, until we see the March data for all of the impacted releases."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Stocks Rebound as Dollar Weakens --- Investors are focusing on the currency's moves and Fed signals on rates at this week's meeting</span>
</div><div class="author">By Saumya Vaishampayan and Jon Hilsenrath   </div><div>890 words</div><div>17 March 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks and Treasurys rose and the dollar's rally took a breather, as investors looked ahead to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s policy meeting this week against a backdrop of softer economic news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials are widely expected to alter the guidance they give the public about interest rates Wednesday, dropping an assurance that they will be "patient" in deciding when to start raising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change will formally open the door to a possible rate increase in June, though Fed officials aren't yet set on acting then. A number of downbeat reports in recent days suggest the U.S. economy may be reverting to sluggishness after a burst of stronger growth last summer, raising new questions about whether 2015 will be a breakout year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, low inflation -- reinforced by a strong dollar -- could give Fed officials pause about rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expectations of a Fed rate increase have in recent weeks capped stocks' rally, sent bond yields higher and fueled a surge in the U.S. dollar against the euro to a 12-year high. But Monday brought a reversal of some of those trends, especially in stocks, which have seen back-and-forth trading since the Dow Jones Industrial Average and <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> hit their most recent records on March 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> advanced 228.11 points Monday, or 1.3%, to 17977.42. The <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span> gained 27.79 points, or 1.4%, to 2081.19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As has been the case in recent weeks, much of the focus for stock investors was on the dollar Monday. The dollar's rally took a breather as the euro rose 0.7% to $1.0570. Traders said that move was enough to give U.S. stocks a bounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overseas early Tuesday, stocks also rose. Australia's benchmark <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">ASX</span> 200 was up 1.1%, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.8%, while Hong Kong's <span class="companylink">Hang Seng</span> Index was up 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The dollar has weakened a little bit, and that's got people somewhat more excited" about U.S. stocks, said Ian Winer, head of equities trading at <span class="companylink">Wedbush Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have grown increasingly concerned that the rising dollar will hurt the earnings of the U.S. multinational companies that dominate the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. currency has risen about 14% against the euro this year as the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> embarked on a new round of monetary-policy easing at the same time as investors expect the Fed to begin raising interest rates later this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks and Treasurys rose and the dollar's rally took a breather, as investors looked ahead to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s policy meeting this week against a backdrop of softer economic news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials are widely expected to alter the guidance they give the public about interest rates Wednesday, dropping an assurance that they will be “patient" in deciding when to start raising rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change will formally open the door to a possible rate increase in June, though Fed officials aren't yet set on acting then. A number of downbeat reports in recent days suggest the U.S. economy may be reverting to sluggishness after a burst of stronger growth last summer, raising new questions about whether 2015 will be a breakout year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eliot Brown   </div><div>838 words</div><div>15 March 2015</div><div>21:00</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2015 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> has struck a deal to purchase the Willis Tower in Chicago for $1.3 billion in what would be the highest price ever paid for a U.S. office tower outside of New York, according to executives of the private-equity firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal for the formerly named Sears Tower, reached over the weekend, would be one of the highest-profile towers bought by <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, which is better known for leveraged buyouts of chains like <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc</span>. than for individual property purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> plans to invest heavily in the retail portion of the building and in upgrading the observation deck, the executives said, in hopes the deck will become a cash cow like those of other skyscrapers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company hopes “to really make this more of a comprehensive tourist attraction" as well as an office building, said Jonathan Gray, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s head of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade for the flashy tower also illustrates how private-equity firms like <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> are finding a dwindling number of bargains in the property sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the company and its peers had been scooping up distressed portfolios of retail properties, hotels and single-family homes meant to be rented out, often well below what the last owner paid. But the property market has recovered dramatically, particularly in major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While commercial property values fell nearly 40% between 2007 and mid-2009, they have now risen 14% above their 2007 peaks, according to the Green Street Advisors commercial property price index. In the process, the billions of dollars worth of property that struggled under weighty debt payments has largely disappeared from the market, having been sold or restructured over the past half decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., “there's not much in the way of distress left, which makes buying tougher," Mr. Gray said at an investor conference last June. It also makes it particularly hard to find <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s bread and butter: properties cheaper than what the last owner paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Willis Tower sale marks a big profit for the current owners, New York investors Joseph Chetrit and Joseph Moinian and Skokie, Ill.-based American Landmark Properties. They paid $841 million for the tower in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners had boosted the building's income by striking deals with tenants such as <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> and insurer <span class="companylink">Willis Group Holdings</span>, which leased the naming rights in 2009. In addition, they redid the observation deck, adding glass boxes so visitors can look down from its peak. The owners settled on <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, known for its “speed and agility, which makes them a formidable competitor for any large-scale offering," said Douglas Harmon, senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, a real-estate services firm that advised the sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the building's price is by no means sky-high. On a per-square-foot basis, its price, about $340, is a fraction of what trophy towers fetch in major cities. The property's initial annual income is between 6% and 7% of its purchase price, said a person familiar with the matter, a rich level by New York or San Francisco standards. There, income generally runs between 4% and 5% of a price for a top-quality tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To boost returns further, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> plans to invest as much as $150 million in the building, largely in investments geared toward boosting it as a tourist and entertainment destination, said people familiar with <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a move has become increasingly common for investors like <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> who target so-called opportunistic purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What people are doing is not looking at the building for what it is right now but looking at the building for what it could be," said Alexander Goldfarb, a real-estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Sandler O'Neill + Partners</span>. “There's a lot more creativity going on with space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company plans to revamp the observation deck again, taking cues from the growing popularity of such decks, which experts attribute to rising tourism and changing cultural preferences. The king is the Empire State Building, which took in nearly 40% of the building's total revenue from 4.3 million visitors, totaling $82 million in income after expenses. Today, the Willis Tower gets more than $25 million from 1.6 million visitors, according to loan documents and people familiar with the matter, an amount that has been rising in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s bet is in part on the Chicago office market, which has been gradually improving and drawing tenants from the suburbs. The tower is roughly one-fifth vacant, giving it some room to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Chicago market is known to be relatively stagnant over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It's just a really tough market," said Mr. Goldfarb, adding that local developers are quick to put up buildings and lure tenants from others. “There's still a lot of open area to develop."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan   </div><div>752 words</div><div>12 March 2015</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunny skies and hula dancers aren't the only things attracting foreigners to Hawaii. Add this to the list: one of the most valuable shopping centers in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mall giant <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties Inc</span>. last week announced it had sold a 25% stake in Honolulu's Ala Moana Center, the world's largest open-air mall, for $1.37 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is notable for two reasons: its sky-high price and General Growth's partner, <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span>, an $84 billion retirement fund making its first major foray into U.S. property investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate typically is valued based on its capitalization rate, or the annual net income produced by a property divided by the purchase price. Like bond yields, falling cap rates indicate rising values, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span>, a 2.2 million square-foot shopping center with 290 shops and 80 restaurants, produced $145 million in net operating income, according to Steve Sakwa, an analyst with Evercore ISI. Based on that, the mall traded at a cap rate of 2.9%, one of the lowest at which a mall has ever sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, the average mall cap rate in March stood at 5.2%, according to Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif., property-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2016, after a scheduled expansion is expected to add another 660,000 square feet of space, General Growth expects the mall to be producing about $215 million in net operating income. That would push the cap rate to roughly 3.9%, still extraordinarily low for the mall industry but perhaps not such a red flag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's not the best mall asset in the country, it is definitely one of the top five," Mr. Sakwa said of <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span>. "I'm not sure there's any other mall in the country that does over $200 million in net operating income a year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth, the country's second-largest mall owner by market value, has been pruning its portfolio since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy nearly five years ago. In 2010, the company owned all or part of 169 malls. Today it has 121.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate investment trust also has started snapping up pricey urban retail properties, including properties on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, at top-dollar prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've really been going through a major portfolio transformation," said Kevin Berry, General Growth's spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth said it plans to use the proceeds from the sale of <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> to pay down about $700 million in debt. <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> also produces more than 10% of General Growth's annual net operating income, the firm said. Selling a stake iallows the company to reduce some of the risk associated with having such high exposure to one asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer of the stake in the Hawaiian mall, <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span>, is one of the largest Australian superannuation funds, which manage large pools of tax-advantaged retirement savings contributed by Australian workers and their employers. The funds are typically invested in a portfolio of equities, fixed-income securities and real assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers often find it easier to buy property assets in one-off deals from private sellers because it is easier to reach a deal quietly, with less competition than there is for REIT assets, said James Fetgatter, chief executive of the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the newer foreigners that have entered the market recently are playing it safe," Mr. Fetgatter said. "They're buying core, stable, trophy assets with lower yields."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Australian fund, the <span class="companylink">Ala Moana</span> represents a blue-chip real-estate investment, despite its high price tag and a recent decline in the value of the Australian dollar relative to U.S. currency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The yields on U.S. property are better than fixed income and safer than equities," said Mark Delaney, <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span>'s deputy chief executive and chief investment officer. <span class="companylink">AustralianSuper</span> is looking to increase its property allocation from about 8.3% to about 10% over the next three to four years, the fund said.</p>
