<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. housing starts rebounded in June, promising to help ease a national shortage of single-family homes and restrain price growth in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 8.3% in June [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.215 million, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal how much construction is in the pipeline, increased 7.4% to an annual pace of 1.254 million last month. That was the largest one-month jump since November 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is one of the best new housing construction reports that I've seen in a while," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts data are volatile from month to month and are subject to large revisions. The 8.3% gain in starts came with a 15.8-point margin of error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of construction had been sluggish in recent months, with starts declining in the previous three months, and permits down in April and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists said that was likely because a warm winter pushed up some activity by a month or two and that the overall trend remains toward continued improvement in the construction sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has been a major concern as construction was on the downslide through the spring. That pattern was broken as builders picked up the pace quite sharply in June," said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, home construction showed strong momentum in the first half of the year. Housing starts in the first six months of 2017 were up 3.9% from the same period in 2016. Permits during this period increased 6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts rose 6.3% in June for single-family construction and increased 13.3% from May for multifamily construction. Permits last month were up 13.9% for buildings with multiple units and up 4.1% for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in single-family starts bodes well for home buyers struggling to find properties to buy. The number of homes on the market has fallen year-over-year for 24 consecutive months, according to the National Association of Realtors, helping drive prices up much more quickly than incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased pace of multifamily construction could create additional challenges for apartment landlords, who already are struggling with tepid rent growth [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/luxury-apartment-boom-looks-set-to-fizzle-in-2017-1483358401] and rising vacancies due to an increase in rental units. The national vacancy rate climbed to 4.4% this spring from 4.2% a year earlier, according to data released by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. this week. Average rents across the U.S. increased 3% year-over-year in the second quarter to $1,335 a month, the smallest year-over-year increase since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wouldn't be surprised if we continued to see rents moderate," Mr. McLaughlin at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said it is likely to be months if not years until housing supply and demand reach an equilibrium, as labor and land shortages continue to slow construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not going to see a boom in housing supply. I think it's going to be continued gradual improvement," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>908 words</div><div>19 July 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners are buying U.S. homes at a record rate, helping push up prices in coveted coastal cities already squeezed by supply shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, foreign buyers and recent immigrants purchased $153 billion of residential property in the U.S. in the year ended in March, nearly a 50% jump from a year earlier, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That surpassed the previous record for foreign investment set in 2015, when foreigners purchased nearly $104 billion of U.S. residential property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dramatic increase was unexpected given the strong U.S. dollar, turmoil in the political arena and restrictions on Chinese buyers looking to take money out of the country, all of which were predicted to damp demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was surprising that it increased and the fact that it increased quite substantially is even more surprising," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors association. "This is not insignificant activity. They are pushing up the prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply in the U.S. is already severely constrained. The number of homes on the market has fallen year-over-year for 24 consecutive months, according to the Realtors association, making the most-recent spring selling season one of the most competitive on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, squeezed by labor shortages, zoning restrictions and a lack of available lots in prime locations, haven't been able to construct enough homes to keep up with demand. U.S. starts for new homes and apartment units are still at just 60% of their 50-year averages, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors have fueled price increases in coastal markets that could be hard to sustain, especially if foreigners ultimately pull back, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average home prices in San Francisco have more than doubled since 2009, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which track home prices across the U.S., though recently the market has slowed as prices have risen beyond what most buyers can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said other cities that are still experiencing significant home-price appreciation -- including New York, Seattle and Miami -- could have similar slowdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the U.S., home prices rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April, according to Case-Shiller. Home prices hit a record in September and price growth has accelerated in almost every month since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent surge in foreign buying was driven largely by Canadians flocking south to escape their own overheated real-estate markets. U.S. home prices are starting to look like a bargain compared with Vancouver and Toronto, where prices rose nearly 30% in the year ended in March. The gains slowed to a 6% year-over-year increase in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's the flashing red exit sign going 'It's time to get out now,'" said Brent Leathwood, a broker in Florida who said he is seeing an uptick in Canadian buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real-estate boom up north also helps give Canadians the cash to invest in vacation properties to the south. Mr. Leathwood said he recently worked with a couple who flew down from Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're shocked at what $300,000 or $400,000 will buy them," he said. In Florida they can get a detached single-family house in that price range, while in Canada even an 800-square-foot condo is roughly twice that much, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers tend to purchase more expensive homes than their local counterparts. The median price for a home purchased by a foreigner was more than $300,000, compared with roughly $235,000 for all existing homes sold in the U.S., according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After dipping in 2016 to nearly $9 billion in sales, transactions involving Canadians this year more than doubled to $19 billion, a new high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the price appreciation that has occurred in those two cities, they have money to spend," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers continue to make up a small share of the U.S. market overall, but in some places they are a significant enough force to help explain why prices are rising so rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases by foreigners accounted for 10% of U.S. existing-home sales by dollar volume in the year ended in March, up from 8% in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers are disproportionately concentrated in a handful of states, with Florida, Texas and California together making up 46% of foreign buying activity, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Yun said, the major factor driving rapid price gains is a lack of new-home construction that is leading to a dearth of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The way to assure more affordable homes is to build more and not to limit the demand. The better approach would be to increase construction," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers remained the largest purchasers of U.S. homes by dollar volume, with $31.7 billion worth of purchases in the year, followed by Canadians, Britons, Mexicans and Indians. The bulk of buyers from China, India and Mexico had recently moved to the U.S., while Canadians and Britons were mostly buying second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kerry Lynn, a broker in New York City, said she is seeing more Canadians buying investment properties because they see Manhattan prices as a relative bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're completely priced out of Vancouver," she said. "They're saying Toronto is getting way more expensive, too."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lingling Wei and Dominique Fong </div><div>1755 words</div><div>13 July 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GUANGZHOU, China -- The more China tries to rein in its roaring housing market, the more obsessed people get about buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, with this southern megalopolis in the throes of a property frenzy, state banks raised mortgage rates. Then came higher down-payment rules for second homes and limits on owning multiple apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result: Prices in Guangzhou continue to climb, and the market one town over has heated up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pei Zhiyong, a 56-year-old advertising executive, was barred by the new restrictions from buying a third apartment in Guangzhou. One Sunday in April, he drove his <span class="companylink">BMW</span> SUV to Foshan, an hour away, to check out a new riverfront high-rise. He figures it's the ideal time to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The harder the government tries to control the market, the more prices will rise," Mr. Pei said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With each new policy intended to restrict home purchases, buyers are piling in. Stressed about the prospect of being left behind, many are borrowing heavily, believing prices will continue to rise despite the restrictions and will soar if the government has to lift restrictions to spur economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another article of faith is that the Communist Party won't allow housing prices to collapse. "The government will spare no effort to make sure there are no big swings in the property market," says Ni Pengfei, a housing expert at the <span class="companylink">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span>, a government think tank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The desperate home buyers are exposing Beijing's inability to control a housing market it has been relying on for economic growth. A decade ago, the real-estate sector, including construction and home furnishings, accounted for about 10% of China's gross domestic product, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's Investors Service</span>. It now accounts for almost one-third, reflecting both a dearth of other investment options and the petering out of manufacturing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Chinese companies staggering under debt levels pegged by <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analysts 164% of GDP, the government has turned to less-indebted corners of the economy to keep growth going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one time, low levels of household debt reassured government officials and economists that a property slump wouldn't trigger a wider financial crisis. But the property-buying binge has changed that equation. Long-term household loans, mostly mortgages, now account for one-third of all new bank loans. Household debt stands at more than 42% of GDP, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>. That ratio has grown 9 percentage points in three years and now surpasses levels in China's emerging-market peers including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Russia. In the U.S., that ratio hit about 85% during the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers want to prevent the property bubble from getting worse, worried that any collapse could send defaults cascading through the banking system, infecting the overall economy perhaps for years to come. On the other hand, they are concerned that an investment slowdown could hamper growth. Economists already are warning that the recent property controls are starting to cause developers to scale back on new projects, potentially denting growth later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lessons from Japan and the U.S. told us that there is no such thing as an ever-rising market," says Li Xunlei, chief economist at Chinese brokerage Zhongtai Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frothy as prices have been, China's housing market isn't vulnerable to a full-blown property downturn like the one in the U.S. a decade ago, economists say. Chinese home buyers often are required to put at least 30% down. Because Chinese banks only have a limited ability to sell off loans as securities, they don't offer risky mortgages like those that triggered the U.S. housing debacle. Moreover, home-equity financing that lets owners borrow against their homes hasn't taken off in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Shenzhen, the average home sells for 44 times average annual household income, compared with around 12 times for homes in New York City, according to an analysis by Zhang Ming, a senior economist at the <span class="companylink">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese government data show that prices across 70 Chinese cities were 9.7% higher in May than a year earlier, a larger year-over-year increase than the 9.3% last September, when the current round of housing controls were instituted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some big cities, the frenzy has moderated somewhat. In Shanghai, the year-over-year increase was 31% in May, compared with 50% last September. Beijing posted a 22% annual increase in May, down from 33% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halfway across China in Lanzhou, a polluted industrial hub at the edge of the Gobi Desert, the housing market is booming. Homes for sale are packed with would-be buyers, including small-business owners who think property is a better bet than shops or factories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices started to take off in September, just as Beijing took its first steps to crack down. By December, Lanzhou's prices were 27% higher than a year earlier. In April, Lanzhou also cracked down with higher minimum down payments and limits on second- and third-home purchases in the city center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market in Lanzhou is too heated," Gao Jia, deputy director of Lanzhou's housing authority, said in an April interview as he leaned back in his chair and smoked a cigarette. "The government needs to make sure the housing price is going up steadily, not too fast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Foshan, a city of seven million dotted with factories making refrigerators, television sets and other household appliances, home prices have risen 18% in recent months as buyers poured in after property controls were imposed in Guangzhou.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pei, the advertising executive, was one of many Guangzhou buyers signing contracts in April for apartments at the Master Work high-rise overlooking the Desheng River in Foshan. He intended to pay for a three-bedroom apartment partly with the proceeds from a studio in Guangzhou he and his wife had just sold. He said it had gone up in price more than 50-fold since they bought it 13 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No other investment is as profitable as property," he said. "Stocks are too risky."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One middle-aged homemaker was so eager to snag an apartment in a Foshan shopping-mall complex that she asked a broker to wait in line all night when sales started in May. "Foshan to Guangzhou is just like Brooklyn to Manhattan," she said. All 300 apartments sold out within 60 hours, according to the broker, Huang Kai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom in Foshan hasn't cooled things off in Guangzhou. Sales agents for the Blessed and Colorful Apartments, a new high-rise complex in the southern part of the city, say that prices for the units have risen nearly 30% since they went on sale in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhang Ying, a 27-year-old web designer who makes about $1,500 a month, bought a two-bedroom apartment in another development in January. Her mortgage payments amount to nearly 80% of her income. "I'm essentially a slave to this property now," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some smaller cities, the property boom is helping to reduce a housing glut produced by earlier overbuilding -- a goal of the central government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tangshan, a heavy-manufacturing city two hours east of Beijing, had benefited from home buyers driven out by new restrictions in the capital. Many buyers appear to be investors who don't intend to move to the city or work there. In late May, Tangshan authorities raised down-payment requirements to discourage speculative buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing rally in Lanzhou, the central China industrial city, also was driven by buyers from outside the area, according to Mr. Gao, the housing official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhang Xiaoqi, a retired accountant, was eyeing an apartment for her son. She was prepared to put 20% down on an apartment early this year. When Lanzhou raised the down-payment requirement to 30%, she gave up. "Originally I could afford a home, but now it's too much," she said. She contends prices shot up because of the restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of last year, real estate accounted for 68.8% of China's household assets, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> says. In the U.S., it is less than 60%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ni, the housing expert at the <span class="companylink">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</span>, estimates that as much as 50% of China's home sales today are for investment, a situation that worries the Communist Party leadership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Houses are for living in, not for speculation," President Xi Jinping said at a December meeting that set main economic goals for 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the government has stopped short of imposing a property tax, which would discourage people from buying homes as an investment and leaving them empty by making it more expensive to own a home. Beijing has shown little political will to force a move that would raise costs for already stretched homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Releasing more land for development is another way to take the pressure out of the property bubble. But local governments rely on land sales to fund their programs and have an incentive to sit on land as it appreciates and sell it to developers in small increments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new rules instituted to tame the housing frenzy in Beijing and Shanghai have angered some buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent weekend, hundreds of people marched down a busy Shanghai shopping street to air grievances over deals thrown into jeopardy. Videos circulating on social media showed protesters clashing with police and some being dragged away -- unrest highly unwelcome in a year of a major Communist Party conclave expected to consolidate Mr. Xi's power. Shanghai promptly eased some restrictions on developers and buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among protesters in front of Beijing's municipal hall one weekend in May was Cui Meng, a 30-year-old saleswoman. Earlier this year, she put up her apartment for sale and borrowed 900,000 yuan (about $132,000) from a friend to buy a three-bedroom home costing 4 million yuan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After new property restrictions took effect in March, the buyer of her apartment pulled out and asked for the deposit back. Without the ability to sell her old home, Ms. Cui found herself unable to repay her friend and facing a mortgage bill representing about 65% of her and her husband's combined income. "It's too much pressure," she said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A labor shortage that has hampered the construction industry for most of the housing market's five-year recovery [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/what-will-the-housing-market-do-next-1491211806]is showing signs of easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of open construction jobs [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/labor-shortage-squeezes-builders-1494075600]fell to a seasonally adjusted 154,000 in May, down from the cyclical high of 238,000 open jobs set in July of last year, according to the most recent Labor Department data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job openings as a percentage of total employment were at 2.2%, down from 2.8% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring "has been expanding," said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "It's just not expanding fast enough."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly data is volatile and the number of open jobs still remains near historic highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of workers has been one of the housing industry's biggest challenges, slowing the construction process for single-family homes and apartments and contributing to a housing shortage[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/housing-shortage-fuels-price-gains-1486684851].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in open jobs suggests employers are having a slightly easier time finding workers to hire. It could also be partly the result of a slowdown in multifamily construction activity as the apartment market becomes saturated[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apartment-market-slumps-as-supply-surges-1490875200]. Developers have been pulling back on starting new projects, although there is still a fairly high volume of projects in later stages of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietz noted the decrease also could be a sign that some builders have put projects on hold[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/labor-shortage-squeezes-real-estate-developers-1498595109].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can have job openings fall because some employers have simply given up," he said. "It can be frustrating when you've got low inventory in your market and you're ready to put up those homes and all of a sudden you don't have enough workers."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Esther Fung </div><div>1210 words</div><div>4 July 2017</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates may help to cool off prices in the world's least affordable housing market, something the government's administrative measures have had little success in doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in Hong Kong have risen to record levels in recent months, defying efforts by the government to stem the tide of rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising interest rates, sparked by recent moves by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>, may succeed where taxes and other government dampening measures have failed. And some experts are warning that if this happens, it might not be pretty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Normalization of U.S. interest rates will eventually raise the mortgage burden of Hong Kong borrowers, posing risks" to the city's export-driven economy and housing market, said Kevin Lam, <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s Greater China economist, in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hong Kong, home resale prices rose on average 21% in May from a year earlier, exceeding the previous peak recorded a month earlier, according to the latest data available from Hong Kong's Rating and Valuation Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been mostly rising since the second half of 2016 after a small dip, as regulatory cooling measures seemed to only have a short-lived impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices have nearly tripled over the last decade and relative to incomes, are close to the highest on record," said Chang Liu, China economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the newest residential projects put out for sale was Park Yoho Genova, where the asking price of a 721-square-foot apartment is HKD$10.4 million, or HKD$14,429 ($1,850) a square foot. The average sales price of a residential property transacted in Manhattan in the first quarter was $1,778 a square foot, according to a report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these prices are comparable, housing is considered much less affordable in Hong Kong because incomes are so much lower. Indeed, for seven years Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable city out of the 406 surveyed by Demographia, a think tank based in Belleville, Il.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's housing crisis is one of the biggest causes of resentment in the region 20 years after its handover to Chinese rule. Housing prices remain high due to the city's large population, land shortages, speculation and ample money supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong also attracts demand from wealthy customers globally, and in recent years its housing prices have been driven up by an influx of newcomers from mainland China[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/mainland-chinas-property-bubble-leaks-into-hong-kong-1476251717].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To head off damaging property bubbles, the government implemented property cooling measures intermittently since 2009, including stamp duties—which are essentially sales taxes—and curbs on bank lending. The latest attempt was in May—the <span class="companylink">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</span> ordered banks to tighten credit assessments and cuts to the loan amounts banks can extend for properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many experts predict these new measures will be as unsuccessful as similar efforts in the past. Buyers in Hong Kong already face some of the most prohibitive rules about home purchases, including a regulation from the central bank requiring home buyers to fork out a minimum down payment of at least 40%. Banks also have to set aside more money as reserves against bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stamp duties have been raised to at least 15% to 30% for individuals and companies purchasing a residence, with some exceptions for permanent Hong Kong residents buying their first home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the years such property cooling measures only had a short term effect. They haven't been as effective as those in Singapore or Canada because of a chronic mismatch between demand and supply and the exploitation of loopholes in these measures, analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, cash-flushed property developers are helping customers skirt the central bank's minimum down payment measures by offering buyers credit so that they can make the down payment on new launches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The authorities are not that determined to crack down on the housing market because it is not in their interest to do so," said Professor Ngai-Ming Yip, an urban studies expert at <span class="companylink">City University of Hong Kong</span>. He pointed out that land premiums and stamp duties from property transactions make up a significant portion of government revenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong's real-estate market is affected by Federal Reserve policy[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-rate-increase-to-cool-hong-kong-property-prices-1450326638] because its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The Fed's loose monetary policy since 2008 has been one of the causes for the low mortgage rates in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately the Fed has started to raise short-term rates and has laid the groundwork for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Mortgage rates in Hong Kong have risen slightly in recent weeks after the authorities expanded risk management requirements for banks extending residential mortgages. But rates are generally still low compared with historical averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if rates rise it could have a major impact on the city's housing market because many mortgages have floating rates. Prices also would likely fall because buyers would be facing higher borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high prices are contributing to a housing shortage in this city of 7.3 million people that dwarfs comparable problems in other cities. Developers have been responding to the supply and demand imbalance by building tiny flats sometimes described as "mosquito apartments[http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/in-hong-kong-the-apartments-are-fit-for-a-mosquito-1433237582].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents live in homes the size of a parking space while people with lower incomes live in cage homes the size of a bunk bed. These have resulted in numerous photo essays[http://www.google.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/search?q=cage homes hong kong&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNnIDSw-PUAhWCRj4KHR15C-oQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1240&amp;bih=897] online depicting their cramped conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of affordable housing options also contributed to discontent that fueled the pro-democracy protests[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/hong-kong-protests-swell-as-riot-police-withdraw-1411979074] in 2014, where supporters carried yellow umbrellas and blocked streets for weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More and more Hong Kongers find it impossible to afford private housing, and are forced to join the queue for public ones," said Joshua Wong, a 20-year old pro-democracy activist, adding that the average wait time for a public housing unit is 4.6 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expressed skepticism that no matter how many public housing flats are built, the root of the housing problem will remain if the government doesn't improve its long-term planning and change its favorable policies toward developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The authoritarian rule together with the government's lack of empathy toward the society will only add fuel to the people's resentment," said Mr. Wong, who was arrested last week during a protest before the arrival of Chinese President Xi Jinping. He said he was released after 32 hours of detention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has pledged to increase the supply of affordable housing. It has promised an additional 94,500 public housing units to be built the coming four years, a higher rate of production than previous years. The stock of public housing flats rose 74,000 between 2006-2016, according to data from Hong Kong Housing Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have to buy smaller and smaller apartments in Hong Kong at higher and higher prices," said Vincent Cheung, deputy managing director, valuation and advisory services at <span class="companylink">Colliers International</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. monetary policy's impact on inflation has weakened since the mid-1980s, while its effect on the credit and housing markets has grown, according to a paper published by the Bank for International Settlements [http://www.bis.org.proxy.library.brocku.ca/publ/work649.pdf] on Thursday. The authors noted that the rising size of mortgages relative to the total credit market helped explain the greater impact of monetary policy on credit. Meanwhile, a weaker relationship between unemployment and inflation explains why the effect on consumer prices isn't as strong as it used to be. Their conclusion: "Macroeconomic stabilization through monetary policy has therefore become associated with greater fluctuations in credit and housing markets. In reverse, trying to stabilize credit and house prices through monetary policy now seems to come at a lower cost in terms of macroeconomic volatility."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco, once the hottest housing market in the U.S., is now one of the coolest, in a reversal that could presage a broader slowdown if more buyers decide it isn't worth chasing rapidly rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth continues to accelerate in many parts of the country, driven by a lack of supply and rising demand. The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which cover the entire nation, rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April after a revised 5.6% year-over-year increase in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in San Francisco increased 5% in April, making the Bay Area one of the slowest-expanding markets in the U.S. and well behind markets such as Atlanta, Boston, San Diego, Las Vegas and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's apartment market also is sluggish. Average rents decreased 0.3% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to data released this week by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the weakening is being caused by a confluence of factors: slowing job growth, less demand from new buyers put off by high prices and, on the rental side, an increase in new-apartment supply as developers try to cash in on a multiyear boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we had the same level of tech-job growth and this [new] supply, there probably wouldn't be an issue," said Conor Wagner, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>, a research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology-sector employment is still expanding, but at a much slower rate. Jobs in the technology, media and information sector had increased by about 15% two years ago, but now there is roughly 1% growth, according to an analysis of <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> data by <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means fewer highly paid workers are able to snap up pricey homes and rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tech is growing more slowly than the rest of the economy, and tech has been the thing that has been driving the economy forward the last decade," said Ted Egan, chief economist for the city of San Francisco. "We are in the middle of a notable slowdown."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, San Francisco is a unique market. The average home price has more than doubled since 2009, according to Case-Shiller, making a slowdown virtually inevitable. The economy is overwhelmingly driven by the technology industry, unlike most other big cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are parallels with the rest of the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, for instance, said the rate of price growth across the nation is unsustainable, and a significant slowdown in home-price gains or even falling prices in some places is expected, especially if job growth slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of home sales in the Bay Area in February sank to its lowest level since 2008, down 3.5% from a year earlier and off 12.5% since 2015, according to PropertyRadar, a real-estate-research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're just seeing the grinding higher of prices weighing on sales," said Madeline Schnapp, director of economic research for PropertyRadar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices hit a record in September, and the pace of growth accelerated steadily through March. But in April, just seven of 20 cities reported greater year-over-year price increases than a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question is not if home prices can climb without any limit; they can't," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "Rather, will home-price gains gently slow or will they crash and take the economy down with them? For the moment, conditions appear favorable for avoiding a crash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price gains across the U.S. in recent years were driven by rising wages, a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, and limited supply. Economists have said they are concerned that price growth that continues to outpace income growth isn't sustainable.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-price growth slowed in April for the first time in months, a trend that, if it continues, could signal that the market finally is starting to cool as buyers weary of rapid price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which covers the entire nation, rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April, down from a revised 5.6% year-over-year increase reported in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices hit a record in September [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-set-a-record-in-september-case-shiller-says-1480428083], and the pace of growth had accelerated steadily since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 4.9% over the year, down from 5.2% in March, and the 20-city index gained 5.7%, down from 5.9% the previous month. That is quite a bit below the expectation of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the 20-city index to rise 6% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accelerating gains have been driven by growing demand thanks to rising wages and a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, as well as limited supply. Economists have said they are concerned price growth that continues to outpace income growth won't be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question is not if home prices can climb without any limit. They can't. Rather, will home price gains gently slow, or will they crash and take the economy down with them?" said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "For the moment, conditions appear favorable for avoiding a crash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, despite the slight slowing, prices are still growing quickly—and much faster than incomes. Home-price growth remains less than half of what it was during the housing bubble in the mid-2000s, when prices grew by more than 14% for much of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are concerned, however, about a handful of markets that have been seeing double-digit or near-double-digit growth. Seattle led the way in April with a 12.9% home-price increase. Portland reported a 9.3% year-over-year gain, and Dallas, which recently replaced Denver in the top three, reported a 8.4% annual increase in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven of 20 cities reported greater year-over-year price increases in April than in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-over-month, the U.S. Index rose 0.9% in April before seasonal adjustment, while the 10-city rose 0.8% and the 20-city index increased 0.9% from March to April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seasonal adjustment, the national index rose 0.2% month-over-month, the 10-city also rose 0.2% and the 20-city index rose 0.3%. After seasonal adjustment, 13 of 20 cities saw prices rise in April.</p>

Sales of previously owned homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-up-in-may-despite-tight-supply-1498053950] increased in May, in a sign that demand remains strong despite a shortage of homes for sale. Existing home sales rose 1.1% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco, once the hottest housing market in the U.S., is now one of the coolest, in a reversal that could presage a broader slowdown if more buyers decide it isn't worth chasing rapidly rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth continues to accelerate in many parts of the country, driven by a lack of supply and rising demand. The S&amp;PCoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, which cover the entire nation, rose 5.5% in the 12 months ended in April[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/home-price-growth-slows-in-april-1498568416], after a revised 5.6% year-over-year increase in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in San Francisco increased 5% in April, making the Bay Area one of the slowest growing markets in the U.S. and well behind markets such as Atlanta, Boston, San Diego, Las Vegas and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco's apartment market also is sluggish. Average rents decreased 0.3% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to data released this week by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JUSTICE DEPARTMENT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenge Explored</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Sanctuary Cities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department is quietly exploring new legal theories to take on so-called sanctuary cities in court, working to force them to aid the Trump administration's aggressive deportation effort, people familiar with the discussion said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a case, if filed, would significantly escalate the Trump administration's pressure campaign against recalcitrant cities and counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has already threatened to cut off federal funding to cities and counties that refuse to facilitate deportations, and it has sought to "shame" jurisdictions that don't cooperate. If successful, the new court efforts would compel local authorities to assist federal immigration officers whether they want to or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, on Friday the Justice Department filed papers in support of the state of Texas' defense in federal court of one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the nation. The statute, which is set to take effect in September, prohibits Texas cities and police departments from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under that law, local Texas law-enforcement officials and sheriffs can face criminal penalties -- including jail sentences -- if they don't comply with requests from federal authorities to detain suspected illegal immigrants until they can be transferred to <span class="companylink">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</span> custody. The Justice Department argues the Texas statute doesn't improperly pre-empt federal law or violate the Constitution. It plans to make those points in oral arguments in federal court in San Antonio on Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in May and prices hit a record level, more evidence of a housing market characterized by strong demand and tight inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new, single-family homes -- a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales -- rose 2.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 in May, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home sold in May was $345,800, the highest recorded for data dating back to 1963.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's going to be very hard to sustain price increases of any large amount going forward because they are pushing against people's ability to afford homes," said Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are converging to strengthen buyer demand. The national unemployment rate in May was 4.3%, a 16-year low, and the economy continued to expand and add jobs in the first half of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the slow pace of new construction is constraining supply. Housing starts declined for the third straight month in May, as builders expressed concern about tight availability of lots and a labor shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, there was a 5.3 months' supply of new homes on the market in May, a relatively low level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ultimately this report is a disappointment for those looking to builders to meaningfully help solve the pressing supply issues in the market overall, especially for entry-level buyers," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of the market, rose 1.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million. The median property remained on the market just 27 days in May, the shortest time since the trade group began tracking the metric six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pressure to close deals quickly, which has afflicted the existing home sales market, is also seeping into the market for new homes," Ms. Gudell said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Path for Foreign-Born</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founders at Risk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration plans to dismantle a regulation that would have helped more foreign-born entrepreneurs build startups in the U.S. without a traditional visa, according to people briefed on the administration's plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Entrepreneur Rule, enacted by the Obama administration in the final days of his presidency and set to go into effect next month, would have let foreign entrepreneurs apply to work in the U.S., provided their startup raised $250,000 from established U.S. investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Department of Homeland Security</span> plans to file an official notice to delay that rule by eight months with the intention of rescinding it, these people say. The delay will give the administration more time to complete the rescinding process, the people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The DHS's decision isn't final and still could change, the people cautioned. After filing an official delay, the DHS will open a comment period which could affect the outcome of the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We cannot speculate on the outcome of the DHS review of the rule. When the review is final, we will make the decision public," said Dave Lapan, a DHS spokesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco Chronicle earlier reported on the possible delay and rescinding of the rule.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Tight Supply</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes increased in May, a sign of solid demand during the housing market's spring selling season in the face of fast-rising prices and tight inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 1.1% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. Economists had expected a modest decline from April. Compared with a year earlier, sales were up 2.7% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that sales of existing homes rose in May -- despite incredibly limited selection, shrinking times on market and rapidly rising prices -- is a testament to just how strong the draw to homeownership is right now for millions of Americans," said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have seesawed from month to month so far in 2017 and hit a 10-year high in March. At the same time, increasingly scarce inventory is driving up prices faster than household incomes are growing. "The way to solve this housing shortage, housing crisis that is developing, is to just build more homes," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Head of Pierson College Stephen Davis wrote in a letter Tuesday that Ms. Chu left her position at the school "and wishes the best to the students."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chu, who taught psychology and Asian-American studies and was dean of the residential Pierson College, apologized in mid-May for two reviews that were deemed offensive and assured administrators and students those were the only such posts. But the Yale Daily News, the student newspaper, published more posts by her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The posts, about area restaurants, movie theaters and gyms, have since been removed from the online review website.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes increased in May, a sign of solid demand during the housing market's spring selling season in the face of fast-rising prices and tight inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 1.1% in May  [https://www.nar.realtor/topics/existing-home-sales]from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists had expected a modest decline from April [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-fell-in-april-amid-tight-inventory-1495634615]. Compared with a year earlier, sales were up 2.7% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that sales of existing homes rose in May -- despite incredibly limited selection, shrinking times on market and rapidly rising prices -- is a testament to just how strong the draw to homeownership is right now for millions of Americans," said Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have seesawed from month to month so far in 2017 and hit a 10-year high in March [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-march-to-highest-pace-since-2007-1492783659]. At the same time, increasingly scarce inventory is driving up prices faster than household incomes are growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The way to solve this housing shortage, housing crisis that is developing, is to just build more homes," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in May was $252,800, the highest nominal level on record and up 5.8% from a year earlier. There was a 4.2-month supply of homes on the market at the end of the month, based on the current sales pace. Inventory has declined on a year-over-year basis for 24 straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median property remained on the market just 27 days in May, the shortest time since the trade group began tracking the metric six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now we're in a true seller's market," said Mark Trenka, owner of Century 21 Trenka Real Estate in Denver. He said a home in the city was brought onto the market Saturday, had 30 showings and attracted 10 offers in one day—and was under contract Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colorado's unemployment rate  [https://blogs-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2017/06/16/jobless-rate-falls-to-record-low-in-california-six-other-states/]was a record-low 2.3% in May, according to the Labor Department. That, together with low inventory, is helping drive a "really competitive" environment, Mr. Trenka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes account for roughly 90% of U.S. homebuying activity. Sales of newly built single-family homes dropped in April  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fell-more-than-expected-in-april-1495548303]after three straight monthly rises, though economists expect the Commerce Department on Friday will report new-home sales rose 3.7% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are working to support buyers. The national unemployment rate in May was 4.3% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-added-138-000-jobs-in-may-1496406822], its lowest level since 2001. The economy continued to expand and add jobs in the first half of 2017, and gauges of household confidence remain elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates rose after last year's presidential election but edged down in recent months. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage [http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html] was 4.01% in May, down from 4.05% in April, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pace of new construction has lagged behind. Housing starts were up 3.2% [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fall-for-third-consecutive-month-in-may-1497616335] in the first five months of 2017 compared with a year earlier, slowing from 5.6% growth in all of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know builders have not caught up with the market," Mr. Trenka said. "We're not getting enough product."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could change if builders ramp up production in response to fresh evidence of strong demand. Miami-based home builder Lennar Corp. on Tuesday reported its new orders were up [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/BT-CO-20170620-702252] about 12% on the year in the three months ended May 31, and the dollar value of new orders rose roughly 17% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slow and steady, though sometimes erratic, market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal," Chief Executive Stuart Miller told analysts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese buyers have been gobbling up houses all over the world in recent years. There could be nasty surprises when the buying stops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are already signs of imminent pain for the global property market, thanks to China's efforts to stop money pouring out of the country. Inquiries from China for foreign real estate fell 31% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to Juwai.com, a portal connecting Chinese buyers to overseas listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property market Down Under looks vulnerable. China accounts for four in every five foreign buyers in Australia, with their interest a prime reason why home prices have surged to unaffordable levels: Prices in Sydney are up 72% since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Australia's household debt now nearing 200% of disposable income, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> downgraded 12 Australian banks and their affiliates Monday, citing housing market risks. Australia's four biggest banks alone have a $1.1 trillion exposure to Australian housing loans, some 55% of their total portfolios, according to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And nearly 40% of home loans are interest-only. Such loans work fine when house prices keep rising. The worry now is that prices will start falling as Chinese buying interest wanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Australian demographer caused an uproar last year after chastising the country's younger generation for being unable to buy houses because they spent too much money on things like avocado toast. Right now, instead of encouraging young people to jump into the housing market, it may actually be better to just let them eat toast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of England Governor Sees Weak Wage Growth Delaying Rate Rises</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At The Eye of the Storm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday evening, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney was scheduled to deliver his annual "Mansion House speech" to the grandees of the City of London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he did not. Instead, the dinner was canceled out of respect for the people left dead or homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney eventually delivered the speech at a breakfast Tuesday morning. But it was the second straight year in which the event has been delayed in response to a national tragedy: In 2016 it was because of  the murder of Jo Cox [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-lawmaker-injured-after-incident-in-parliamentary-constituency-1466085309], a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repeated disruptions to Mr. Carney's schedule reflect the turbulent times in which the central bank is working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its ambitions to normalize monetary policy and raise its key interest rate last year were frustrated by the U.K. vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and the markets' response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the policy outlook remains clouded by developments beyond its control. The surprise outcome of the June election suggests fiscal policy is likely to be a little or a lot looser than once seemed likely, with unclear implications for rate setters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the Brexit negotiations, which began Monday. Almost a year after the vote, the central bank has little more clarity about the terms under which that will take place. Policy makers are assuming a "smooth" exit, or one governed by an agreement rather than none at all. That seems the most likely outcome, but British politics is suddenly full of surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, policy makers are doing the only thing they can, which is to try to understand why inflation is above their 2% target and how long it is likely to be so. They face some difficult decisions in a combustible environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should they let inflation run much higher, a tightening squeeze on incomes could fuel the already strong sense of popular resentment against the establishment. But a series of interest rate increases might go down just as badly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there may be a crumb of comfort. In what are abnormal and unsettling times, Britons may find it reassuring were central bankers to do something that they are supposed to do: raise interest rates when inflation threatens to get out of control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key Developments Around the World</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed's Fischer Expresses Caution About Global Housing Markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer urged global policy makers to continue efforts to strengthen the resilience of their housing markets [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-fischer-expresses-caution-about-global-housing-markets-1497942900], echoing earlier cautionary words from Fed officials about the potential risks of having low interest rates over long periods. "House prices are now high and rising in several countries, perhaps as a result of extended periods of low interest rates," Mr. Fischer said in prepared remarks released ahead of delivery Tuesday at a closed-door conference on macroprudential policy hosted by the Dutch and Swedish central banks in Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed's Dudley Sees More Tightening Ahead, Economy on ‘Even Keel'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York Fed President William Dudley said Monday a gradual pace of rate increases [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-dudley-sees-more-tightening-ahead-economy-on-even-keel-1497880943] will help prolong the economic recovery. In remarks to a business group in upstate New York, Mr. Dudley signaled a willingness to continue the process of slowly raising interest rates as a way to keep the economy humming. Mr. Dudley said the Fed was trying to strike a balance between generating economic growth without at the same time causing inflation to rise too rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evans Says Fed Likely Needs Time to Decide Next Rate Move</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans expressed support on Monday for the U.S. central bank's plan to raise rates further, but added he believes officials can take some time before acting again [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-evans-economy-requires-very-gradual-rate-hikes-1497911250] to ensure inflation is truly moving higher. Interest rate rises so far have been "reasonable," Mr. Evans told reporters after a speech before a gathering of the <span class="companylink">New York University</span> Money Marketeers group. But he added "I don't think we would be poorly served by allowing more time to pass and take in the data" before boosting short-term rates again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Banks Target September for Fed's Balance-Sheet Announcement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of banks now expect the Fed to announce in September its plans to start reducing its balance sheet, rather than in December. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last week the central bank could begin the process "relatively soon." [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/more-banks-target-september-for-feds-balance-sheet-announcement-1497904813] In a May survey by the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span>, respondents on average placed a 40% probability on the Fed announcing a change in its $4.5 trillion portfolio in the fourth quarter of this year, and a 17% likelihood for the third quarter.</p>

In the letter sent to Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Monday, Sen. Warren urged the Fed to invoke its authority under a rule that allows it to remove certain people associated with depository institutions under specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of England Governor Sees Weak Wage Growth Delaying Rate Rises</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney Tuesday said that while rate setters' tolerance for above-target inflation is coming to an end, it is too early to raise the key interest rate [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bank-of-england-governor-sees-weak-wage-growth-delaying-rate-rises-1497943802] for the first time in a decade. In a rescheduled speech to bankers at Mansion House in London, Mr. Carney said weak wage growth raised questions about the strength of domestic inflationary pressures, and he was unsure how the economy would respond to talks between the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> and the rest of <span class="companylink">European Union</span> on the terms of their separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silvana Tenreyro to Join BOE Rate-Setting Panel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Silvana Tenreyro of the <span class="companylink">London School of Economics and Political Science</span> has been appointed to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/bank-of-england-appoints-lse-professor-silvana-tenreyro-to-mpc-1497872102], replacing Kristin Forbes, whose term ends in June. Ms. Tenreyro will join the committee as an external member for a three-year term beginning July 7, the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> said Monday. The appointment comes at a challenging time for the central bank, with inflation set to exceed its target over coming years as the pound's weakening in the wake of a 2016 vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> stokes inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB Criticized for Missing Signals of Banco Popular's Troubles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s top bank supervisor, Daniele Nouy, on Monday faced a grilling [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-warns-of-regulatory-loopholes-for-finance-firms-displaced-to-eu-by-brexit-1497880165] from European lawmakers, who accused the central bank of missing signs that Spanish lender Banco Popular was struggling before it declared the institution likely to fail earlier this month. The ECB's declaration triggered the sale of Banco Popular to its larger Spanish rival <span class="companylink">Banco Santander</span> for the nominal sum of €1. Members of the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span>'s monetary affairs committee criticized ECB supervisory decisions and pushed for information that at times Ms. Nouy couldn't provide. On some occasions, Ms. Nouy said she couldn't answer specific questions due to confidentiality restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Africa Central Bank Rejects Watchdog Demand to Change Mandate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">South African Reserve Bank</span> on Tuesday rejected a demand by the head of the country's corruption watchdog to shift its mandate away from focusing on price stability [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/south-africa-central-bank-rejects-watchdog-demand-to-change-mandate-1497947808], saying the request falls outside her remit. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane on Monday said that South Africa's constitution should be adapted to ensure that the central bank focuses on protecting "the socio-economic well-being of the citizens" rather than the "the value of the currency."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Evidence for a Lower New Normal in Interest Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have long been puzzling over the causes behind the decline in interest rates since 2000, and new evidence from financial markets suggests a decline in the natural rate of interest [http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2017/june/financial-market-evidence-for-lower-natural-interest-rate-r-star/?utm_source=mailchimp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=economic-letter-2017-06-19] has contributed about 2 percentage points to the general downward trend in yields over the past two decades. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco researchers Jens H.E. Christensen and Glenn D. Rudebusch estimate the equilibrium real rate using only prices of inflation-indexed bonds, a financial measure that differs from estimates drawn using macroeconomic models. The issue of whether there has been a shift in the equilibrium interest rate is quite important for investors, policy makers and researchers, the authors note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets Must Grasp that the Fed is No Longer their Best Friend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets are failing to internalize the shift in the Fed's policy regime to normalize its interest rate [https://www.ft.com/content/797a800a-5278-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb] structure and balance sheet, writes Mohamed El-Erian in the Financial Times. "As such, it is more willing to ‘look through' weak growth and inflation data.," he said. Traders and investors, though, seem to be resisting the Fed's forward guidance, instead "betting on the repeat of the past few years during which officials have tended to over-estimate the extent of policy tightening." It is likely that "the central bank is now focusing more on excessive risk-taking by investors and traders, including its potential negative impact on the economy down the road."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's Poor Record on Soft Landings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's Justin Lahart notes two things investors should keep in mind about the Federal Reserve: "One, it is in a tightening cycle [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-feds-poor-record-on-soft-landings-1497890842]. Two, tightening cycles almost always end badly." The aim of the Fed's tightening policy "is to guide the economy to a soft landing," Mr. Lahart writes. "But executing a soft landing is notoriously difficult to pull off. The Fed can only guess at what the economy's just-right levels of growth and employment are, and at what level of interest rates is consistent with hitting those marks."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of England Governor Sees Weak Wage Growth Delaying Rate Rises</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At The Eye of the Storm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Thursday evening, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney was scheduled to deliver his annual "Mansion House speech" to the grandees of the City of London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he did not. Instead, the dinner was canceled out of respect for the people left dead or homeless by the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney eventually delivered the speech at a breakfast Tuesday morning. But it was the second straight year in which the event has been delayed in response to a national tragedy: In 2016 it was because of  the murder of Jo Cox [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-k-lawmaker-injured-after-incident-in-parliamentary-constituency-1466085309], a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The repeated disruptions to Mr. Carney's schedule reflect the turbulent times in which the central bank is working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its ambitions to normalize monetary policy and raise its key interest rate last year were frustrated by the U.K. vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> and the markets' response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the policy outlook remains clouded by developments beyond its control. The surprise outcome of the June election suggests fiscal policy is likely to be a little or a lot looser than once seemed likely, with unclear implications for rate setters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the Brexit negotiations, which began Monday. Almost a year after the vote, the central bank has little more clarity about the terms under which that will take place. Policy makers are assuming a "smooth" exit, or one governed by an agreement rather than none at all. That seems the most likely outcome, but British politics is suddenly full of surprises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, policy makers are doing the only thing they can, which is to try to understand why inflation is above their 2% target and how long it is likely to be so. They face some difficult decisions in a combustible environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should they let inflation run much higher, a tightening squeeze on incomes could fuel the already strong sense of popular resentment against the establishment. But a series of interest rate increases might go down just as badly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there may be a crumb of comfort. In what are abnormal and unsettling times, Britons may find it reassuring were central bankers to do something that they are supposed to do: raise interest rates when inflation threatens to get out of control.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed's Fischer Expresses Caution About Global Housing Markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Harriet Torry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer urged global policy makers to continue efforts to strengthen the resilience of their housing markets, echoing earlier cautionary words from Fed officials about the potential risks of having low interest rates over long periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"House prices are now high and rising in several countries, perhaps as a result of extended periods of low interest rates," Mr. Fischer said in prepared remarks released ahead of delivery Tuesday at a closed-door conference on macroprudential policy hosted by the Dutch and Swedish central banks in Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Fischer said the financial system is stronger than before the recession that ended in 2009, "there is more to be done, and much improvement to be preserved and built on, for the world as we know it cannot afford another pair of crises of the magnitude of the Great Recession and the global financial crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's No. 2 official highlighted the need for a well-capitalized banking system in promoting financial stability, as well as stress tests that examine scenarios with sharp declines in house prices. Mr. Fischer didn't comment on the immediate outlook for U.S. monetary policy in his comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Fed officials have spoken out about the threat of asset price bubbles emerging due to years of low interest rates. Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren has long worried about potential bubbles in the hot commercial real-estate market. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in May that taking steps to make the financial sector more resilient is perhaps the best way to deal with asset price bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fischer said macroprudential policies that focus on borrowers, lenders and securitization may be useful in strengthening financial stability, but "even though macroprudential policies reduce the incidence and severity of housing related crises, they may still occur."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that "a well-capitalized banking system is a necessary condition for stability in bank-based financial systems as well as those with large nonbank sectors."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed's Dudley Sees More Tightening Ahead, Economy on ‘Even Keel'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By David Harrison</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLATTSBURGH, N.Y.—Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Monday a gradual pace of rate increases will help prolong the economic recovery. In remarks to a business group in upstate New York, Mr. Dudley signaled a willingness to continue the process of slowly raising interest rates as a way to keep the economy humming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we were not to withdraw accommodation, the risk would be that the economy would crash to a very, very low unemployment rate and generate inflation," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would create the risk that "we would need to slam on the brakes and generate a recession," he said. "We very much want to avoid that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dudley said the Fed was trying to strike a balance between generating economic growth without at the same time causing inflation to rise too rapidly. "The idea is to have a sustainable expansion that lasts a very long time," he said. "To do that we need to keep the economy on an even keel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So far, we've gotten the balance roughly right," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed last week raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of between 1% and 1.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After raising rates only once in both 2015 and 2016, the central bank now has put in place two rate increases in 2017. Officials also have penciled in one further rate increase this year as well as three for 2018. But some economists say sluggish inflation growth could force them to rethink their plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dudley said he was optimistic about the economy and expected inflation to gradually move up. "If the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that we'll see inflation get back to 2%," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span> chief added he wasn't concerned about the fact that Treasury yields have been falling despite the Fed's recent tightening moves. "We haven't tightened financial conditions to a significant degree," he said. "The economy hasn't been restrained very much."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't take a lot of signal from the fact that the 10-year yield is low," he said. Compared with government bond yields in Japan and Europe, U.S. yields "are actually pretty high," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks in Japan and Europe have dropped benchmark interest rates below zero and are buying bonds to stimulate their economies. The Fed, by contrast, plans this year to begin unwinding its portfolio of assets purchased in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evans Says Fed Likely Needs Time to Decide Next Rate Move</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Michael S. Derby</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans expressed support on Monday for the U.S. central bank's plan to raise rates further, but added he believes officials can take some time before acting again to ensure inflation is truly moving higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rate rises so far have been "reasonable," Mr. Evans told reporters after a speech before a gathering of the <span class="companylink">New York University</span> Money Marketeers group. But he added "I don't think we would be poorly served by allowing more time to pass and take in the data" before boosting short-term rates again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans, a voting member of the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee, was offering his first public comments since last week's gathering of the committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, officials lifted their short-term interest rate target range for the second time during the year, to 1% and 1.25%. They also said they see about one more rate rise coming over the rest of the year, in forecasts that predicted continued improvement in the labor market and a slower path back to the official 2% inflation target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's rate outlook was puzzling to some in light of recent data showing inflation trends are moving lower, rather than higher, as officials had expected. Some Fed officials have said if the pace of inflation gains doesn't accelerate it could call into question the need for rate rises later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The current environment supports very gradual rate hikes and slow preset reductions in our balance sheet," Mr. Evans said in his speech. He said he views "slow removal of accommodation as necessary support to symmetrically achieving our 2% inflation goal in a timely fashion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans declined to give a personal view on how many rate rises he believes are warranted this year. "Much ink will be spilled on the importance of two, versus three, versus four rate increases this year and subplots regarding our balance sheet policy," he said, adding, "I don't want to get hung up over small differences."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans acknowledged the Fed's inflation dilemma and he said he expects it to take longer to get inflation back to 2% relative to his colleagues. What's more, he said he sees "downside risks" to the inflation outlook, and added "we need to demonstrate a strong commitment to hitting our symmetric inflation objective sooner rather than later."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans noted that there is a lot of uncertainty around the factors that create inflation. He said "there is a host of experience" that suggest that when the job market gets hot, inflation follows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans said given what's happened with price pressures, increases in short-term rates haven't served to offer much restraint to either the economy or rising price pressures. But from here "it becomes a more difficult discussion" for central bankers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the Fed's inflation problem may be self induced. Noting the Fed's price rise target isn't a ceiling but one where prices pressures below and above the goal are equally unwelcome, he said such a regime "can be a tough policy objective for conservative central bankers to deliver on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when the public sees the Fed repeatedly fail to achieve its target, its own expectations could soften, believing inflation will always stay under the target, Mr. Evans said. That will in turn make it even harder to get inflation higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his speech, Mr. Evans was upbeat about other parts of the economy's performance. "The real economy is performing well, and we essentially have met our employment mandate," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Evans also reiterated that he believes changes in the economy mean the Fed will probably not be able to lift its interest rate target as high as it has in the past, and that means the risk of falling back to near zero rates will be higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Banks Target September for Fed's Balance-Sheet Announcement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Katy Burne</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of banks have moved up their forecasts for when the Federal Reserve will announce intentions to start its balance-sheet reduction to September from December, following Chairwoman Janet Yellen's remarks last week that the central bank could begin the process "relatively soon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts took Ms. Yellen's comments to mean that the Fed is fine-tuning the timing of its unwinding, ahead of a third interest-rate increase it has penciled in for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a May survey by the <span class="companylink">New York Fed</span>, respondents on average placed a 40% probability on the Fed announcing a change in its $4.5 trillion portfolio in the fourth quarter of this year, and a 17% likelihood for the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems like they want to prioritize the balance sheet," said Mark Cabana, interest-rate strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a former Fed official. "Rate hikes may be secondary to this next step."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Ms. Yellen's comments, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> predicted that the Fed would raise rates in September and announce changes to its bond portfolio in December. <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> also predicted a rate rise in September and the balance-sheet announcement in December. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, said the bank switched its view given Ms. Yellen's "relatively soon" comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before its latest policy meeting, the Fed had signaled in March and May minutes it likely would be appropriate to begin shrinking the portfolio later this year. Fed governor Lael Brainard said in May the time for a change in balance-sheet policy was "coming into clearer view."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The narrowing timeline comes as bond-market dynamics that made the Fed nervous in previous tightening cycles have re-emerged. When yields on longer bonds in the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> market don't rise faster than yields on short-term bonds, the pattern is called a flattening yield curve. That breakdown in the usual upward slope from short- to long-term rates is widely watched because economists say that a severe flattening, or an inversion, can signal a worsening economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's yield curve has an upward slope but is much flatter than some had expected at this point in the cycle. The gap between the yields on the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes was 0.81 percentage point Monday, close to its narrowest point since 2007 and down from 0.92 percentage point a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising long-term Treasury prices are partly a byproduct of the Fed's careful communication over its balance-sheet plans, and could be a potential problem down the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, the Fed wants to foster stable economic conditions, and has delivered messages to help ensure investors avoid dumping bonds. On the other hand, the rally in bonds has ensured that low rates have persisted on everything from mortgages to car loans, whose rates key off the 10-year Treasury note, proving a further windfall for consumers even as the Fed seeks to make sure the economy doesn't overheat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minutes to their May policy meeting showed Fed officials discussing the decline in long-term Treasury rates last month and acknowledged that recent moves to lift their federal-funds rate "had not resulted in a tightening of financial conditions."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan faced an unusual yield curve when trying to tighten financial conditions in 2004, calling the distortions a "conundrum."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts think the flattening yield curve is encouraging the Fed to address its bond portfolio sooner than later to prevent further flattening. Letting more maturing bonds roll off its portfolio instead of reinvesting in bond markets would increase available supply, causing the yields of longer- term bonds to rise as the Fed raises short-term rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analysts think the Fed's changes will increase net supply of Treasurys by 30% over the first three years, leading to a roughly 0.25 percentage point increase in rates on the 10-year Treasury note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The curve is flattening from both ends," because the Fed is raising short-term rates while rates on longer-term bonds are falling, but "the Fed won't let the yield curve invert," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mizuho Securities USA Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren Calls for Removal of 12 <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Directors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Emily Glazer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.) is urging the Federal Reserve to remove a dozen <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> board directors who served during the bank's sales-practices scandal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the letter sent to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Monday, Sen. Warren urged the Fed to invoke its authority under a rule that allows it to remove certain people associated with depository institutions under specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren pointed to 12 directors who served on the San Francisco bank's board between May 2011 and July 2015, a period in which <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> fired 5,300 employees for the bad behavior. The bank settled with two regulators and a city official in September for $185 million over the practices. Its chief executive later abruptly retired and the bank continues to face state and federal investigations, which it has said it is cooperating with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the board and its management team have "taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices." She added that the work is ongoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's board has also endured harsh criticism and faced opposition during a contentious shareholder meeting in late April. Several directors were re-elected to their roles by just a slim margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren has been a sharp critic of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s management and handling of the sales-practices scandal. When former CEO John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the problems, Sen. Warren lambasted him and said he should resign and be criminally investigated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her eight-page letter to the Fed, Sen. Warren wrote that the sales-practices scandal "revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices––problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the scandal, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s board conducted an investigation of the bank, but largely didn't fault directors. On a call with media after the report was disclosed in April, Chairman Stephen Sanger said "the findings of the investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had, when it had it" and that it hired a law firm to do the investigation to get "an independent and objective assessment of our performance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren's letter cited the Fed's ability to remove board members including if they "engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice" that caused certain depository institutions to "suffer financial loss" and that demonstrated "continuing disregard…for the safety and soundness" of the institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I urge the Federal Reserve to use the tools Congress has given it to remove the responsible Board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks," the senator's letter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 board directors mentioned in the letter are: John D. Baker II, John S. Chen, Lloyd H. Dean, Elizabeth A. Duke, Enrique Hernandez, Jr., Donald M. James, Cynthia H. Milligan, Federico F. Pena, James H. Quigley, Stephen W. Sanger, Susan G. Swenson, and Suzanne M. Vautrinot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those directors, Ms. Duke, who is now the board's vice chair, is a former Fed governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren wrote to the Fed that the board "failed to create an adequate risk management framework that would have alerted it to systemic problems with retail sales practices. It also caused long-lasting reputational damage to the bank that has eroded the bank's customer base."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's own report about the sales scandal, according to the letter, showed its "continuing disregard" for the bank's safety and soundness and failure to seriously address the sales-practices issues despite years of concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's April report largely placed blame on Mr. Stumpf and former retail-banking head Carrie Tolstedt. The board clawed back an additional $75 million in compensation from them both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was slow to stamp out the issues, the report said, in part because its decentralized structure gave Ms. Tolstedt too much power and officials from other units, such as risk management, human resources and legal, either couldn't connect the dots on problems or weren't powerful enough to do anything about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2015, board members, including then-lead independent director Mr. Sanger, pushed Mr. Stumpf to remove Ms. Tolstedt from her role. But Mr. Stumpf declined, saying that Ms. Tolstedt, while at times controlling, was "the best banker in America," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also highlighted how the bank's push to boost revenue and profit trickled down to thousands of employees who felt pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank of England Governor Sees Weak Wage Growth Delaying Rate Rises</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Paul Hannon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney on Tuesday said that while rate setters' tolerance for above-target inflation is coming to an end, it is too early to raise the key interest rate for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rescheduled speech to bankers at Mansion House in London, Mr. Carney said weak wage growth raised questions about the strength of domestic inflationary pressures, and he was unsure how the economy would respond to talks between the <span class="companylink">U.K. government</span> and the rest of <span class="companylink">European Union</span> on the terms of their separation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Carney's comments the pound fell 0.5% to $1.2674.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pound's depreciation since the June 2016 vote to leave the EU has pushed up import prices and inflation. At its meeting earlier this month, the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee voted to leave the key interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, three members dissented in favor of raising the Bank rate, the largest vote for such a move since the central bank last tightened policy in July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank rate increase," Mr. Carney said. "But all expect that any changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney voted to leave the rate unchanged, but his comments suggest he views an increase as inevitable, although possibly some months away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Arguing to wait and see how the economy will react to the Brexit negotiations—which have only just begun and will last at least two years—suggests that Carney may be prepared to delay raising rates for a long time," said Allan Monks, an economist at J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney had been scheduled to deliver his speech Thursday, but the event was postponed as a show of respect to those who died or were left homeless in the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That tragedy came amid a series of four terror attacks in as many months, and just a year after the murder of lawmaker Jo Cox led to the rescheduling of Mr. Carney's previous Mansion House speech.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The best tribute this city and this country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared commitment—whatever our differences—to promote the common good," he said. "This includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his speech, Mr. Carney also addressed the problem of large trade imbalances, which he said were now "politically as well as economically unsustainable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His proposed solution is a drive by the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> largest economies to allow trade in services to be as free as trade in goods. This, he said, would remove an impediment to economies that are more dependent on services exports—such as the U.S. and U.K.—and allow them to narrow their trade gaps with countries that are more reliant on goods exports, such as Germany and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The G-20 faces a choice—between leveling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or leveling up by liberalizing trade in services," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney estimated that "leveling up" would reduce the "excess deficits" of the U.S. by one third and the U.K. by one half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking before Mr. Carney at the Mansion House event, U.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond echoed those sentiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the U.K. to be able to share fairly in the benefits of globalization, we need to lead a global crusade for liberalization of services," he said. "And we must employ that logic in our Brexit negotiations, to agree a bold and ambitious free-trade agreement with our EU counterparts that covers both goods and services."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central banker identified the treatment of financial services in the Brexit talks, which started Monday, as an opportunity to put this new approach to trade into operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also warned against fragmenting Europe's clearing market, responding to a plan proposed by the EU's executive arm last week that would subject clearinghouses operating outside the bloc to tougher oversight, including on-site inspections and access to financial accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fragmentation is in no one's economic interest," he said. "Nor is it necessary for financial stability. Indeed it can damage it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silvana Tenreyro to Join BOE Rate-Setting Panel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Paul Hannon and Wiktor Szary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Professor Silvana Tenreyro of the <span class="companylink">London School of Economics and Political Science</span> has been appointed to the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s Monetary Policy Committee, replacing Kristin Forbes, whose term ends in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tenreyro will join the committee as an external member for a three-year term beginning July 7, the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appointment comes at a challenging time for the central bank, with inflation set to exceed its target over coming years as the pound's weakening in the wake of a 2016 vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> stokes inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am delighted to welcome Silvana Tenreyro to the Monetary Policy Committee and am very much looking forward to working with her," Gov. Mark Carney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Her extensive and varied academic experience—on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few—will be invaluable to the committee," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one recent paper, Ms. Tenreyro found evidence that monetary policy was more potent during economic expansions than contractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has made few comments on BOE policy. However, she does have experience as a rate setter, sitting on <span class="companylink">the Bank of Mauritius</span>'s MPC from 2012 to 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there, she voted for rate cuts on three occasions—in line with the majority of other rate setters on two of those times. Otherwise, she voted for rates to be left unchanged, on some occasions against a minority that wanted to raise rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over recent months, Ms. Forbes has been the most forceful advocate for a rise in interest rates at the BOE, and is regarded by analysts who follow the central bank as its leading "hawk." She was one of three members of the MPC to vote for a rise in the U.K.'s key interest rate this June, after annual inflation accelerated to 2.9% in May. This was well in excess of the BOE's 2% goal and the central bank's own forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some analysts, Ms. Forbes successor appears to show signs of what is known as "dovishness," or a predisposition to keep interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tenreyro's dovish voting behavior at <span class="companylink">the Bank of Mauritius</span> is interesting as it could point to a dovish bias of the new external MPC member, in stark contrast to her predecessor Kristin Forbes," economists at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> said in a note to clients. "However, that was a different MPC, a different time and a different country, making us very cautious in drawing any inferences."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tenreyro was awarded her Ph.D. from <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span> and worked as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston between 2002 and 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nomura analyst Jordan Rochester said her appointment suggested the BOE would be less inclined to raise rates than previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Relative to the hawkish person she is replacing...and the view that new members do not usually jump straight into a bias, we would assume a slight swing to a more dovish vote," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB Criticized for Missing Signals of Banco Popular's Troubles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Todd Buell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRUSSELS—The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s top bank supervisor on Monday faced a grilling from European lawmakers, who accused the central bank of missing signs that Spanish lender Banco Popular was struggling before it declared the institution likely to fail earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ECB's declaration triggered the sale of Banco Popular to its larger Spanish rival <span class="companylink">Banco Santander</span> for the nominal sum of €1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span>'s monetary affairs committee criticized ECB supervisory decisions and pushed for information that at times Ms. Nouy couldn't provide. On some occasions, Ms. Nouy said she couldn't answer specific questions due to confidentiality restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee's chairman, Italian Roberto Gualtieri, said he was troubled that Banco Popular was "declared fine for a long time," only to end up needing a rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nouy said a post mortem would be conducted, but that she believed her institution acted appropriately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I fail to [see] even with the knowledge that we have today, what we could have done differently," she said. "I would say we have passed the test of the framework."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comments come about two weeks after the ECB, which supervises the eurozone's largest banks, declared Banco Popular to be "failing or likely to fail." The takeover was the first test case for new European rules for resolving ailing banks without making taxpayers foot the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nouy urged lawmakers to give supervisory authorities greater power to intervene early if they felt that banks were headed in the wrong direction. She said authorities should be able to give a "strong warning to the bankers that you are taking a road that will [lead] you to resolution or liquidation if you do not make an immediate U turn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In introductory remarks Monday, Ms. Nouy expressed concern that financial firms moving to the Continent due to Brexit could exploit gaps in financial regulation there to avoid oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the supervisor was ensuring that banks moving to the Continent from the U.K. are treated in the same way regardless of the location they choose, "and that there is no leeway for arbitrage between supervisory approaches."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said, though, that there were limits to what the ECB could do "and we are concerned about that." She said that so-called options and discretions, or areas where national regulators maintain autonomy, "may now have a substantial impact in the context of Brexit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that banks coming to the eurozone "may exploit supervisory loopholes by carrying out banklike activities through an investment firm or third-country branches, both of which are not supervised at euro area level, but rather at national level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that it was "undesirable" that the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s "fragmented regulatory and supervisory framework" could play a role in a bank's decision-making process with respect to relocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Africa Central Bank Rejects Watchdog Demand to Change Mandate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Gabriele Steinhauser</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOHANNESBURG—The <span class="companylink">South African Reserve Bank</span> on Tuesday rejected a demand by the head of the country's corruption watchdog to shift its mandate away from focusing on price stability, saying the request falls outside her remit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane on Monday said that South Africa's constitution should be adapted to ensure that the central bank focuses on protecting "the socio-economic well-being of the citizens" rather than the "the value of the currency."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also said the bank should be required to regularly consult with parliament "to achieve meaningful socio-economic transformation." At the moment, that part of the constitution just required regular consultations with cabinet without the objective of changing the distribution of wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two decades after the end of apartheid, South Africa's economy remains one of the world's most unequal, with much of the country's wealth and land owned by whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mkhwebane's demand for constitutional change sent the rand currency lower and raised concern among analysts and the bank itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The amendment would, if effected, strip the Reserve Bank of its key competency to protect the value of the currency and the well understood role that central banks play in securing price stability" and undermine the bank's independence, the SARB said in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It said that the demand for changing the bank's constitutional mandate fell outside the public protector's powers and that it was ready to challenge it in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mkhwebane argued that the constitutional change was a necessary remedial action after finding that the SARB failed to recover money spent on a series of apartheid-era bailouts for Bankcorp, now part of Barclay PLC's African unit Absa. She ordered Absa repay 1.125 billion rand, a finding that Absa rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that changes to the constitution were unlikely in the near term, since they require a 2/3 majority in parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the comments form part of broader criticism of the SARB's policies, which have kept the bank's main repo rate at a high 7% for much of the past year in an effort to bring down inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The powerful <span class="companylink">Congress of South African Trade Unions</span>, which is a key ally of the ruling <span class="companylink">African National Congress</span>, has long called on the bank to move away from inflation-targeting and focus more on economic growth and job creation.</p>

<span class="companylink">Uganda Central Bank</span> Cuts Main Lending Rate</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Nicholas Bariyo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KAMPALA Uganda—<span class="companylink">Uganda's central bank</span> cut its key lending rate on Monday for the eighth consecutive time in a bid to boost sluggish economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest rate was slashed to 10% from 11% in Uganda, which is one of Africa's largest coffee exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the continued weak growth prospects, <span class="companylink">Bank of Uganda</span> judges that continued easing monetary policy is appropriate," Central Bank Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual gross domestic product growth slowed to 3.9% in the 2016-2017 fiscal year, according to the <span class="companylink">Uganda Bureau of Statistics</span>, coming in below expectations of around 5.5% growth, and down from 4.7% in 2015-2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agricultural production was curtailed by drought and private-sector credit growth was slack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's easing cycle started in April 2016 and the latest cut was in line with most analysts' expectations—despite a recent spike in inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steep food prices drove inflation in May to 7.2%—the highest level since January 2016—from 6.8% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the balance of risks to growth not improving so much, the easing mode is likely to continue," said Stephen Kaboyo, managing director with Ugandan fund manager Alpha Capital Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> expects Uganda's economic growth to rebound and reach 5.5% in 2017-18, driven by higher government spending on infrastructure. The country is expected to hike overall public spending by 10% in the fiscal year starting July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The East African country hopes its oil discoveries will also lift future economic growth. It is investing in electricity plants, railways and an oil pipeline ahead of planned oil production in 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports of coffee—Uganda's main exporting commodity—are currently rebounding, after falling by 4% to 3.32 million bags in the 2015-2016 season—the third consecutive season of decline. Shipments rose by 29% in the first seven months of the 2016-17 season, boosted by maturing plantations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Evidence for a Lower New Normal in Interest Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have long been puzzling over the causes behind the decline in interest rates since 2000, and new evidence from financial markets suggests a decline in the natural rate of interest [http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2017/june/financial-market-evidence-for-lower-natural-interest-rate-r-star/?utm_source=mailchimp&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=economic-letter-2017-06-19] has contributed about 2 percentage points to the general downward trend in yields over the past two decades. Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco researchers Jens H.E. Christensen and Glenn D. Rudebusch estimate the equilibrium real rate using only prices of inflation-indexed bonds, a financial measure that differs from estimates drawn using macroeconomic models. The issue of whether there has been a shift in the equilibrium interest rate is quite important for investors, policy makers and researchers, the authors note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets Must Grasp that the Fed is No Longer their Best Friend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets are failing to internalize the shift in the Fed's policy regime to normalize its interest rate [https://www.ft.com/content/797a800a-5278-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb] structure and balance sheet, writes Mohamed El-Erian in the Financial Times. "As such, it is more willing to ‘look through' weak growth and inflation data.," he said. Traders and investors, though, seem to be resisting the Fed's forward guidance, instead "betting on the repeat of the past few years during which officials have tended to over-estimate the extent of policy tightening." It is likely that "the central bank is now focusing more on excessive risk-taking by investors and traders, including its potential negative impact on the economy down the road."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's Poor Record on Soft Landings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's Justin Lahart notes two things investors should keep in mind about the Federal Reserve: "One, it is in a tightening cycle [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-feds-poor-record-on-soft-landings-1497890842]. Two, tightening cycles almost always end badly." The aim of the Fed's tightening policy "is to guide the economy to a soft landing," Mr. Lahart writes. "But executing a soft landing is notoriously difficult to pull off. The Fed can only guess at what the economy's just-right levels of growth and employment are, and at what level of interest rates is consistent with hitting those marks."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer urged global policy makers to continue efforts to strengthen the resilience of their housing markets, echoing earlier cautionary words from Fed officials about the potential risks of having low interest rates over long periods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"House prices are now high and rising in several countries, perhaps as a result of extended periods of low interest rates," Mr. Fischer said in prepared remarks released ahead of delivery Tuesday at a closed-door conference on macroprudential policy hosted by the Dutch and Swedish central banks in Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Fischer said the financial system is stronger than before the recession that ended in 2009, "there is more to be done, and much improvement to be preserved and built on, for the world as we know it cannot afford another pair of crises of the magnitude of the Great Recession and the global financial crisis."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's No. 2 official highlighted the need for a well-capitalized banking system in promoting financial stability, as well as stress tests that examine scenarios with sharp declines in house prices. Mr. Fischer didn't comment on the immediate outlook for U.S. monetary policy in his comments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Fed officials have spoken out about the threat of asset price bubbles emerging due to years of low interest rates. Boston Fed chief Eric Rosengren has long worried about potential bubbles in the hot commercial real-estate market. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said in May that taking steps to make the financial sector more resilient is perhaps the best way to deal with asset price bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fischer said macroprudential policies that focus on borrowers, lenders and securitization may be useful in strengthening financial stability, but "even though macroprudential policies reduce the incidence and severity of housing related crises, they may still occur."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that "a well-capitalized banking system is a necessary condition for stability in bank-based financial systems as well as those with large nonbank sectors."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fleshing Out the Trump FinReg Agenda</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week could offer an early glimpse at how the Trump administration might act on changes to financial regulation outlined in the recent Treasury Department report.  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-administration-proposes-wide-ranging-changes-to-financial-sector-regulations-1497304932]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Keith Noreika, the acting comptroller of the currency, will be the first sitting Trump regulator to testify before a congressional panel  [https://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=BC3D7D11-58DC-494C-A3B2-249267B45469] on steps policy makers can take to ease rules and foster economic growth. Mr. Noreika will appear on a panel alongside Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell and <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span> . head Martin Gruenberg , as well as two other banking regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Noreika and Mr. Powell, who is temporarily serving as the Fed's point person on financial regulation, are expected to outline their respective agencies' approaches to regulation over the coming months and years. Both have publicly backed taking a second look at postcrisis regulations to consider rolling back measures that haven't worked as intended. A key example is the Volcker rule that aims to prevent banks from making risky bets with their own money. Messrs. Noreika and Powell have expressed support for easing the rule, including by clarifying which trading activities are permitted under it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sometimes regulators need to step back and take stock and say: ‘Well, gee, what works and what was piled on?' " Mr. Noreika said in a May interview  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-volcker-rule-how-trumps-new-regulator-may-unleash-big-banks-1494495001] with The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's hearing could give both policy makers an opportunity to outline how, exactly, they are considering refashioning the rule, as well as specific changes they hope to make to other postcrisis requirements, including those outlined in the Treasury report. Meanwhile, as we reported last week, the Fed is already laying the groundwork to ease certain bank capital requirements  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-considers-easing-capital-rule-seen-as-hampering-swaps-market-1497432602] that industry officials say have hampered the swaps market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy makers also are likely to field questions on round one of the Fed's annual "stress tests," set to be released hours after Thursday's hearing. The first part will show the Fed's assessment of the banking system as a whole. A second part, set for release next week, will show whether individual banks passed or failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hearing also serves as a bellwether for assessing the likelihood that Senate lawmakers will come to any legislative agreement to roll back the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) has said he is working with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-financial-blueprint-will-help-senators-craft-regulatory-rollback-lawmaker-says-1497376722], the panel's top Democrat, on a bill that would ease requirements of Dodd-Frank and other industry regulations. Both say they are optimistic about striking a deal but haven't announced any specifics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans and Democrats in the Senate so far have been able to agree only on relatively minor changes to Dodd-Frank. Thursday's hearing could provide a progress report on their behind-the-scenes efforts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRUSSELS—The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> 's top bank supervisor on Monday faced a grilling from European lawmakers, who accused the central bank of missing signs that Spanish lender Banco Popular was struggling before it declared the institution likely to fail earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ECB's declaration triggered the sale of Banco Popular to its larger Spanish rival <span class="companylink">Banco Santander</span> for the nominal sum of €1.</p>

<span class="companylink">Barclays</span> Charged In Qatari Case</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Max Colchester and Margot Patrick</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office</span> on Tuesday filed criminal charges against <span class="companylink">Barclays PLC</span> and four former top executives linked to their handling of Middle Eastern investments that rescued the bank at the height of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case marks the first time that top executives at a U.K. bank face criminal charges for their actions during the financial crisis. If <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> is found guilty it faces a fine but wouldn't lose its banking license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SFO charged the individuals and the bank with conspiracy to commit fraud. Two individuals, including its former Chief Executive John Varley , were also charged with the provision of unlawful financial assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The allegations center on how <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> structured two capital injections from Qatari investors as the bank raised £11.8 billion ($15 billion) to prop it up during the 2008 financial market meltdown. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> said it paid £322 million in "advisory services" to Qatari investors, which wasn't initially disclosed after the capital was raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SFO's charges also relate to a $3 billion loan facility <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> made to the State of Qatar acting through the ministry of economy and finance in November 2008, just after its second capital raise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Barclays</span> said in a statement it is "considering its position in relation to these developments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike its peers <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group PLC</span> , the Middle Eastern equity injections meant <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> was able to avoid a bailout by British taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SFO's case involves a cadre of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> top executives who steered the bank at the time. Mr. Varley, who was the bank's chief executive until 2011 and Roger Jenkins, a former top investment bank executive who played a key role in orchestrating the capital raises, were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance. Thomas Kalaris, who used to run the bank's wealth division, and Richard Boath, who headed the bank's European financial institutions group, were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A law firm representing Mr. Varley said it couldn't immediately comment. Mr. Jenkins intends to vigorously defend against the charges, his lawyer, Brad Kaufman at <span class="companylink">Greenberg Traurig</span> said, adding Mr. Jenkins had received internal and external legal advice on all the matters covered in the SFO case. A spokesman for Mr. Boath said he didn't immediately have comment. Mr. Kalaris hung up the phone when asked for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under U.K. law, when the men appear at the magistrate's court, they will have the option to enter a plea. Any bail conditions will be set and prosecutors will give a brief synopsis of their case. Magistrates then decide which court will hear it. They will appear before a court in London on July 3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> case is a major test for the SFO, which has in recent years failed to successfully prosecute a number of high profile bribery and corruption cases. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May recently pledged to fold the SFO into another crime fighting agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Barclays</span> is already facing other legal problems linked to the Qatar capital raisings. In a separate probe, the U.K.'s <span class="companylink">Financial Conduct Authority</span> imposed a £50 million fine over the disclosure failures. The FCA said earlier this year that it was reviewing the case after being handed new evidence. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> is contesting the fine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. Justice Department</span> and the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> are also investigating the payments made to Middle Eastern officials. Separately PCP Capital Partners, a private-equity group, is suing <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> for $1 billion alleging it made "sham payments" to the Middle Eastern investors. PCP, which helped organize Abu Dhabi's investment in <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> in 2008, also alleges that <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> lent Qatar investors $3 billion to invest back into the bank. <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> has previously denied this.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren Calls for Removal of 12 <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Directors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Emily Glazer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.) is urging the Federal Reserve to remove a dozen <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> board directors who served during the bank's sales-practices scandal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the letter sent to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Monday, Sen. Warren urged the Fed to invoke its authority under a rule that allows it to remove certain people associated with depository institutions under specific circumstances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren pointed to 12 directors who served on the San Francisco bank's board between May 2011 and July 2015, a period in which <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> fired 5,300 employees for the bad behavior. The bank settled with two regulators and a city official in September for $185 million over the practices. Its chief executive later abruptly retired and the bank continues to face state and federal investigations, which it has said it is cooperating with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the board and its management team have "taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices." She added that the work is ongoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's board has also endured harsh criticism and faced opposition during a contentious shareholder meeting in late April. Several directors were re-elected to their roles by just a slim margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren has been a sharp critic of <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> 's management and handling of the sales-practices scandal. When former CEO John Stumpf appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the problems, Sen. Warren lambasted him and said he should resign and be criminally investigated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her eight-page letter to the Fed, Sen. Warren wrote that the sales-practices scandal "revealed severe problems with the bank's risk management practices––problems that justify the Federal Reserve's removal of all responsible Board members."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of the scandal, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> 's board conducted an investigation of the bank, but largely didn't fault directors. On a call with media after the report was disclosed in April, Chairman Stephen Sanger said "the findings of the investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had, when it had it" and that it hired a law firm to do the investigation to get "an independent and objective assessment of our performance."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren's letter cited the Fed's ability to remove board members including if they "engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice" that caused certain depository institutions to "suffer financial loss" and that demonstrated "continuing disregard…for the safety and soundness" of the institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I urge the Federal Reserve to use the tools Congress has given it to remove the responsible Board members and protect the continued safety and soundness of one of the country's largest banks," the senator's letter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 board directors mentioned in the letter are: John D. Baker II , John S. Chen , Lloyd H. Dean , Elizabeth A. Duke , Enrique Hernandez, Jr ., Donald M. James , Cynthia H. Milligan , Federico F. Pena , James H. Quigley , Stephen W. Sanger , Susan G. Swenson , and Suzanne M. Vautrinot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those directors, Ms. Duke, who is now the board's vice chair, is a former Fed governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen. Warren wrote to the Fed that the board "failed to create an adequate risk management framework that would have alerted it to systemic problems with retail sales practices. It also caused long-lasting reputational damage to the bank that has eroded the bank's customer base."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's own report about the sales scandal, according to the letter, showed its "continuing disregard" for the bank's safety and soundness and failure to seriously address the sales-practices issues despite years of concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board's April report largely placed blame on Mr. Stumpf and former retail-banking head Carrie Tolstedt . The board clawed back an additional $75 million in compensation from them both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company was slow to stamp out the issues, the report said, in part because its decentralized structure gave Ms. Tolstedt too much power and officials from other units, such as risk management, human resources and legal, either couldn't connect the dots on problems or weren't powerful enough to do anything about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2015, board members, including then-lead independent director Mr. Sanger, pushed Mr. Stumpf to remove Ms. Tolstedt from her role. But Mr. Stumpf declined, saying that Ms. Tolstedt, while at times controlling, was "the best banker in America," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also highlighted how the bank's push to boost revenue and profit trickled down to thousands of employees who felt pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals.</p>

<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> 's Plan to Revive Its Lagging Stock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Telis Demos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors want Michael Corbat to change the narrative at <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since taking the bank's helm in October 2012, Mr. Corbat's <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has played defense. It has scaled back businesses, shrunk the firm's global retail-banking footprint and wound down crisis-era assets that dragged on returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For shareholders, it has been a slog. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> 's total return has underperformed those of its biggest rivals, save for <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span> ., since Mr. Corbat arrived on the scene. The bank has yet to show it can consistently generate returns that exceed its cost of capital; in the first quarter the bank's return on common equity was a tepid 7.4%. And the stock trades at just 85% of book value, the lowest valuation of the big U.S. banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, investors, analysts and even top executives within the bank say it is time for Mr. Corbat, a former Harvard football star, to shift to offense. That means boosting growth and profitability in areas such as credit cards, Wall Street stock trading and retail banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What investors want now is to understand what's next in the story," said Conor Muldoon, fundamental portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management LLC. "What can you do to make the valuation better over time?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> is among the largest holdings in the firm's Global Value fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first test comes this week and next with the Federal Reserve's annual bank stress tests. A key indicator will be the bank's so-called payout ratio under the tests, a measure of whether it is given a green light to return more capital to shareholders than it is expected to earn in coming quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> shareholders want to see the payout ratio top 100%, meaning the bank would begin drawing down its capital pile rather than continue adding to it. If it can't do this, gains in its business won't accrue to shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming that won't be the case, investors want Mr. Corbat to boost returns over the long term by generating more profit on lagging businesses, notably the bank's consumer-lending and retail-banking arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In anticipation of this, Mr. Corbat has been honing the bank's focus, a notable change for a firm that was once a sprawling global behemoth. He and his veteran management team have done things like exit nearly two dozen retail markets globally and slash the number of corporate clients to 14,000 from 30,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is to emphasize areas with the strongest growth prospects, particularly ones in which <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has a dominant share with multinational consumers and corporations. In this vein, the bank has already said it would invest a further $1 billion to upgrade its Mexican retail bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest recent bet, though, is on credit cards, particularly for U.S. shoppers. Over the past two years, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has taken on more than $10 billion in card loans for <span class="companylink">Costco Wholesale Corp</span> ., and made other investments, such as in <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> 's proprietary reward-card offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has the biggest global card lending portfolio of any U.S. bank. Card lending now makes up 24% of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> 's total loans, nearly double that of rivals such as <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span> . and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span> ., according to analysts at Sanford Bernstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underscoring the importance of cards and the <span class="companylink">Costco</span> business, which the bank took over from <span class="companylink">American Express Corp</span> ., Mr. Corbat personally made surprise trips in December to call centers in Florence, Ky., Jacksonville, Fla., and Tucson, Ariz., according to people familiar with the trips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key point was to emphasize how critical customer service will be to get new <span class="companylink">Costco</span> -card customers, who in many cases were offered introductory rates that would expire, to become loyal users of their cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those rates and other investment in cards were a drag on the bank's retail performance of late. While corporate and investment banking was at or near return targets last year, consumer banking generated a roughly 13% return against a 20% target, Mr. Corbat said recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> is counting on the profitability of the card business to pick up meaningfully in the second half of this year as the initial investment period winds down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Corbat and other executives are expected to provide greater detail for these plans when the bank in July holds an investor day—its first in nearly a decade. At this, he also will have to fight the view among some investors and analysts that <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> lacks a unifying strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's consumer and corporate businesses are like "two boats floating in the ocean, not tied to each other," said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. In the past, he has called for the bank's breakup, though Mr. Kleinhanzl says he is now waiting to see how <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> fares amid rising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investor day will give Mr. Corbat "the chance to lay out the new strategy," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTSE Russell Index Considers Booting Firms With Lots of Non-Voting Shares</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Richard Teitelbaum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A proposal being floated by a large index firm could force finance chiefs at companies like <span class="companylink">Alphabet Inc</span> ., <span class="companylink">Facebook Inc</span> . and <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span> . to choose between keeping their places in broad stock benchmarks or changing their share class structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTSE Russell is proposing possible restrictions on the inclusion of companies with unequal voting rights in its indexes, but the firm will weigh input from clients and investors before working out specifics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal calls for setting a minimum threshold for the percentage of voting control attached to company shares in an index. For example, a company whose Class A shares in an index control 40% of the total votes might be excluded from FTSE Russell's main indexes, like the Russell 3000 or Russell 2000, if the threshold were higher than that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTSE Russell gave until Friday to respond to its proposal. A spokesman said it expects to release a decision sometime in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm asked for feedback on what the threshold might be. It also said it might ultimately decide not to change FTSE Russell rules at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the proposal is addressing a corporate governance issue viewed as important to some key investors. "The future of the markets are at stake," said James Andrus, an investment manager at the <span class="companylink">California Public Employees' Retirement System</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many institutional investors have grown increasingly critical of unequal voting rights. For example, organizations including the Council of Institutional Investors, an advocacy group, have called for nonvoting shares to be banned from indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether barring companies with unequal voting rights from indexes would prompt them to opt for a different share class structure when going public is uncertain. "The answer would depend on how restrictive [the ban is], that is how many indexes we were excluded from," said Fitbit Inc. Chief Financial Officer Bill Zerella in an email. "We would have to weigh that with the benefits of a dual class."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Fitbit</span> went public in 2015 with Class A shares entitled to one vote and Class B shares entitled to 10 votes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All things being equal, companies that are shifted from popular indexes are likely to see their share prices fall because investors who track the benchmark are no longer required to hold the stock in question. "There are some studies that show it could make a 15% difference," Mr. Andrus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTSE Russell and two rivals began considering the issue of nonvoting share classes after the March initial public offering of <span class="companylink">Snap Inc</span> ., whose Class A shares carry no voting rights. The new FTSE Russell proposal broadens that to other kinds of unequal voting shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the fact that FTSE Russell described a system using thresholds to limit the inclusion of shares with unequal voting rights suggests the firm is likely to do something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think there's a high likelihood that one of these thresholds will be implemented," said Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager at the <span class="companylink">California State Teachers' Retirement System</span> . "The question is what the threshold will be."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTSE Russell estimated the percentage of voting power held by the public of selected companies that have shares with unequal voting rights. By the firm's estimates, 38.64% of Alphabet's voting power is represented by the shares included in its main indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> , 30.27% of total votes are represented by the shares in its main indexes and 59.64% for <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alphabet and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> didn't respond to emails seeking comment on the proposal or FTSE Russell's estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Ford spokesman referred to a section of the company's 2017 proxy statement that says, "Our ownership structure has helped insulate our Company from business cycles and related short-term pressures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of unequal voting rights are likely to applaud restrictions. "The mere fact that they are considering keeping nonvoting shares out of the index is a good thing," said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen Smith, co-founder of investment firm Renaissance Capital LLC, said excluding dual voting class companies may result in leaving out superior stock-market performers. "This could be a minefield," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FTSE Russell, which is owned by <span class="companylink">London Stock Exchange Group PLC</span> , solicited suggestions on what kinds of restrictions should be applied to companies that fail to meet the threshold. All of a company's securities might be excluded or just nonvoting shares, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm also sought input on how new restrictions should be applied. The thresholds could be applied at the next review, for example, or existing constituents could be grandfathered into the indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rival index firms S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices and <span class="companylink">MSCI Inc</span> . also have launched reviews concerning the inclusion of companies with nonvoting shares in their indexes. An S&amp;P spokeswoman said the firm would complete its consultations with market participants on June 30 and announce its decision soon after.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An MSCI spokeswoman didn't return requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Virtual Currency War That Threatens to Tear Bitcoin Apart</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Paul Vigna</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A calcifying rift in the bitcoin world is pitting two camps with competing visions for what the virtual currency should be against each other, accentuating the volatility that has come to define this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for bitcoin, though, last week was a wild ride. It rose to a high of $3,018, only to fall 27%. The currency then recovered somewhat and by Tuesday was trading at $2,650.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp swings followed bitter jousting by bitcoin developers and businesses over how best to expand the currency's processing capacity and could result in it being split into separate, competing coins. On one side: those who want bitcoin to act more like a digital version of gold, a commodity with a limited supply that can be held as a store of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposing camp wants bitcoin to look more like a currency, a unit that can be used to settle transactions. That faction wants bitcoin to be as fast and easy to trade as a dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sides have been at a stalemate, but new proposals coming this summer could provide a breakthrough—either changes in the bitcoin network's processing capacity or a split between a high-speed and slow-speed bitcoin. "You watch a fine marriage that is falling apart," says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who studies virtual currencies. "Eventually, you say, I think a divorce is the best thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bickering has hindered interest in the virtual currency, sending some to a newer alternative, <span class="companylink">Ethereum</span> , that has surged more than fortyfold this year and is now worth only about 20% less than all the traded bitcoin, according to CoinMarketCap.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of my friends are selling their bitcoin and buying ethereum," says Zachary Mallard, who runs a men's grooming-products business in Brooklyn, N.Y. Mr. Mallard bought some ethereum in recent months, passing up on bitcoin in part because he views the potential split in the currency as limiting the potential gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate between the two sides has intensified in recent weeks, as bitcoin has rallied more than 160% this year—and that is despite the recent swings in the currency's value. Ultimately, how the trading is structured will help determine who controls the increasingly valuable currency, and who potentially gets rich from that control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it was developed in 2008 by the pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin has a limited supply, 21 million coins, that are released on a set schedule and awarded to businesses that confirm transactions in a process known as "mining."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The network it trades on was designed to be fast and cheap, operating without middlemen, with an immutable ledger recording transactions. The ledger, also known as blockchain, was simultaneously transparent to users and protective of the identity of buyers and sellers, some of whom historically used bitcoin for money laundering or other illegal purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Briefly, this is how bitcoin trades: individual transactions on the network are packed into blocks by companies that specialize in processing the trades, so-called "miners." Under its current structure, the size of those blocks is capped, allowing only about seven transactions per second, far below the hundreds of thousands a network like Visa can process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bitcoin's early days, the limit wasn't an issue. That has changed as bitcoin transactions have surged and the currency has piqued more widespread curiosity. The result has been bottlenecks and rising transaction fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors and processors have pushed to increase the limits in an effort to make bitcoin trade more like a modern-day currency. But purists and some developers have fought back, in part because it could hurt their financial interests but also because it goes against their libertarian, anti-big business bent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With past efforts at compromise between the two sides failing, "we've reached the point now where we accept that it's a possibility" that the factions will go their separate ways, said Eric Lombrozo, one of bitcoin's leading developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a prominent bitcoin mining company, BitMain, released a plan to alter bitcoin's underlying software that would result in two live versions at the same time. There are other proposals as well that would have the same effect. It isn't clear which if any will be adopted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On paper, everybody seems to be in favor of raising the capacity limits. In practice, there are two sides starkly divided over how to do that. One group, led by businesses, wants to raise the size limit for all bitcoin trading. The other, led by developers, wants to create what is essentially another, subordinate network for processing transactions quickly. This option would leave the current main network unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People involved in the fight say the fate of bitcoin may become clearer in the next two months as owners and miners vote on the various proposals to break the logjam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arching over all of this is the question of who ultimately controls bitcoin. "Why is it so acrimonious?" Mr. Gun Sirer asked. "It isn't about the parameters, it's not about the block size. This is about voice."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is putting the final touches on a process to design a bail-in regime for Canada's big banks to reduce the risk for taxpayers should a lender get in trouble. Finance Department released proposals for consideration, and stakeholders can respond until July 17. Key element is Canada proposes that tradeable or transferable senior unsecured debt issued after the implementation date and with an initial term greater than 400 days will be subject to bail-in regime. Under bail-in regime, authorities can convert some of a failing bank's debt into common shares in order to recapitalize the bank and help restore it to viability. BMO Capital says proposal is largely in line with expectations, and believes bail-in securities will end up being a bit more expensive than legacy senior unsecured securities.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large retail holdings of subordinated bank debt in Italy wouldn't be enough to prevent a bail-in of troubled banks' creditors, ABN Amro strategist Tom Kinmonth says. Nevertheless, Italian authorities could still try to compensate ‘mom-and-pop' investors via exchanges for senior debt or through a compensation fund. Therefore, even though retail holdings couldn't prevent a bail-in, they could reduce its benefit to failing lenders, the strategist adds.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The MSCI index will decide Tuesday  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/your-etf-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-1497889558] whether to include Chinese domestic stocks in the benchmark emerging markets index, a decision that could lead to hundreds of billions of dollars eventually being invested there. Its latest plan is to dilute the weight of China's domestically listed A shares to cater to the needs of index trackers, which makes sense as an investing algorithm. But that supposed benchmark is neither a sensible measure of what's happening in emerging markets, because China's weight is too small, nor a useful tool for big investors who have secured preferential access to the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bundesbank</span> paper, researchers Natalia Tente, Natalja von Westernhagen and Ulf Slopek present a framework  [http://bit.ly/2sM6aup] for setting capital requirements that takes systemic credit risk into account. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, banking supervisors developed approaches such as stress testing to tame the risks of banking system failure. The researchers illustrate how the framework may be put into place using German banks and three stress scenarios. "Based on the results, we argue that the actual capital levels and the capital needs calculated with additional regard to systemic credit risk may differ considerably."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diversity's Role in Reducing Risk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narcissistic biases can lead employers and regulators to favor those who have similar backgrounds or other common bonds, and that inevitably affects the quality of hiring and risk-management decisions, Andrew Waxman writes in an opinion piece for American Banker  [http://bit.ly/2sI3ddA]. Mr. Waxman, an associate partner in IBM Global Business Services' financial markets risk and compliance practice, says financial institutions should pay particular attention to such biases in situations that can put the entire company at risk, such as on a trading desk. "For regulators and stakeholders, the concern is that examiners are not objectively scrutinizing institutions if their contacts reflect their own backgrounds," he adds. Improving diversity on teams and within the institution as a whole is critical to combating such biases, Mr. Waxman writes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the U.S. will get a read on the housing market with existing- and new-home sales releases, a number of Federal Reserve officials will give their first public comments following the central bank's decision to raise interest rates, and a purchasing managers index could show the eurozone economy lost some of its momentum in June.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: U.S. May existing-home sales data from the National Association of Realtors is expected to show a 0.4% decline, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home construction declined for the third straight month in May, signaling a softening in home building at a time of tight supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts dropped 5.5% in May from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.092 million, the Commerce Department said Friday [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. May's figure carries a margin of error of 11.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plunge in starts last month was led by continued weakness in multifamily construction, but single-family starts were lower as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A shortage of construction workers may be weighing on the construction industry, and in some parts of the country short supply of land to build on is also a factor," said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, looking past month-to-month fluctuations, starts in the first five months of the year were up 3.2%. Residential building permits, an indication of how much construction is in the pipeline, increased 5.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the month, permits fell 4.9% to an annual pace of 1.168 million. Permits last month were down 10.4% for buildings with multiple units and down 1.9% for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-builder confidence slipped this month but remained high historically, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Thursday. Builders are expressing concern over a shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Ugalde, president of Connecticut-based builder T&amp;M Building Co. Inc., said home builders are looking at smaller land options, given the tight availability of subdivisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the other builders now that used to pick up these subdivisions of up to 50 lots don't have as great an opportunity anymore," Mr. Ugalde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of inventory comes in concert with rising demand, particularly from millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Part of the problem is we're benefiting from a demographic tailwind of millennial housing demand," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. "When a millennial moves out of the parents' proverbial basement, the need for a new housing unit is created."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a home in April was $244,800, up 6% from a year earlier. Wednesday's decision by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates could ultimately also help nudge mortgage rates higher.</p>

U.S. Government Bonds Hold Firm Despite Fed Tightening; After drifting slightly higher overnight, yields snapped back following an unexpected fall in housing starts</span>
</div><div class="author">By Sam Goldfarb </div><div>432 words</div><div>16 June 2017</div><div>15:59</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond market ended an eventful week on a quiet note Friday, with yields holding roughly flat after declining earlier in week in response to soft inflation data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.157%, compared with 2.160% Thursday and 2.201% the previous Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After drifting slightly higher overnight, yields snapped back Friday morning after new data showed an unexpected decline in housing starts. Overall, it was a fairly uneventful session, a possible sign of things to come given a lack of major economic data for the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors and analysts now say that the direction for Treasury yields will be largely dictated by inflation data. In light of recent reports, many investors doubt the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will be able to follow through on its plan of raising interest-rates at least once more this year. Further signs that inflation is stuck below the Fed's 2% target would bolster this skepticism, leading to lower Treasury yields, while stronger data would have the opposite effect, investors and analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past week, the bond market staged a major rally in response to the latest lackluster inflation reading. An announcement from the Fed that it was raising short-term interest-rates and sticking with its tightening plan for the rest of the year only led to a partial retracement of the initial move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, inflation data is "the only real catalyst" that could substantially alter the market, said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager of BMO TCH Core Plus Bond Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Fed officials have argued that the recent downturn was likely caused by temporary factors, "the market is viewing it as more of a challenge," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One gauge of inflation expectations, the 10-year break-even rate, which measures the yield premium on the 10-year Treasury note relative to the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, has dropped in recent weeks. On Friday, it implied investors expect an annual inflation rate of 1.676% over the next 10 years, down from 1.819% on May 31, according to <span class="companylink">Tradeweb</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to influencing monetary policy, inflation poses a direct threat to government bonds by chipping away their fixed returns over time. As a result, bond prices tend to go up when inflation expectations go down.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen </div><div>849 words</div><div>16 June 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affluent home buyers, desperate for inventory in the hottest markets, are giving a fresh look to bank-owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Savvy buyers could be rewarded with a discounted luxury home in a posh neighborhood. But they also could be stepping into a money pit with legal snarls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a risk more buyers are willing to take. "Everyone is just chasing whatever it is that's coming online," said Matthew Gardner, chief economist for Seattle-based brokerage Windermere Real Estate. He says the appeal of these post-foreclosure homes, often called real-estate owned, or REO, properties, has grown because of tight inventory in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Having those three letters [REO], it used to be a huge anchor on the property, but now it propels it," said Danny Hertzberg, an agent with the Jills Group of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> in Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, he sold Villa Katerina, a 10,383-square-foot, six-bedroom Spanish Colonial on the water in Miami Beach, for $8.7 million, about 6% below asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says local buyers today can expect about a 10% discount on luxury bank-owned properties, when just a few years ago 20% to 30% was common, amid a glut of distressed properties available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BridgeInvest, an asset-management firm focused on real-estate lending in the southeastern states and Texas, was the seller. Ian Glaser, a partner at the firm, said they sold the villa at a "fire sale" price, because they're not in the business of holding real estate. Last year, he said, the home was appraised for about $13 million. He wouldn't name the buyer, but said the buyer plans to live in the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most REOs break even or turn a profit, he said, because their value now exceeds outstanding debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory even for these distressed properties is tight. In April, 734,996 properties were in some stage of foreclosure, down about 66% from a peak 2.2 million in 2010, said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of Attom Data Solutions. Meanwhile, million-dollar homes made up 2.06% of all REO sales in 2016 -- the largest share in three years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an analysis of 20 metro areas with the most distressed properties for sale over $750,000, including bank-owned homes, the median sales price was $932,500, 3.4% lower than the sales price of nondistressed homes in those markets, stated research firm Clear Capital. The biggest discount for luxury distressed properties was in the greater Dallas area, where they sold for a median 13% below asking price, In San Jose, Calif., they sold for 0.5% above list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some rare finds. In Cohasset, Mass., a seaside town about an hour south of Boston, one lender is selling an REO castle. Built in 1930, the 7,540-square-foot French Norman-style home fell into foreclosure in 2014, says listing agent Brian Gagnon of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>. He listed the home, which is vacant, for $1.2 million in May; it was listed in 2010 for just under $3 million. "I wish there were more of these," said Mr. Gagnon, who gets approached by lenders to sell one or two REOs of this caliber a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a luxury REO can present unusual obstacles. Mary Lou Castellanos, an agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, was listing a $1.795 million four-bedroom home in Oakland, Calif., that was repossessed by the lender and had been sitting vacant. She was in escrow with a buyer when she received a voicemail from someone claiming her "services were no longer needed." Two days later, she discovered the home was being occupied by an anarchist group claiming ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I felt like I was in an episode of 'Law and Order,'" said Ms. Castellanos, who, with the help of the police, forced the group out. The home sold in March for $1.46 million, about 19% below the original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers willing to put up with extra hassles are sometimes rewarded. In Maui, a 4,700-square-foot home with an ocean view sat vacant for nearly a decade after being repossessed. When it finally came on the market late last year for $3 million, the family of Alex Iskenderian was ready to pounce, said Mr. Iskenderian, 27, an agent and co-owner of BHHS Maui Properties. They made a full-price offer the day it was listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, a title report showed unpaid property-tax claims and other liens. Damage was found during inspection. After delays, the price was renegotiated to $2.86 million. "There was a lot of complexity," said Sid Kirkland, who brokered the deal for the buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total net worth of U.S. households climbed by $2.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2017, reaching a record $94.8 trillion as the stock market soared and home prices climbed in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household wealth in the stock market climbed [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/global-markets-quiet-ahead-of-u-k-elections-1496889599] by $1.3 trillion in the quarter, showing just how much the market's climb to Dow 20000 [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/dow-closes-above-20000-for-first-time-1485378466] and beyond has created a swell of wealth on American's investment statements that is helping underpin consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are from a quarterly Federal Reserve report [https://www-federalreserve-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/releases/z1/current/], known as the Flow of Funds, that tracks the aggregate wealth of all U.S. households and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that the value of household real estate rose by about $500 billion in the quarter, reflecting a continuing increase in national home prices. The sum Americans held in savings accounts rose by about $100 billion in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household debts increased by about $46 billion in the quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $2.3 trillion increase, though large, isn't without precedent. Such large increases were seen in the late 1990s when the stock market was also climbing rapidly, and in 2004 when both markets and home prices were climbing. The last time wealth increased so rapidly was late 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2007-09 recession, when the housing market and stock market both fell, households lost nearly $12 trillion in wealth. But in recent years, households in aggregate have regained that wealth and more as first the stock market, and then the housing market [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-home-prices-set-a-record-in-september-case-shiller-says-1480428083], began to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. has about 126 million households, meaning the average net worth of U.S. households is about $750,000. The report provides no details of how that wealth is distributed between households. The figures aren't adjusted for inflation.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Julie V. Iovine </div><div>1036 words</div><div>6 June 2017</div><div>17:12</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six decades after his death, Frank Lloyd Wright is still the most famous architect in America—a publishing house favorite despite library shelves already sagging with thousands of Wright-themed tomes, and the name most often invoked by members of the public asked to recall any architect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the prospect of a major exhibition at <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span> celebrating the architect's sesquicentennial would not necessarily generate much excitement among architects and architecture buffs. And one bearing the title "Frank Lloyd Wright at 150: Unpacking the Archive" might even induce a bit of dread, particularly in light of the fact that some 500,000 pieces of paper are said to be in the archive, now jointly owned by MoMA and <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that would be a mistake. "Unpacking the Archive" is not only an illuminating cross-section of intriguing items underpinning the creation of major works of architecture but also a glimpse into MoMA's evolving approach to art exhibitions—by taking an oblique and selective approach rather than surveying major milestones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reconfigured third-floor galleries atop the refurbished and extended <span class="companylink">Bauhaus</span> staircase—the completed first phase of the museum's ambitious Diller Scofidio + Renfro expansion (details of what comes next were announced last week)—a team of guest historians and in-house curators have been let loose in the archive under the direction of Barry Bergdoll, a MoMA curator in the department of architecture and design and a Columbia University art history professor, and Jennifer Gray, a project research assistant at the museum. Each was asked to pick one or more artifacts from the archive and build a story, an argument or revelation around the selection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is not a show that will trace the career of the architect or explain Wright's masterworks as such exhibitions often do. It does, however, succeed at pumping some vitality back into a reputation bleached of urgency by overexposure to Robie House silk ties, Coonley Playhouse stained-glass coasters and other Wright-themed merchandise. Mr. Bergdoll has called the 12 sections "Madeleine moments" in that they aim to unleash, as did Proust's sugary nibble, a few intensely vivid new impressions of this most thoroughly examined genius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exhibition is organized along a central spine where an appetizer portion of Wright's greatest and weirdest hits is featured. It ranges from the famous richly hued, below-the-falls perspective of Fallingwater with which Wright seduced his client, Edgar Kaufmann Jr., into approving a daring cantilever design whose construction details had not yet been figured out to a pencil sketch of the wacky Gordon Strong Automobile Objective and Planetarium Project (1924-25), a gigantic roadside whirligig. But there are also surprises, specifically the Meteor Crater Inn project (1948), a faceted stone tower shooting off-kilter over the crater's edge in Arizona that could have been designed by an upstart architect today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rooms branching off this central gallery neatly contain the 12 "stories" triggered by archive objects. In one, we can examine the contents of a presentation record—Wright's own commemorative portfolio of photos and plans—of one of the architect's most ambitious projects: the <span class="companylink">Imperial Hotel</span> (1913-23) in Tokyo. It is a particularly rare find as it represents a complete record of the finished building as Wright himself never saw it. The hotel famously survived the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 but was subsequently demolished in winter 1967/68. The photos and plans in the album (with Wright's name misspelled on the cover) attest to the hotel's grandiosity. One black-and-white image, showing snow on a tree in a courtyard, seems composed to suggest the woodblock prints of the 19th-century artist Hiroshige, a Wright hero. Nearby, a site plan marks the spot from which Wright wanted every photo taken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another section analyzes Wright's distinctively stylized drawings. Created by staff members in his office, there are some 55,000 in the archive. Janet Parks of Columbia's Avery Library was able to identify the hand of Marion Mahony, one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., on some of the famous Prairie House drawings that remain among his finest. Wright himself, it seems, liked to add the bushes and greenery around the edges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are interesting polemics, as in Princeton professor Spyros Papapetros's contention that Wright embedded ornament so deeply into his designs not only to make the whole sublimely organic but also to make sure that clients would not be able to eliminate expensive details. Mr. Bergdoll shows how Wright cooked up the notorious Mile-High super-tower in the 1950s as a press stunt in Chicago to upstage the imperious modernist Mies van der Rohe, who the 89-year-old Wright thought was stealing his thunder. But in a section on Wright's landscapes based on some rare plans for plantings—including for the Darwin Martin House in Buffalo—the argument that his admixtures of indigenous and exotic plants suggests "ongoing horticultural debates tied up with larger issues surrounding race, immigration, and belonging" sounds like a revisionist stretch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sections draw a bead on a model for a farm-to-market concept; a little-known 1928 rendering for a rural school project for African-American children; Wright's ideas about pre-fabricated building systems; and the architect's attraction to circles as the ultimate harmonious form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all his extreme popularity, Wright is not a hot topic among contemporary scholars, and architecture students rarely look hard past his early Prairie Houses. This show shakes things up. In short explanatory videos attached to each gallery (for once, well worth watching), the various historians—many not even Wright scholars—share the details of their explorations with a palpable sense of excitement. Their enthusiasm is rightly contagious.</p>

Riksbank Chief Wants Swedish Government to Cool Red-Hot Property Market; Central bank chief complains of ‘too much complacency' in Swedish politics</span>
</div><div class="author">By Nina Adam </div><div>733 words</div><div>1 June 2017</div><div>04:47</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden's central bank governor Stefan Ingves said a red-hot housing market and record-high level of household debt will put the Scandinavian country's economy in peril unless the government cools the property sector down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There has been too much complacency" in Swedish politics, Mr. Ingves said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in which he called for Stockholm to set limits on borrowing for home purchases or impose new property taxes among other possible measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span>'s standoff with the government echoes similar debates about the division of responsibility for cooling asset prices ahead of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, and in the aftermath of the crisis, central bankers argued that interest rates  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/why-rallying-bank-stocks-should-worry-the-fed-1493829618]were too blunt an instrument with which to deflate overheating housing markets, and that they were in any case constrained by their primary goal of stabilizing inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the crisis, regulators have focused on a new set of "macroprudential" tools—such as limits on the size of mortgages relative to income—as the best way of nipping bubbles in the bud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Swedish property prices have soared in recent years, fueled by low borrowing costs and strong economic growth. The <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> estimates that house prices have doubled and apartment prices have tripled over the past 10 years. At the same time, household debts have risen to 180% of disposable incomes, which is a record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> earlier this month attached about a 35% chance to a housing bust in Sweden over the next five to eight quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ingves appears concerned, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our housing market is kind of going through an episode where people tend to say ‘this time is different', and it rarely is," he said, speaking during a visit to Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market "is completely out of equilibrium" and households are borrowing "way too much," Mr. Ingves said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> he leads has set its key interest rate at a record low  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/swedens-riksbank-cuts-bond-buying-program-leaves-repo-rate-unchanged-1493281705]of minus 0.5%, and in April decided to extend its bond-buying program until the end of the year, arguing those measures are needed to meet its 2% inflation target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ingves says the central bank lacks the tools to curb the housing boom, since it is constrained by the low global interest rates that are the result of policies pursued by the monetary authorities in some of in the world's biggest economies [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-should-prepare-to-reduce-dose-of-monetary-medicine-1496239349], notably the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> in the eurozone. Were the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> to raise its policy interest rate in response to the boom, the national currency would likely strengthen, hurting exports and lowering inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a small open economy with free capital flows, the real rate of interest is set in the global market," he said. "It is just like sailing a small boat on the ocean. When the big guys move, it is going to affect you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the central bank lacks the tools to tackle growing problems in the housing market, the government has more power to respond. One option is a limit on the amount of debt a home buyer can take on relative to their income. That is a path already taken by the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> and the <span class="companylink">Central Bank of Ireland</span>, but one that the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> doesn't have the authority to take, though the government could grant Sweden's financial supervisor, FI, the authority to do so. Alternatively, or in combination, the government could raise the property tax, and reduce or eliminate tax breaks on mortgage interest payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Somebody has to take away the punchbowl," Mr. Ingves said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the FI said Wednesday that it wants to introduce a stricter amortization requirement for new mortgage holders who take out large loans. The new rules also require governmental approval, according to a FI spokesman.​</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank for International Settlements</span> and others have warned that a long period of very low global interest rates could lead to a fresh cycle of boom and bust in housing markets. While that seems like a distant prospect in many parts of the world, Sweden may be an early test of how much has changed since the last financial crisis.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Ingves, Sweden's central bank governor, was interviewed by The Wall Street Journal's Nina Adam at the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> in Frankfurt on Tuesday, May 30, 2017. Mr. Ingves, who is also chairman of the <span class="companylink">Basel Committee on Banking Supervision</span>, discussed the buildup of risks in Sweden's financial sector because of a red-hot housing market and record-high household indebtedness. He also spoke about negative interest rates and banking regulation, among other topics. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NINA ADAM: Basically, given your vast experience in central banking, also financial regulation – you've just been talking about it – it must be very hard for you to watch the current buildup of risks in the Swedish banking system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEFAN INGVES: Well, yeah, in the – in the sense that for many, many years I've talked about the imbalances in the Swedish housing market, and we have not handled our housing market well at all. And that's, of course, a problem in itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then that has to be combined with the fact that, in a small, open economy with free capital flows, basically the real rate of interest is set in the global market in one way or the other. And that means that real rates are low. Real rates are low globally, and we sort of import those low real rates. And that, of course, means that the housing market at the same time is completely out of equilibrium. That creates a difficult environment because global rates, they are what they are – we can't change that because you can't do that in a small, open economy – while at the same time our households are borrowing way too much. And that means that you need to make it more expensive for the households to borrow one way or the other, but at the same time the political process has been such that Swedish politicians have not given the central bank any tools at all to deal with that issue. So basically they have ensured that dealing with the housing market is pretty much reserved for the politicians themselves, and in this field they are just behind schedule and don't want to do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: OK. You just mentioned the housing market and the problems there. If nothing gets done about it, do you think Sweden could be on the verge of another housing crisis or even a banking crisis?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, that's, of course, always impossible to know. But certainly the risks are going up all the – all the time because the more debt you accumulate, the higher the risk of a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, compared to many other countries, we're of course a bit different in the sense that we have had for 20, 25 years a very large current account surplus, and that gives us some safety. The debt-to-GDP [gross domestic product] ratio on the public-sector side is low. It's actually very low compared to many, many countries in Europe. I don't have the exact number now, but say around 35 percent of GDP, something like that. But, on the other hand, household debt is the highest it has ever been, so in one way one can say that when we brought down the public-sector debt to a very low level the other side of the coin is that household-sector debt, and corporate-sector debt for that matter, went up instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Well, you said that in a way the Swedish economy is shielded because of a relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio and a sizable current account surplus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Still, don't you think that foreign investors should watch out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, given what's going on in our housing market, it's kind of going through an episode where people tend to say that this time is different, and it rarely is. So eventually we'll end up with some issues in the housing sector, one way or the other. It doesn't necessarily mean that we'll end up with a huge problem in the banking sector because, given the way our legal framework operates, banks have double recourse, first to the house and then to people's income. But certainly if there were to be a problem, and particularly if interest rates go up – which they eventually will do, one way or the other – then it's more likely that we would end up with a macro problem because households will have to cut back on consumption. And when they do so, then, of course, growth would be lower than what it otherwise would be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a bad scenario is kind of well-known in some sense. Whether a bad scenario really will happen or not, that we don't know. But risks do go up. And given that debt to disposable income right now is around 180 and going up, up, up, and we have roughly around 70 percent of the mortgages are variable-rate mortgages with very, very long amortization periods compared to many other parts of the world, those are serious issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Well, then, against this background, do you think that the government and the financial regulatory authority are simply too complacent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, certainly on the – on the political side there has been too much complacency. The thing is slowing moving forward in the sense that if you go, let's say, five years back, many would have argued that this is not a problem at all. Today it's generally accepted that our housing market is a problem. So, in that sense, it's a step forward. And now the issue is rather on the political side what to do, compared to just more or less denying that this is a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the regulatory side, we are slowly getting there in the sense that our FSA [Financial Supervisory Authority doesn't] have the regulatory powers that they would need to have, in our view, when it comes to, let's say, macroprudential issues. But there is a lawmaking process going on to give them more powers than what they have had in the past, so it's sort of slowly moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first you have to have the legal powers; then, second, you also have to use them. And here the legal framework, the way it appears to end up now is in such a construction that the FSA will only have the right to suggest, but the ultimate decisions will be done by the government in one way or the other. So the jury is still out whether the government or future governments will be ready to actually decide when the time comes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Against this backdrop, wouldn't it be much better that you would be given more tools, and that you can immediately use those tools to kind of ease tensions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, I have publicly argued in the past that it would have been better for the central bank to have been given some macroprudential tools. And, given the independence of the central bank, my personal view is that it's highly likely that we also would have used those tools. But the political process has been such that it went in the other direction because ultimately, given the way things have evolved in my country, it's clear that the politicians have a preference for deciding themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: But what kind of tools should be in your toolbox?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, we can always argue about the tools, but most of them are actually fairly well-known, like loan-to-value ratios, loan-to-income ratios, amortization requirements, risk weights on mortgages, and things like – things like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: And if these tools are not being given to you, what are the risks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, I mean, as long as – as long as household debt goes up, up, up, and as long as household debt is growing faster than the increase in disposable income, then basically households end up with more debt tomorrow than they had yesterday. And at the same time, we have all sorts of structural issues in our housing market. So, basically, construction has been too low for many, many years. We have rent controls and we have numerous other issues of the type "not in my backyard," as they say in the U.K., when it comes to zoning restrictions and things like that. But this is – today it's commonly understood and accepted that we have all these issues and that this is a problem. And as I said before, that's a step forward, but now the next phase would be how to actually do something about it. And that has been pretty hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: How likely is it that something is going to be done? Because you said it's very important that something gets done. And what does it take?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: I think that, given that – this will be a slow process. It probably will take many years. But now it has also become clearer to many that the housing market is not only an issue about the financial sector and households borrow a lot of money, it's also an issue – it has also become a structural issue, because lack of housing has become an impediment when it comes to moving to the major cities, for example. And given the shortages of housing and given the structural change that is – that we sort of regularly in a small, open economy go through, then a sufficient supply of housing has to go with it because otherwise you have a – you have a problem. And if you don't solve that problem, the only way for prices in the housing market is just to go up, up, up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: But this sounds like a longer-term fix, really.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Yeah, it is. It is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: And do you need something more imminent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: There are many different parts to it because there are a whole host of issues dealing with the supply of housing, and then you have other issues dealing with the demand for housing. And the demand for housing has something to do with the – how much you need to borrow or how easy it is to borrow if you're a household.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also fiscal issues that affect this, because one such fiscal issue is, for example, interest rate deductibility, because today you can deduct interest for tax purposes. And that, in my view, should have been done away with a long time ago, but that seems to be also difficult to deal with. Another issue on the fiscal side is that basically we have a flat property tax, which is pretty much more or less the same for most people. And when prices then go up, up, up, that type of a property tax becomes highly regressive because people pay more or less – more or less the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the issue is not only about macroprudential issues, it's also about other issues. But generally speaking one can say that the less you do on the fiscal side and the less you do on the supply side, in order to have the whole thing not ending up in a huge problem, the more you have to do on the financial-sector side, kind of putting a Band-Aid in one corner. And that we just talk about constantly on the central bank side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: To me it sounds like there's a huge party going on in Sweden and nobody wants to spoil it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: It's well understood that the party is there, and then you run into a common problem world-wide that somebody has to take away the punch bowl. And when that is not happening, the music keeps playing and people keep dancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: OK. But on the other hand, the repo rate in Sweden is at a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: It's minus 0.5 percent. At the same time, you have just decided to extend your QE [quantitative easing] until the end of the year. Isn't, in that respect, the central bank partly to blame for the buildup of risks in the financial system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, you can – of course, in the sense that rates are low, but one needs to be mindful of the fact that inflation has been low for way too long. So it has been an issue, like in many other countries, how to get inflation up, and we have an inflation target of 2 percent. That has been moving for the past couple of years truly in the right direction. But at the same time, when global rates are low, and with completely free capital flows, and with exports and imports being roughly 50 percent of GDP, in that environment, when they down here have a [deposit] rate of minus 0.4, then we have to make sure that we pretty much end up doing more or less the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because suppose we were not doing what we would be doing. Then two things would happen. One is that the exchange rate would probably appreciate dramatically. And if the exchange rate were to appreciate dramatically, then import prices would start falling and we would never get inflation up to our inflation target of 2 percent. So, in that sense, there are no easy tradeoffs in this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the way to deal with this issue domestically would be basically to do what it – to make it more expensive to borrow for housing purposes. And that can be done by doing away with the interest rate deductibility; by raising the property tax; by making it more difficult to borrow; by, for example, changing the amortization requirements; let's say introducing some kind of a debt-to-income ratio and a number of things like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's just simply hard – I mean, many different things need to be done at the same time. And usually, in any economy, that's among the hardest things to do, because that means that you would need to do them – these things at the same time. Ideally, in the best of worlds, there should be a bit of coordination when you do them. And that's just difficult to do when you have many decision-making bodies and, ultimately, when there has been an unwillingness on the political side to deal with the housing market issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: So you do not agree that your current mandate – or the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span>'s current mandate – leads to a pro-cyclical policy, because from the outside it looks like it. The Swedish economy's growing strongly, the housing market is booming, but the rate where we operate is stuck at minus 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: It's at minus 0.5. And that has really served us well, because inflation expectations started falling let's say three years ago, something like that. And we were heading in a direction where we could have run the risk of not getting inflation up to our target of 2 percent at all. And that would have been very difficult for us to deal with. And, again, given that in a small, open economy basically nominal rates and real rates are set somewhere else, and then you just have to live with that and deal with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: That's right. But – sorry – just imagine now that the housing market blows up, there's some sort of crisis – the worst case comes, happens. In that case, I assume confidence will plummet, foreign investors will withdraw some of their funding, and the krona will depreciate quite sharply. That means, at the same time, that inflation is probably going to go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Yeah ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: And then this would lead to this pro-cyclicality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Yeah, but that's your – I mean, that's your scenario. But we, on the central bank side, we have explained many, many times over the years what happens or what is likely to happen if things go wrong. And that's not a happy outcome and it's not a pleasant scenario at all, because given your example, if that were to happen, then the exchange rate would depreciate, the inflation would go up, and then that would mean that nominal rates would go up as well. And in that environment, if you had a very large number of households that have borrowed too much – and most of those mortgages are actually variable-rate mortgages – that's not a happy outcome at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And we have – we have explained this many, many times. And this is our argument why others need to do what they have to do to deal with the housing market issue because, otherwise, eventually, there is no – there is no escape, and you end up with a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: I'm just wondering if the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> would have done a better job in bringing up inflation if it had a dual mandate, like the <span class="companylink">U.S. Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: That's hard – that's difficult – very difficult to tell. I mean, given our legal framework when it comes to the mandate that we have, it is already a kind of a dual mandate, in the sense that the way we describe it ourselves is that we are – we are a flexible inflation-targeting bank. And that means that, of course, we keep an eye on what's going on when it comes to unemployment, when it comes to growth and things like that. One way of thinking about it is a sort of an ordering of things, where the inflation target comes first. And to the extent that we can meet our inflation target, then we can sort of take also many other things in consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at this juncture – over the last, let's say, five years, this has not really been an issue, because if – when inflation is too low, then the policy rate is just going to go down. And if the policy rate goes down, that also is helpful when it comes to unemployment. And that's also helpful when it comes to growth in general. What is very, very unusual this time around – if you look at it in a historic context – is the fact that we have ended up with a negative policy rate. And that's the first time since 1668 – I mean, we've been around for a long, long time. So presently we're at a very, very unusual juncture, where growth has been good. And on average, it has actually been much better than in many, many other countries in Europe. And we're, of course, happy for that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, unemployment is roughly where one would expect unemployment to be given a whole host of structural issues in the labor market that we cannot change. So that has also actually been quite good, because unemployment has been falling for a number of years. So in that sense, the developments have been quite favorable. And at the same time, inflation kind of hovers between 1.5 to 2 percent. And we expect it to be that way also over the coming years. But at the same time, all of this is against the background of negative global real rates, or negative or very, very low or zero global real rates. And that, we cannot change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: And you're not the only one having this problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Exactly. No, no, it's not that – it's not that dissimilar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: But is there something – it's very hard. You seem to be suck between a rock and a hard place here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, yeah. I mean, that's what policy-making is like. You have to do what you have to do. And you do as best as you can. And I would say that the country has done reasonably well compared to many other places. And we're very happy for that. While, at the same time, we have this problem with our housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: You already mentioned that Sweden is a small, open economy, and that the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> needs to account of monetary policy abroad, especially to avoid big swings in the exchange rate. And in that respect, are you hoping that the ECB [<span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>] next week will remove its easing bias?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: No, I don't argue about what the ECB should be doing or not doing. I'm fully convinced that people in this building do their utmost to meet their targets. So that is not an issue. The issue is a bit different because, you know, small, open economy with free capital flows, it's just like sailing a small boat on the ocean, because when the big guys move it's going to affect you, and that you know. And then you sort of have to deal with that as best as you can. And they do what they feel that they have to do, being it here or the U.S. dollar. And then you just have to live with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: But surely it would make your job a bit easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: I mean, it's the interest of everybody to get inflation up. So that's not – that's not an issue, because many – or almost most central banks nowadays have an inflation target in one form or another. And inflation goes up in the rest of Europe, given the openness of the Swedish economy, that's, of course, also helpful for us when it comes to pushing up inflation in Sweden. So in that sense, when it comes to what the ECB's doing and what we are doing, we are trying to basically achieve the same thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Yeah, I just wonder – because you have got the exchange rate to watch. And this is a difficult one, because at the time it appreciated, obviously, inflation was kind of – there was downward pressure on it already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, yeah, but on the – when it comes to the exchange rate, I mean, we've had a floating exchange rate since 1992. And we are happy – we are happy with that. And it sort of moves up and down. It's incredibly hard, actually, to make exchange-rate projections because the exchange – that's just difficult to do. But having said that, what we have said over the past few years, time and time again, is that given that the Swedish economy's doing well, given that we're running a fairly large current account surplus, it would be reasonable to think that over time the exchange rate would appreciate slowly because that is what one would expect when – if you are growing a bit faster than some of your neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the same time, given that we are where we are when it comes to the inflation rate, that's a tough trade-off. So it's OK that the exchange rate appreciates, but only if it appreciates slowly over time because otherwise, of course, it would be an issue when it comes to the inflation rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Yeah. You mentioned growth. We had GDP data for the first quarter out this morning. It was weaker than expected. I think it was weaker than what you expected. Does this change your thinking at all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: I mean, I spent all day here doing other things, so it's hard for me to comment on that – on that number. I would say that generally speaking over the coming years we would expect growth to be somewhere between 2 to 2½ [percent], something like that. And just from one quarter to another, that's not a major issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: OK. On a different topic, the amendment to Basel III. This has been dragging on for some time. And will we finally see a deal in June at the next committee meeting?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, I mean, that's up to the committee members, so it's hard for me to tell. You never really know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Take a good guess? (Laughter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: No, I don't want to guess. I don't want to guess. But I'm certainly trying as hard as I can to push this process. And let me – let me put it like this: There are not many moving parts left to deal with. So in that sense, it has been a process where we have been able over a number of years to reduce the number of things that people are talking about. And that has been a good – a good evolutionary process in itself. But there are a few remaining issues that we'll have to try to settle in terms of the numbers, and get people to agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: In brief, what are the main stumbling blocks? One is clearly the output floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Yeah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: That's the biggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: That's the biggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: And the other ones are? Once you're over this one, the other ones will be easy – plain sailing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: (Laughs.) Well, I'm just – no, no, no. The <span class="companylink">Basel Committee</span> has been around since 1974. So in that sense, this kind of work goes on, in some sense forever. But, yes, when it comes to using the phrase finalizing Basel III, that's the remaining – the remaining issue. But having said that, that doesn't mean that this work will sort of completely stop and there's nothing left to do going forward. But at the same time, I think it's important to stress that if we can finish this project that ended up going – being called Basel III, then in the pipeline there is not a project with that type of massive regulatory reform that we have been dealing with by now seven or eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So my hope is that if we can finish Basel III, then from then on it will be more sort of consolidation of the rules that have been produced. Because if you produce a fairly large number of regulatory changes over five, six, seven years, eight years, or something like that, then you probably have to see how the whole thing works. You have to think about to what extent you have to make some tweaks to the system here and there. But it would not be meaningful to kind of start over again on whatever Roman number you choose when it comes to the work of the <span class="companylink">Basel Committee</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: (Laughs.) Last but not least, talking about your tenure at the <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span>, you've been the head of <span class="companylink">Riksbank</span> for 10 years now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: No, well, 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Eleven years. And the mandate expires at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: Are you up for a third term?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Well, that's – I have no comments on that topic at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. ADAM: OK. Well, thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. INGVES: Most welcome.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign the U.S. housing market is returning to normal, Las Vegas and Phoenix -- poster children of the bubble and bust -- are looking average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, which covers home-price fluctuations in the entire nation, rose 5.8% in the 12-month period ended in March, the fastest rate in 33 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increases were in line with price growth in the country's biggest boom-bust markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Las Vegas rose 6.4%, while those in Phoenix climbed 5.6%, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative steadiness comes after a 15-year stretch when the two markets were leaders of the U.S. housing bubble, bust and recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the boom and the bust they were clearly the incredibly hot spots," said David Blitzer, managing director at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "They're no longer so outstanding and unusual."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas home prices hit their peak growth rate in the summer of 2004, rising 53% annually, while Phoenix prices reached 49% annual growth about a year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their falls were almost as dramatic. Las Vegas home prices posted a 33% annual decline in December 2008 while Phoenix prices plummeted 36% a few months later, on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bet on Las Vegas and Phoenix during the latest housing boom, expecting aging baby boomers to flock to the Sunbelt states. Relatively affordable home prices also made it easy for people with middle-class salaries to snap up second or third homes. But the availability of land meant there were few constraints on new construction, leading to a bigger crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the strong rally of the past five years, neither city is close to its previous peak. Las Vegas prices remain one-third below their 2006 high while Phoenix prices remain 27% below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distance from the previous peak isn't necessarily the best measure of health, since both markets likely were overvalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It should be no surprise that it would take them a long time to get back there, if ever," Mr. Blitzer said. "There are things that don't come back, or don't come back in less than a generation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the new booming markets look comparatively restrained, and areas where price gains are concentrated are generally ones with strong job growth and limited supply, not speculative investment and overbuilding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, Seattle led the way in March with a 12.3% home-price increase. Portland reported a 9.2% year-over-year gain and Dallas, which recently replaced Denver in the top three, posted an 8.6% annual increase.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home-price growth continued to accelerate in March, posing a challenge to the market, which already has seen the pace of sales slow because of rising prices and a shortage of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller Indices, covering the whole nation, rose 5.8% in the 12 months ended in March, up from a revised 5.7% year-over-year increase reported in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-city index gained 5.2% over the year, and the 20-city index gained 5.9%, both unchanged from February. That slightly beat the expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the 20-city index to rise 5.8% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains are being driven by growing demand amid rising wages and a large demographic of people entering their 30s and looking to buy homes, as well as limited supply. Economists said they are concerned that price growth that continues to outpace income growth isn't sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of markets have been seeing double-digit or near-double-digit growth. Seattle led the way in March with a 12.3% home-price increase, and Portland reported a 9.2% year-over-year gain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales declined in April, a tepid start to a spring selling season marked by a dearth of homes available for purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned U.S. homes last month fell 2.3% from March's revised level to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring selling season promises to be the most competitive in years [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/buying-a-home-will-be-harder-than-ever-this-spring-1491048002], with a flood of new buyers entering the market at a time when inventory is near 20-year lows. April's data suggest the home shortage could mean weaker sales activity than otherwise would be the case, based on the strength of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand is easily outstripping supply in most of the country and it's stymieing many prospective buyers from finding a home to purchase," said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes on the market has fallen year-over-year for 23 consecutive months, according to NAR. There was a 4.2-month supply of homes on the market at the end of the month, down from 4.6 months a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties typically stayed on the market for 29 days in April, down from 34 days in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in inventory comes at a time of strengthening demand [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-next-hot-housing-market-starter-homes-1494495003]. The share of first-time buyers climbed to 34%, up from 32% in March, as young people began to re-enter the market in force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the trend so far this year has been of a strengthening market. Home sales in the first quarter hit their fastest pace in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are now about 95% of their prerecession average, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, though that figure doesn't account for population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been able to recover as much as they have despite falling inventory levels in part because buyers are pouncing on newly listed homes, which suggests it could be difficult for sales to continue to grow without an infusion of fresh inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers purchased more than 25% of homes on the market in April, a 13-year high, according to Mr. McLaughlin's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in April was $244,800, up 6% from a year earlier. Sales in April were up 1.6% compared with a year earlier,.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory has remained low in part because of a sluggish rate of new-home construction. Housing starts declined in April for the third time in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales also declined in April, suggesting broad-based weakness in the market if the trend continues. Purchases of new, single-family homes, which account for a narrow slice of all U.S. home sales, decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000 in April [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-fell-more-than-expected-in-april-1495548303], down 11.4% from March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In reality, these conditions—tight inventory, high demand and rising prices—look to be with us for a while to come, and buyers should get used to this new normal," said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales fell sharply in April, a potential sign of weakening in the market at a time of rising prices and limited inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of new, single-family homes, which account for a narrow slice of U.S. home sales, decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000 in April, down 11.4% from March, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data have a margin of error of 10.5%, and the overall trend remains one of continuing improvement in the market. Before last month, sales had risen for three straight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has been tepid throughout much of the housing market's five-year recovery, but there have been recent signs of a resurgence in the starter-home segment. Builders say they are stepping up construction at the lower end, and the share of first-time buyers in the market is increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is at or near 10-year highs for sales of newly built and previously owned homes, and economists said momentum is likely to continue throughout the year despite last month's dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend in sales for both [new and existing homes] is clearly up, and up for good reasons. The job numbers are solid, wages appear to be picking up a bit of steam and mortgage rates haven't moved up much," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home fell in April from a year earlier to $309,200, indicating builders are shifting attention toward starter-home buyers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction declined modestly in April for the third time in four months.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Why Millennials Are (Partly) to Blame for the Housing Shortage; As young people and builders have shifted their focus toward trendier urban markets, overall housing construction has declined</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>740 words</div><div>22 May 2017</div><div>05:30</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rush of young people to U.S. cities over the past few years is partly to blame for America's worsening housing shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the country's largest and most prosperous markets, such as New York, San Francisco, Boston and Los Angeles, housing construction has been stronger than normal in the urban core but weaker in the suburbs, where new housing can be built abundantly and more cheaply, according to an analysis set to be released Monday by BuildZoom, a website for construction contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a problem because suburbs are typically the main drivers of housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades during the late-20th century, suburbs were the place to build, as urban cores suffered from high crime, poor schools and stagnant or shrinking populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But preferences have changed among young people, many of whom want to live closer to transit, restaurants and their workplaces. The share of young, educated people living in the urban core of Washington, D.C., for example, increased 8.6 percentage points between 2000 and 2014, according to Jed Kolko, chief economist at job-search site Indeed and senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>. Portland, Ore., and Chicago each saw increases of 6.4 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The expensive cities tend to be shifting toward a paradigm that says having a better location is better than having a fresher, greener, newer place," said Issi Romem, chief economist at BuildZoom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As builders have shifted focus toward trendier urban markets and away from cheaper suburbs, they have produced less housing overall than they otherwise might have. While starter-home construction has bounced back in recent months, it remains far from reversing this long-term trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, high land costs in central cities have pushed developers to focus on higher-end housing geared toward high earners instead of younger people just starting out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift helps explain one of the most vexing aspects of the housing recovery: New homes are getting more expensive and yet there are fewer of them being built than in past cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new home sales within 5 miles of the centers of 10 of the country's priciest and most densely populated metropolitan areas have surpassed levels from 2000, they remain more than 50% below where they were in 2000 when you go more than 10 miles out. The year 2000 is often used as a benchmark for a normal market, before the boom and bust of the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the study looks only at for-sale housing. More of what tends to be produced in city centers is for rent. What's more, demand for starter homes has been bouncing back in recent months, as millennials get married, have children, and get fed up with rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BuildZoom analysis shows that in metro areas where land is less expensive and there are fewer land-use restrictions, exurban starter homes are making a comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Austin, Texas, for example, 35.6% of new residential sales in 2015 was located more than 20 miles from the center, up from 12% in 2000. Indeed, exurban areas saw a threefold increase in new home sales between 2000 and 2015 with areas five to 20 miles from the urban core experiencing a drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The takeaway, Mr. Romem says, is that pricey cities need to loosen land-use restrictions in core areas where there is more demand. Allowing for more high-rise condo buildings would make it economical to produce starter homes in these areas as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do you care about preserving things the way they are, so that only wealthy people can continue buying in, or do you want to [encourage more density], so that housing is more affordable for everyone?" he asked.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates </div><div>1376 words</div><div>19 May 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Juan Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Washington State long cherished for its remoteness and simplicity, is now the hottest luxury real-estate market in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The priciest 10% of the area's real-estate market rose faster last year than any other U.S. county, according to Realtor.com. The median home value in San Juan County is now $444,300, up from $377,600 in 2014, according to real-estate marketplace Zillow. Right now there are four homes priced at $15 million or higher for sale, including one for $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Former Amazon executive Rick Ayre, the owner of the $20 million house, says the price reflects the property's distinctiveness. Near San Juan Island's main town of Friday Harbor, it is 8,000 square feet on 98 acres and features 765 feet of waterfront, a runway, three ponds and an indoor pool. Mr. Ayre bought the slightly curved house in 1999 for around $6.3 million and spent about $3.5 million renovating it. Even with minimal landscaping ("you can't own the land," is his philosophy) the garden alone cost about $1 million because of the fencing and irrigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some locals worry that the low key San Juans could become overpriced, overdeveloped and overcrowded. The growth in demand has been fueled in recent years by an influx of high-tech companies to Seattle, where soaring home prices make the San Juans look like a bargain. A 2000 study commissioned by the county's planning department concluded that, due to similarities in size, scale, access, environment and trends, the San Juans could well end up like Nantucket or Aspen, places where the report said wealthy purchasers of vacation homes have changed the character of the communities and placed substantial pressure on residents. "We're trying to figure out how not to be like that," says Rick Hughes, chair of San Juan County Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others counter that because the Pacific Northwest lacks the density of the Northeast it won't turn into another Nantucket. They say the islands' economy has just started recovering and growth has been gradual. They characterize the mega-pricey listings as anomalies: The priciest sale in the San Juans since 2001 was a property on Orcas that sold for $11.1 million in 2002, according to Merri Ann Simonson, managing broker at Coldwell Banker San Juan Islands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for the four listings say they're priced to sell. "We haven't seen sales go into the top realm yet, but this might be the year that changes," says Moya Skillman, an agent with Team Foster at Avenue Properties who is the sales agent for a $19.98 million home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Johnsen Cameron, vice president of Brand Development Realogics Sotheby's International Realty in Kirkland, is the listing agent for rock musician Steve Miller's house, listed at $14.8 million; she says the replacement cost of his house is "significantly higher" than the price. Mr. Miller said he picked the island of San Juan because he travels a lot and it has the easiest access. His house has been on and off the market since 2014 for $20 million and $17.5 million before settling at its current asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, 73, bought the multiple parcels in 1996 for $4.35 million after many years of sailing by the island on his way to Alaska. The property that's for sale has an 11,686-square-foot, stone-and-wood home on a total of about 40 acres. It also has a dock with deep-water moorage. "For a guy like me, who does 70 cities a year, I needed somewhere I could get in and out of," he explains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Juan County is made up of some 175 islets between Washington state and Vancouver Island, Canada, and is known for its abundance of orca whales and eagles, hiking and kayaking, and breathtaking scenery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Life on these islands -- with a population of 16,339, according to the latest census -- can seem like a throwback. Cellphone service is sketchy. There are no chain stores or traffic lights. Jet skis aren't allowed. Almost every restaurant serves locally grown food. There are still farms that plow with horses and run their farm stands on the honor system. The ferry can get stormed out and the sole hospital has no birthing facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of development is a reflection of the area's remoteness. Only four of the islands are accessible by ferry: San Juan, the largest and most touristy, with the sole airport; Orcas, known for attracting artists and Californians; Lopez, which is flat and rural; and Shaw, which has no restaurants or hotels (and where Bill Gates owns property).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardie and Charles Cobbs bought a 1910 farmhouse earlier this year on Lopez Island as a getaway from their main home on Mercer Island. "Lopez is not trendy, it's not precious. It's authentic," says Ms. Cobbs, an artist. She is redoing her house herself in part because she wasn't able to find any available workers at the time she took ownership of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until two years ago the ferries didn't take reservations, which meant people had to get to the dock hours ahead to ensure a place in line. When that changed, "it turned what was a nerve-racking experience into something easy," says Mark Jenks, 56, an aerospace executive who lives in Kirkland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, in September Mr. Jenks and his wife Ducksoon Hwang, who had been going to Orcas Island for vacation for many years, bought a four-bedroom, 2,950-square-foot house on 1.9 acres on the water with a private cove for $1.1 million on Orcas. They picked the San Juans because they wanted somewhere "organic and authentic," says Ms. Hwang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Carter, 74, an attorney and corporate executive, was living in Malibu when he vacationed on San Juan Island; he found it so beautiful he bought two parcels totaling 21 acres in 1999 for $550,000. In 2002 he built a 1,000-square-foot guesthouse where he lived while he embarked on a 10 year, around $19 million project to build a 15,000-square-foot house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a perfectionist," he explains. Though he built it as a spec house, Mr. Carter has been living there for the past four years. His house first listed in 2015 for $25 million, and last year was reduced to $19.98 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took three years and about $12 million for Kathleen Dickinson and her late husband Ron McDowell to build their house, which was finished in 2007. On 41 acres on Orcas, it is filled with reclaimed wood and intricate architectural details. It first went on to the market in April 2016 for $11.6 million, and was reduced last year to $10 million, a price she says is under the cost of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is usually the case with islands, building a home in the San Juans is expensive. Susan Stoltz and David Kau of Stoltz Kau Architects on Orcas say the cost of construction can be as high as 30% more than on the mainland and finding available full-time workers can be tough. One problem is the growing lack of affordable rentals for seasonal workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an effort under way to preserve land from development. The county's Land Bank Tax, created in 1990, taxes 1% of real-estate sales for buying up land to preserve the natural heritage, while nonprofits like the <span class="companylink">San Juan Preservation Trust</span> raise funds to acquire and preserve land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its still possible to build a house for under a million dollars: Peg O'Hara and her husband built a house for $600,000 in 2014 on Orcas on 9 1/2 acres they bought for $400,000 in 2006. "We just kept it really simple," she says of the 1,400-square-foot house.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ziff Estate Price Cut to $165 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two years on the market, the longtime Florida home of the late publishing magnate William B. Ziff Jr., has cut $30 million off its asking price, reducing the price tag to $165 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Manalapan, just south of Palm Beach, the roughly 15-acre estate named Gemini first went on the market with another firm in 2015 for $195 million. Even at 15% off, it remains one of the priciest residential properties on the market nationwide, according to Todd Peter of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who has the listing with colleague Cristina Condon. The record for the highest-priced home sale in the U.S. was set in 2014, when a home in East Hampton, N.Y traded hands for $147 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ziff family hopes the price cut will "attract more buyers," Mr. Peter said. Given the property's acreage and the amount of water frontage, "they feel like it's an excellent value at this price."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Straddling a barrier island, Gemini has roughly 1,200 feet of frontage on the Atlantic Ocean and about 1,300 feet on the Intracoastal Waterway. The property was purchased decades ago by Mr. Ziff, scion of the <span class="companylink">Ziff-Davis</span> publishing empire, who rebuilt the main house around 2002. It served as his primary residence for many years, his family said in a statement. But his sons Daniel, Dirk and Robert haven't used the home regularly since their father's death in 2006, the statement said, and none of them plan to live there, so they "reluctantly agreed that it makes sense to sell it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property has a total of 33 bedrooms and seven kitchens spread across several buildings, Mr. Peter said. The main house measures about 62,200 square feet. A tunnel under the road that bisects the property is air-conditioned and furnished as a living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Onetime Eric Clapton Home in Los Angeles Relists For More</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The onetime home of rock star Eric Clapton in Los Angeles is returning to market for $5.495 million -- a price increase of nearly $750,000 from the last time it was on the market, five months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Meadows has been trying to sell the contemporary home off Venice Beach for several years. He first put it on the market in 2011 for $2.5 million, saying he would donate any proceeds over the asking price to relief efforts in Japan. The house didn't sell. Mr. Meadows relisted the home in July of last year for $5.195 million, then reduced its price to $4.75 million before taking it off the market in December. "The property values have gone ballistic here," he said of his recent price hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meadows said the house was built in the 1980s and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, who also designed the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles on Grand Avenue. Mr. Clapton, who is English, bought the house in 1999 and owned it until 2004, when he sold it to Mr. Meadows for $1.415 million, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Situated one block from the mellow end of Venice Beach, it made a perfect bachelor pad and I loved it," Mr. Clapton wrote in "Clapton: the Autobiography." But after getting serious with future wife Melia McEnery and "giving in to homesickness," he wrote, the couple "went back to England for good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measuring about 3,000 square feet, the three-bedroom house has a great room with a roughly 30-foot ceiling, according to Josh Altman of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who now has the listing with colleagues Matt Altman and Juliette Hohnen. Mr. Meadows said he built a mezzanine overlooking the great room and added a fireman's pole to provide access to the first level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meadows, a 66-year-old retired architect and actor who was previously married to TV host Leeza Gibbons, said he is also an inventor and is selling because he needs more space to house his creations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$30 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multilevel Manhattan penthouse with a rooftop hot tub is going on the market for $29.995 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers are Jon Venetos, who last year was replaced as the longtime head of Surveyor Capital, a unit of hedge-fund giant Citadel, and his wife, Ashley. Mr. Venetos founded Dallas-based Lurin Capital last year, according to the company's website. The couple is selling because they are relocating to Texas, said listing agent Mark Jovanovic of Compass, adding that Ms. Venetos recently left her job at <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management</span> due to the relocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Soho, the penthouse has about 7,500 square feet of interior space spread over three levels. There are four bedrooms and two offices, one of which is in the master suite, according to Mr. Jovanovic, who has the listing with Scott Hustis. The top level, with an onyx-backed bar, opens to a limestone terrace with an outdoor kitchen and wood-burning fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple combined two units to create the spread. They purchased the first unit in 2010 for $4.5 million, according to property records, then in 2012 bought the floor above for $4.75 million. They then added the rooftop terrace, according to Mr. Jovanovic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing in Kauai at $70 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kauai compound asking $70 million is the most expensive home listing currently on the market in the state of Hawaii, according to listing agent Neal Norman of Hawaii Life Real Estate Brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located on the North Shore near the small town of Kilauea, the roughly 15-acre property known as Hale 'Ae Kai sits on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, with a private path leading down to Secret Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Balinese-inspired main house is composed of four pavilions connected by covered walkways. One contains the living areas, including a media room and gym; a roughly 1,100-square-foot pavilion contains the master bedroom, which has indoor and outdoor showers. Two other pavilions contain bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property also includes a swimming pool, a caretaker's house and a farm that grows palm, coconut and citrus trees, Mr. Norman said. More houses could be built on the property, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is owned by a trust created by financier William H. Strong and his wife, Sandi, according to public records. Mr. Strong was previously co-CEO of Morgan Stanley's Asia Pacific region, and in 2014 he became chairman of Chicago-based Longford Capital, an investment company that specializes in litigation finance, according to Longford's website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Norman said the owners built the house, completing it in 2006, and in recent years have rented it out, charging about $10,000 per night. He said they are selling because they aren't using it as much as they anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2014, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s Mark Zuckerberg paid more than $100 million for roughly 700 acres on Kauai, according to people with knowledge of the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Longtime Manhattan Home of Jacob Javits Goes on the Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longtime home of the late Jacob Javits, the influential politician who served as a U.S. senator from New York for more than 20 years, will list for $5.195 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The East 57th Street apartment is being sold by the children of Sen. Javits and his late wife, Marian, who died earlier this year. The couple bought the prewar co-op in the early 1970s, said their daughter Joy Javits. They had previously lived in a larger apartment on Park Avenue, she said, but moved to this unit after their three children left for college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A duplex spanning the 12th and 13th floors of the building, the apartment has three bedrooms and measures about 3,300 square feet, according to listing agent Pamela D'Arc of <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large living room has roughly 17-foot ceilings and double-height windows, said Ms. D'Arc. Joy Javits said she remembers her father working for hours at a desk in the living room. There is also a glass-walled sitting room off the living room which Sen. Javits used to talk business and smoke cigars, his daughter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joy Javits said she had her wedding with about 150 guests in the apartment, and added that her parents frequently threw parties there. Guests at the apartment included Henry Kissinger and Truman Capote, she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Juan Islands, an archipelago off the coast of Washington State long cherished for its remoteness and simplicity, is now the hottest luxury real-estate market in the country[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/san-juan-islands-the-hottest-luxury-home-market-in-the-country-1495115980]. Some locals worry that the low key San Juans could become overpriced, overdeveloped and overcrowded. The growth in demand has been fueled in recent years by an influx of high-tech companies to Seattle, where soaring home prices make the San Juans look like a bargain.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The onetime home of rock star Eric Clapton in Los Angeles, Calif., is returning to market for $5.495 million—a price increase of nearly $750,000 from the last time it was on the market five months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller Stephen Meadows has been trying to sell the contemporary home off Venice Beach for several years. He first put it on the market in 2011 for $2.5 million, saying he would donate any proceeds over the asking price to relief efforts in Japan. The house didn't sell. Mr. Meadows relisted the home in July of last year for $5.195 million, then reduced its price to $4.75 million before taking it off the market in December. "The property values have gone ballistic here," he said of his recent price hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meadows said the house was built in the 1980s and designed by Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, who also designed the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles on Grand Avenue. Mr. Clapton, who is English, bought the house in 1999 and owned it until 2004, when he sold it to Mr. Meadows for $1.415 million, according to public records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Situated one block from the mellow end of Venice Beach, it made a perfect bachelor pad and I loved it," Mr. Clapton wrote in "Clapton: the Autobiography." But after getting serious with future wife Melia McEnery and "giving in to homesickness," he wrote, the couple "went back to England for good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measuring about 3,000 square feet, the three-bedroom house has massive triangular skylights and a great room with a roughly 30-foot-high ceiling, according to Josh Altman of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, who now has the listing with colleagues Matt Altman and Juliette Hohnen. Mr. Meadows said after buying the house he built a mezzanine overlooking the great room and added a fireman's pole to provide access down to the first level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meadows, a 66-year-old retired architect and actor, said when he bought the house, he found a digital recording in the home's sound system that he believes to be of Mr. Clapton playing guitar. He said he would include it with the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meadows said he is also an inventor, and he is selling because he needs more space to house his creations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home construction declined modestly in April for the third time in four months, a trend that is likely to worsen supply shortages and push prices higher at a time of swelling demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 2.6% from March levels to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.172 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Single-family starts increased by 0.4%, while multifamily starts fell 9.6%, the fourth consecutive month of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With housing starts declining in April, inventory shortages will continue for a longer period of time. The intensifying housing shortage will push up home prices and rents, easily above wage growth and the broad consumer-price inflation," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's decline has a margin of error of 8.8 percentage points. Starts were 0.7% higher than in April 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits, which tend to be a reliable indicator of future construction activity, also fell in April, by 2.5% to an annual pace of 1.229 million. Single-family permits declined 4.5%, while multifamily permits increased by 1.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in starts is likely to exacerbate an imbalance of supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jeff Mezger, chief executive of KB Home, said there is a wave of demand, especially from first-time buyers who are moving out of their parents' homes and forming their own families. But building remains a challenge because of labor shortages and increased regulations, which have driven construction costs up more quickly than pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to see a continued slow increase in activity levels. It's not going to be this explosion," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction jobs increased by 4% year-over-year in April, down from a 5.7% increase in March, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Corp. Mr. Fleming said this creates a dilemma for builders. If they increase wages to attract more workers they might not be able to produce starter homes to respond to increasing demand from first-time buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new-home construction in April declined modestly for the third time in four months, a trend that is likely to worsen supply shortages and push prices higher at a time of swelling demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 2.6% in April [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.172 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's 2.6% decline has a margin of error of 8.8 percentage points, and the overall trend continues to be one of generally increasing activity. Starts were 0.7% higher than the same month last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Mezger, chief executive of KB Home, said the company is seeing a wave of demand, especially from first-time buyers who are moving out of their parents' homes, getting married and having kids.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the first quarter hit their fastest pace in a decade, a sign that rising prices and slightly higher mortgage rates haven't deterred buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing-home sales climbed 1.4% in the quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the highest since the first quarter of 2007, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price, meanwhile, jumped 6.9% from the same quarter a year earlier to $232,100, the sharpest gain in nearly two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand remains strong as millennials begin to enter the housing market in force. But that could change as higher prices weigh on affordability, economists said, particularly if interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographers generally define millennials as people born between roughly 1980 and 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many millennials have been living in cramped conditions, whether in their parents' homes or in pricey urban apartments, "and are being released into the market at a time when affordability is becoming more challenging," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When accounting for population growth, the pace of sales today reflects what economists consider a normal market like that of the early 2000s, when the pace of sales was just under five million homes a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of sales topped out at roughly 6.2 million in 2005, at the height of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth, meanwhile, remains subdued compared with the bubble years but is perking up as well. Single-family home prices increased year over year in 85% of the 178 markets covered in the <span class="companylink">NAR</span>'s survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter, 89% of markets reported higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty metropolitan areas experienced double-digit annual price gains, identical to the number in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets that enjoyed the strongest price gains include Tampa, Fla.; Boulder, Colo.; and Cumberland, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparity between the most and least expensive housing markets continued to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A midprice home in San Jose, Calif. -- the most expensive metro area in the country -- now costs $1.07 million, while the typical home in the cheapest market -- Youngstown, Ohio -- costs $79,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in San Jose have risen 10% over the past year, while prices in the Youngstown area have increased 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes have become less affordable over the past year because of rising prices and mortgage rates, though they remain theoretically within reach for many families. A buyer making a 5% down payment on the median-price U.S. home would need an income of roughly $52,000, compared with the national median household income of just over $71,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, a buyer making a 5% down payment on a typical home would have needed an income of roughly $48,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sessions's Seat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks is joining the race to succeed Sen. Jeff Sessions, he said Monday, presaging a contest that is likely to test the loyalties of some of the nation's most conservative voters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brooks, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is launching a primary election challenge to Republican Sen. Luther Strange, whom former Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley appointed to the Senate in February after Mr. Sessions was confirmed as attorney general under President Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Mr. Bentley resigned as part of an agreement to plead guilty to campaign finance misdemeanors related to an alleged extramarital affair with an aide, an investigation Mr. Strange had overseen as Alabama attorney general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bentley had scheduled the special election for the remaining years of Mr. Sessions's term, which runs through January 2021, for November 2018 to coincide with the midterm elections. His successor, Gov. Kay Ivey, changed the date so the contest will take place this year, depriving Mr. Strange of a year of incumbency to solidify his hold on the seat. The primary is set for Aug. 15 and the general election will be Dec. 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brooks, 63 years old, is known as one of the most conservative House Republicans, particularly on immigration issues.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the first quarter hit their fastest pace in a decade, a sign that rising prices and slightly higher mortgage rates haven't deterred home buyers from rushing into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing-home sales climbed 1.4% in the quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million, the highest since the first quarter of 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price, meanwhile, jumped 6.9% from the same quarter a year earlier to $232,100, the sharpest price gain in nearly two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand remains strong as millennials begin to enter the housing market  [http://www.wsj.com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-next-hot-housing-market-starter-homes-1494495003]in force. But that could change as higher prices weigh on affordability, economists said, particularly if interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many millennials have been living in cramped conditions, whether in their parents' homes or in pricey urban apartments, "and are being released into the market at a time when affordability is becoming more challenging," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When accounting for population growth, the pace of sales today reflects what economists consider a normal market like that of the early 2000s, when the pace of sales was just under 5 million homes a year. The pace of sales topped out at roughly 6.2 million in 2005, at the height of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth, meanwhile, remains subdued compared with the bubble years, but is perking up as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices increased year-over-year in 85% of the 178 markets covered in NAR's survey. In the fourth quarter, 89% of markets reported higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty metropolitan areas experienced double-digit annual price gains, identical to the number in the fourth quarter. The markets that enjoyed the strongest price gains include Tampa, Fla., Boulder, Colo., and Cumberland, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disparity between the most and least expensive housing markets continued to grow. A midprice home in San Jose, Calif.—the most expensive metro area in the country—now costs $1.07 million, while the typical home in the cheapest market—Youngstown, Ohio—costs just $79,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in San Jose have shot up 10% over the past year, while prices in the Youngstown area increased 4% during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes have become less affordable over the past year due to rising prices and mortgage rates, though they remain theoretically within reach for most families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer making a 5% down payment on the median-priced U.S. home would need an income of roughly $52,000, compared with the national median household income of just over $71,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, a buyer making a 5% down payment on a typical home would have needed an income of roughly $48,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability is likely to become more challenging if prices keep rising at this pace and mortgage rates also climb. The rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has risen to 4.05% from about 3.5% in November. Economists expect rates to inch closer to 4.5% by the end of the year, which could make affordability even more challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There will be some choke point where people can no longer afford to buy," Mr. Yun said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple has become the first-ever U.S. company to achieve a market value of $800 billion[https://blogs-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/moneybeat/2017/05/09/apples-800-billion-market-cap/]. In stock markets across the Pacific, it is an 800-pound gorilla in the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taiwan offers the most striking example. Its main stock index broke through 10000[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/taiwan-stocks-close-above-10000-for-first-time-since-new-millennium-1494493105] this week for the first time since the dot-com boom, mainly thanks to the so-called iPhone "supercycle,"[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/the-next-winners-in-the-smartphone-battle-1484569972] which is expected to bring big orders for the island's component makers. The Taiex index has risen 23% over the past year, with half of those gains coming from just three companies, all of which are suppliers to Apple: Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the biggest constituent in the benchmark, iPhone assembler <span class="companylink">Hon Hai Precision Industry</span>, also known as Foxconn, and <span class="companylink">Largan Precision</span>, which makes lens modules[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/smartphone-cameras-flash-brightly-for-these-companies-1486987098] for iPhones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for investors in Taiwan, and other tech companies based in Asia, is that Apple's own needs aren't set in stone. U.K. graphic-chip designer Imagination Technologies, learned that lesson the hard way last month. Its shares lost 62% in one day[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apple-supplier-raises-patent-fight-prospects-as-shares-tumble-1491222493] after Apple said it would fade out its use of the company's technology and design its own graphic chips in-house instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Taiwanese suppliers have a similar problem. Foxconn, for example, makes nearly half of its sales from Apple, according to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. The company's low-margin assembling business is vulnerable to squeezes from Apple as it doesn't involve cutting-edge technology. Indeed, Apple has already been diverting some of its iPhone assembly work to two other Taiwanese companies in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple's move to newer, better technology could create losers elsewhere. The company is widely expected to use a screen technology called organic light-emitting diodes[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/apples-next-iphone-will-have-a-curved-screen-1488260583] in at least some versions of its latest iPhone later this year. That is a big problem for suppliers that make liquid-crystal displays[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/iphone-screen-makers-have-blurry-future-1481263423] for existing iPhones. <span class="companylink">Japan Display</span>, for whom Apple again makes up roughly half of sales, is one supplier now investing heavily in OLED plants. But it may not be moving fast enough to supply to Apple in the near future, according to Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at <span class="companylink">BGC Partners</span>, who says the Japanese screen maker could see sales decline by more than 20% this fiscal year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such examples hold lessons for investors. Apple-mania is buoying several companies—and even entire stock markets—but many have become alarmingly vulnerable to the California-based company's whims. Companies with a clear technological edge and diverse customer base should be preferred. Korea's <span class="companylink">Samsung Electronics</span>, for example, currently dominates the smartphone OLED production[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/samsung-gets-a-boost-from-galaxyand-from-apple-1467901026], while Japan's <span class="companylink">Sony</span> and Taiwan's Largan lead the markets for image sensors[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/sony-finds-success-in-all-the-right-places-1493377529] and lenses respectively, meaning they should prove resilient even if Apple has a change of heart. For what Apple giveth, it can soon taketh away.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Next Hot Housing Market: Starter Homes; Millennials are buying homes, steering builders toward lower price points</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Chris Kirkham </div><div>1209 words</div><div>11 May 2017</div><div>20:09</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are rushing to buy homes after a decade on the sidelines, promising to kick a housing market already flush with luxury sales into higher gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracking home sales to a particular age group is hard, but a series of data points form a mosaic of a generation of young people ready to buy: The number of new-owner households was double the number of new-renter households in the first quarter of this year, the share of first-time buyers is creeping back toward the historical average, and mortgages for first-timers are on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're crawling out of their parents' basements, they're forming households and they're looking to buy," said Doug Bauer, chief executive of home builder Tri Pointe Group Inc., which operates in eight states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a shift, new households are overwhelmingly choosing to buy rather than rent. Some 854,000 new-owner households were formed during the first three months of the year, more than double the 365,000 new-renter households formed during the period, according to Census Bureau data. It was the first time in a decade there were more new buyers than renters, according to an analysis by home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are beginning to shift their focus away from luxury homes and toward homes at lower price points to cater to this burgeoning millennial clientele. Demographers generally define millennials as people born between roughly 1980 and 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of this year, 31% of the speculative homes built by major builders were smaller than 2,250 square feet, indicating they were in the starter-home range, according to housing-research firm <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span>. That is up from 27% a year ago and 24% in the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an increasing confidence level in that part of the market," said Gregg Nelson, co-founder of California home builder Trumark Cos. "The recovery is finally starting to take hold in a broader way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift reflects a reversal of a pattern that has driven the five-year housing-market expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Up until now the luxury market has soared, while the more affordable end of the market has struggled. Tough lending standards, slow wage growth, growing student-debt obligations and a newfound fear of homeownership have combined to crimp demand among millennials in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the return of first-time buyers is allaying fears that millennials might eschew homeownership permanently. But it also provides an infusion of new demand while housing supply is tight and home price growth is significantly outstripping wage gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in February increased by 5.8% over the same month a year earlier, according to the most recent S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return of first-time buyers is accelerating. In all they have accounted for 42% of buyers this year, up from 38% in 2015 and 31% at the lowest point during the recent housing cycle in 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which defines first-time buyers as anyone who hasn't owned a home in the past three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While economists and builders said lending standards have started to ease, getting a mortgage remains challenging for young buyers with shorter credit histories and, in many cases, student debt. Mortgage rates are also expected to rise further this year, posing an added challenge. Rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have risen to 4.05%, up from about 3.5% in November, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County, Calif., Trumark's Mr. Nelson said he has been selling entry-level homes at nearly double the rate of his higher-end ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is even gaining confidence to build homes in more far-flung locations. The company is about to begin construction on a 114-home project in the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles and another development in Manteca, Calif., about 80 miles east of San Francisco. Both areas were hard-hit during the housing crash and were among the slowest to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders largely avoided the exurbs after the bubble burst in 2006. But because land there is cheaper, they can build lower-end homes more profitably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most builders really preferred to stick straight down the fairway, right at the corner of Main and Main. They were afraid to go back into the rough where they built a lot of homes in the prior cycle," said Alan Ratner, senior home-building analyst at Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside Las Vegas, Tri Pointe has introduced a new-home design that is specifically targeted to millennial buyers, featuring indoor-outdoor patios and deck spaces, as well as a separate downstairs bedroom-and-bathroom suite that could be rented out to a housemate. Mr. Bauer said the homes, geared toward first-time buyers, have been selling more rapidly than pricier homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joey Liu, a 28-year-old technology worker, purchased his first home in San Jose, Calif., earlier this year. He said it is more expensive than renting but that he is getting to the stage in life where it was time to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of friends of mine bought a home so I started thinking maybe it was time to buy a home and stop paying rent," said Mr. Liu, who settled on a three-bedroom townhouse for $690,000. He plans to rent out a room to help with the expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had three housewarming parties to celebrate his newfound status. "This is my first house, so it definitely feels different," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders say their return to the starter-home market shouldn't invite comparisons to the fevered construction of the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the misconceptions is that, here we go again, this is another 2005, 2006 where all these builders are going to build hundreds of thousands of homes. We're not going crazy," said Brent Anderson, vice president of investor relations at Scottsdale, Ariz.-based <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. Mr. Anderson said that last year the company was building four to five speculative homes per community and is now up to 6.4 on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building executives said one challenge is that many people are buying first homes later in life, meaning they have higher incomes and greater expectations molded by years of living in luxury downtown rentals. Such buyers also appear wary of driving farther out to get more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sheryl Palmer, president and chief executive of Scottsdale-Ariz.-based <span class="companylink">Taylor Morrison Home Corp</span>., said to cater to this demographic the company is building more three-story townhouses or single-family homes on narrow lots. She said about one-third of the company's buyers this year are millennials, up from 22% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers Inc</span>., which typically builds homes for the top end of the market, is venturing into lower price points. In Houston, the company is building homes starting in the mid-$300,000s range, while a typical Toll home in the area costs around $850,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders have had a nice run since the election, driven by healthy profits and rising confidence. That sweet spot is likely over, and the shift will put a damper on the overall housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders have benefited from stable costs and rising prices. Operating margins at 13 public builders tracked by research firm <span class="companylink">Zelman &amp; Associates</span> averaged 10% in the first quarter, well over the 8% median over the prior 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sweet spot is under fire by rising costs, ironically emanating from Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber is the most visible driver of higher material costs. The Trump administration last month proposed a 20% tariff[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/trump-administration-plans-to-impose-20-tariff-on-canadian-soft-lumber-imports-1493075372] on Canadian lumber imports. The revival of the decades-old trade fight has pushed framing-lumber prices to their highest level in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That matters a lot to the bottom line: Analysts at Evercore ISI estimate that lumber account for 9% of builders' costs. And it isn't just lumber that is going up in price. Flooring manufacturer <span class="companylink">Mohawk Industries</span>, for example said in its first-quarter earnings call[http://investors.lpcorp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=73030&amp;p=irol-eventDetails&amp;EventId=5252045] last month that it has been raising prices across a broad array of products to offset rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor costs, too, are on the rise. The construction industry unemployment rate, at 6.3% last month, has fallen back to its levels during the housing boom. On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that the quits rate—the share of people leaving construction jobs voluntarily and a sign that they think they can get new jobs easily—stood at 2.5% in March, the highest since early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, the official figures may understate how tight the market has become for an industry that has traditionally relied heavily on illegal immigrants. <span class="companylink">Pew Research</span> estimates that Illegal immigrants account for about 13%[http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/11/03/size-of-u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-workforce-stable-after-the-great-recession/] of construction workers, and in some construction occupations their share is significantly higher. A quarter of brick and other masonry workers are working in the U.S. illegally, for example, Pew says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curtis Stevens, chief executive of construction material supplier Louisiana-Pacific, said on the company's first-quarter earnings call last week that home builders were complaining about "labor availability and quality, and the negative impact of aggressive enforcement of immigration."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At minimum, higher costs will cut profit margins, which will likely hit home builder shares. Higher mortgage rates may add to the pressure. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will likely raise rates later this year and further drive up mortgage rates when it starts running off its pile of Treasurys and mortgage securities early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more important issue is how this pressure affects the housing market, which was one of the few bright spots in the first quarter. And since housing helps drive spending of everything from cars to couches, the risk is the economy may end up on a shakier foundation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that $1 trillion may not get you what it used to. A growing labor shortage in the commercial real-estate industry is driving up the costs of some projects, the WSJ's Peter Grant reports, and contractors say that could complicate lawmakers' plans for a big, new infrastructure-spending program.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/labor-shortage-squeezes-builders-1494075600] Construction businesses, excluding those building single-family homes, reached their highest employment level in April since November 2008, according to a builders' group, and contractors are starting to see shortages of electricians, carpenters and other subcontractor laborers. That's helping drive construction labor costs up 4% to 5% annually, outpacing inflation, and the industry still needs 500,000 more workers. The Associated Builders and Contractors estimates 600,000 more workers would be needed for the $1 trillion infrastructure plan President Donald Trump has said he will seek—money that likely will have to include significant new training programs to get enough workers in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's export engine appears to be slowing but it may still have enough power to push global trade growth. Outbound trade flows rose 8% in April from a year ago following a 16.4% gain in March, the WSJ's Mark Magnier reports, the latest signal that China's economy is shifting into a lower gear.[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/china-trade-surplus-widens-to-cny262-3-billion-in-april-1494214706] That has sober implications for a big swath of the trading world, from iron ore producers in Australia to ports in Europe and the U.S., although analysts expect exports to continue to expand even if the pace of growth isn't robust. Even at a reduced pace, exports are expected to contribute to growth in the world's second-largest economy this year as demand for technology products expands in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. ports have been reporting strong inbound volumes from Asia, suggesting that the pull from developed markets remains strong even if China's internal economy is moving in fits and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's second-biggest e-commerce company says investors shouldn't get hooked on black ink. <span class="companylink">JD.com</span> reported its first profit in the recent March quarter after revenue surged 41.2% from a year ago, supported by the nation's strong appetite for online shopping. But Chief Financial Officer Huang Xuande insists the company is focused on investing in "our aggressive expansion plan" rather than sitting back on its newfound profitability[http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/Chinese-e-commerce-company-JD.com-logs-first-quarterly-profit], according to a report in the Nikkei Asian Review. The warning highlights the fierce competition underway between <span class="companylink">JD.com</span> and Chinese market leader <span class="companylink">Alibaba Group Holding</span>. Both companies are bolstering their domestic reach in areas such as grocery delivery—<span class="companylink">JD.com</span> recently bought online supermarket <span class="companylink">Yihaodian</span> from <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart Stores Inc</span>.—and in cross-border services in Southeast Asia. That suggests revenue should continue to soar but profits won't necessarily follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail-industry consolidation is reaching into the luxury world. The new agreement by <span class="companylink">Coach Inc</span>. to acquire rival <span class="companylink">Kate Spade &amp; Co</span>. will create a single company with $5.9 billion in annual sales and 1,300 retail stores and outlets around the world,[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/coach-to-buy-kate-spade-in-2-4-billion-deal-1494242892] the WSJ's Suzanne Kapner and Joshua Jamerson report, highlighting the changing landscape for retailing. The companies target different ends of the handbag market, but both have battled a retail environment that has been challenging, especially for designers with significant exposure to department stores. Coach has revamped its distribution strategy, pulling back from department stores and closing a third of its own sites while setting plans to reduce discount sales both through its own online channel and to off-price chains. Coach says it doesn't plan widespread store closing after the new acquisition, but analysts say that's exactly what they're expecting.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Keiko Morris </div><div>323 words</div><div>7 May 2017</div><div>14:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies building out their office interiors spend more in the suburbs of Long Island than businesses outfitting offices in San Francisco and New York City, according to a report for real-estate services firm JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although both coastal cities recorded higher overall costs to fit out offices, the average out-of-pocket expense for companies on Long Island was $196.18 a square foot, more than $17 higher than the amount spent by tenants in New York City, JLL reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising construction costs are partly to blame, but landlords offering bigger incentives to lure tenants in pricier markets such as New York City is the main reason, researchers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island's proximity to New York City translates into construction costs that are slightly less than those in the city, but Long Island tenants received an average of $35 a square foot in tenant improvement allowances, compared with $65 in New York City, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New York rents are a lot higher, so in order to entice tenants to pay those kinds of rents, those landlords tend to offer higher concession packages," said Tristan Ashby, director of New York research for JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A labor shortage in the construction industry has plagued the U.S. and led to higher costs, as demand for those services has increased, said Mason Mularoni, a senior research analyst at JLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many construction workers left the industry during the last recession and haven't returned, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the preferred office design requires higher-end finishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The polished concrete floors and the industrial look that people are going for, some of that is more expensive than the more traditional offices," Mr. Ashby said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Chapin is president of Willmar Electric Service in Nebraska and a former chairman of the Associated Builders and Contractors. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of his company and said he was the current chairman of the Associated Builders and Contractors. (May 6)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing labor shortage in the commercial real-estate industry is driving up the costs of some projects and could complicate lawmakers' plans for a $1 trillion infrastructure-spending program, contractors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ever since we came out of the great recession, many folks in our industry have been saying: it's coming, it's coming, it's coming," said George Nash Jr., director of preconstruction for Branch and Associates, a Roanoke, Va., contractor. "Today the problem is there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction businesses, excluding those building single-family homes, employed close to 4.2 million workers in April, up 3,000 from March, according to an analysis by the Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group. That was the highest employment level since November 2008, though still below the record 4.4 million workers employed in the nonresidential construction segment in February 2008, the analysis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor pressures are increasing in the construction industry as hiring overall accelerates across the U.S. economy. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 211,000 in April [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-economy-adds-a-robust-211-000-jobs-in-april-1493987658]and the unemployment rate fell to 4.4%, the lowest level in almost a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the hot pockets of construction activity are office development in New York and condominium and rental-housing projects in downtown Los Angeles, Boston and Miami. Big infrastructure projects include the modernization of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and a tunnel in Seattle that will replace a viaduct vulnerable to earthquakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contractors throughout the country said that as the workload grows, they are beginning to see shortages of electricians, carpenters and other subcontractor laborers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they bid out jobs two years ago, several contractors said, two or three subcontractors would typically respond for each part of the project. Today they are running into situations in which there is only one bid, making it harder to hold down costs, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subcontractors said they also are feeling the pinch. <span class="companylink">Gaylor Electric Inc</span>. of Indianapolis has opted against bidding on some jobs "because we didn't have the people," said Chuck Goodrich, the company's president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaylor has added 70 employees in the last two months but still has about 200 empty positions, Mr. Goodrich said. "The economy is growing, and construction jobs need to be filled," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction labor costs are rising an average of 4% to 5% annually, outpacing inflation, according to Anirban Basu, chief economist of the Associated Builders and Contractors. "The situation is going to get worse," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the association said the industry needs 500,000 more workers. The trade group estimates 600,000 additional workers would be needed for the $1 trillion in infrastructure building and improvement for which President Donald Trump has said he would seek funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration has been preparing a major "workforce development initiative" as part of its infrastructure program, a White House spokesman said. "We are committed to both rebuilding America and retraining American workers," the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives said the scarcity stems partly from many workers idled by the downturn finding other jobs and retiring. Also, fewer young people are choosing construction as a profession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some subcontractors are teaming up and creating joint ventures to cope with the labor scarcity. <span class="companylink">Marcum LLP</span>, an accounting firm, has structured 40 such ventures this year, more than twice the number for all of 2016, according to Joe Natarelli, who heads the New York firm's construction practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Typically a contractor wants to keep the whole contract for themselves," Mr. Natarelli said. "We'll [now] see them joint-venture pieces of that contract because they don't have enough labor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction companies also are stepping up their recruitment efforts. Willmar Electric Service, a fourth-generation subcontractor in Lincoln, Neb., recently hired a full-time staff member to search for workers at high schools, trade schools, military bases and other places, according to David Chapin, the firm's president. The company has about 150 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a lot of people who came out of the [information technology] industry. They just found out they didn't like working inside and wanted to work with their hands day-to-day," said Mr. Chapin, who is a former chairman of the Associated Builders and Contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chapin said the firm has 18 months' worth of work in its pipeline, the biggest backlog it has experienced in its 97-year history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been unable to fill all our openings," he said. "We would like to hire more."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ryan Dezember and Corrie Driebusch </div><div>634 words</div><div>4 May 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement stocks are rising alongside booming U.S. house prices and construction, making the shares a rare success story in the depressed world of retailing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the biggest gainers are big-box retailers <span class="companylink">Lowe's Cos</span>. and <span class="companylink">Home Depot Inc</span>., which are up 20% and 16% this year, respectively. Paint maker <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams Co</span>. is up 24%, and tile and hardwood retailer <span class="companylink">Floor &amp; Decor Holdings Inc</span>. last week rose 53% from its initial public offering price on its first day of trading, the largest IPO gain in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.7% this year and the SPDR S&amp;P Retail exchange-traded fund, which doesn't include the home-improvement chains, has lost 2.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the rally: rising home prices and booming construction, as the housing market recovery from the 2008 crisis advances. Rising home prices can give homeowners equity they tap to splurge on cabinets, floors and appliances. Accelerating construction and transactions can tempt sellers to spend on sprucing up properties, while a shortage of new homes often prompts shoppers to renovate instead of moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're finally at the stage of the housing recovery where homeowners are taking on larger projects," said Brad Hunter, chief economist with IAC's HomeAdvisor unit, which matches homeowners with contractors and handymen. "Home improvement is the shining star within retail."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some on Wall Street believe the stocks will rise further. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> on Tuesday raised its price target for <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> shares roughly 13% and those of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> about 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both companies still have valuations below the S&amp;P 500, based on their price compared with their past 12 months of earnings, according to FactSet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further gains are no sure thing. The shares could fall if home buying and building fizzle, if, for instance, interest rates rise faster than expected. Home-improvement firms also run the risk of opening too many stores, something that has plagued retailers in other segments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other U.S. retailers are closing stores at a record pace as shoppers spend more of their money online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement retailers have proved resilient to the migration to online shopping. For big-ticket items and major renovations, like a revamped kitchen or new tile floors, customers often prefer to see goods in person and may need help installing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are things that don't lend themselves to the internet," said Stifel analyst John Baugh, who estimates that home-improvement retail sales rose 7% through March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news for these firms is that the national housing-market recovery continues to advance. In many markets home prices have surpassed their 2006 peaks. Even those that haven't, such as Cleveland and Chicago, have climbed more than 20% since their 2012 lows, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller home price indexes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eurozone's Economy Continued to Grow in the First Quarter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chipping Away at the Output Gap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak jobs figures for the eurozone released Tuesday are a reminder of how far the currency area has to go before closing the gap between what it is producing and what it can produce. And that, in turn, has significant implications for the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers showed employers added just 5,000 workers [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/eurozone-jobless-decline-slows-1493715612] during March, the smallest monthly increase since April 2016. And that wasn't a sudden reversal of a trend. In the final three months of last year, the eurozone created 321,000 jobs. In the first quarter of this year, it added 167,000, or about half as many</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bear in mind this slowdown occurred at a time when business surveys pointed to a strengthening of the eurozone's recovery. It may therefore be a long time before the eurozone's idle workers are all fully employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is increasingly clear that the ECB is placing very little weight on overall inflation rates, and focusing instead on "underlying inflation," the exact nature of which is left a bit vague, but which appears to be determined by what is known as the output gap. Here is ECB President Mario Draghi speaking at his news conference Thursday:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As unutilized resources are still weighing on domestic wage and price formation, measures of underlying inflation remain low and are expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That explains why the unemployment rate and the wage deals it drives have become key for the ECB, and why the March numbers indicate that we shouldn't expect policy makers to start winding down their stimulus measures soon. In Mr. Draghi's home country, Italy, joblessness rose during the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other indicators of slack that show a slow narrowing of the output gap. Responding to a quarterly survey by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>, manufacturers reported they were operating at 82.6% of their capacity in April, up from 82.5% in January. That is obviously a step in the right direction for policy makers who would like to see a rise in inflationary pressures, but it is hardly a headlong rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things are looking up for the eurozone economy, but we shouldn't forget that they had been really bad for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key Developments Around the World</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Rate Rise Unlikely Wednesday, but Possible June Move in Focus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next to no one expects Federal Reserve officials to raise short-term interest rates at the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting Wednesday. Investors are pricing in a 95% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee leaves its benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0.75% to 1%, according to CME. The central bank will give an updated picture of recent economic developments, and officials could send signals about where borrowing costs are headed in the months ahead. The Fed will release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday. Here's what to [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/fed-rate-rise-unlikely-wednesday-but-possible-june-move-in-focus-1493745411] watch for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysis: Hot Housing Markets May Call for More Fed Action</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot housing markets in key U.S. metro areas are raising the risk [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/analysis-hot-housing-markets-may-call-for-more-fed-action-1493753352] the U.S. central bank may have to lift interest rates more than most now expect, Deutsche Bank economist Torsten Slok says in a new report. These housing markets are marching steadily higher even as the Fed has raised short-term interest rates and said more boosts in borrowing costs are likely this year. "It doesn't look like Fed hikes are having any impact on slowing down the housing market," Mr. Slok wrote. "Given the unbroken uptrend observed in home prices, does it make sense for the Fed to be slow and gradual? Shouldn't the Fed be raising rates faster before housing becomes too unaffordable, and to lower the risks of another hard landing in the housing market?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democrats Protest Bill Undoing Dodd-Frank Regulations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span> is expected on Wednesday to vote on legislation that would undo Obama-era financial regulations [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/democrats-protest-bill-undoing-dodd-frank-regulations-1493764253], after Democrats stalled the bill's progress in protest. The Financial Choice Act, introduced by committee chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), would overhaul the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill put in place by Democrats after the financial crisis. The panel met Tuesday to debate Mr. Hensarling's bill, but Democrats opposed to the legislation resisted its advancement by requiring extensive reading from the bill's nearly 600 pages and promising to introduce dozens of amendments attempting to change it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB's Nouy Warns Brexit Might Trigger ‘Race to the Bottom' Among Regulators</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's top banking supervisor warned Tuesday  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecbs-nouy-warns-brexit-might-trigger-race-to-the-bottomamong-regulators-1493744008]that Brexit might trigger a "race to the bottom" among the region's financial regulators. Britain's departure from the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> could cut access to the bloc's single market for about 40 U.K. banking groups, depending on the terms of the exit deal. To retain access to EU customers, banks will likely need to secure a banking license from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>. The ECB has made clear it will only grant licenses to well-capitalized and well-managed banks. Daniele Nouy, head of the ECB's supervisory board, reiterated that message in Vienna on Tuesday, warning that the ECB wouldn't compromise its "usual high standards." But banks might seek another path into the EU, she warned, using branches in a non-EU country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble warned Tuesday that low interest-rate levels in many areas of the globe pose a risk and central banks should embrace a gradual exit strategy [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/germanys-schauble-sees-risk-in-low-interest-rates-1493732801]. "Ultraloose monetary policy in many regions is unhelpful" because it fosters complacency in countries instead of highlighting the need to embrace economic reforms, Mr. Schäuble said at a conference of business leaders from the <span class="companylink">Group of 20</span> industrialized countries.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Michael S. Derby </div><div>612 words</div><div>2 May 2017</div><div>15:29</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hot housing markets in key U.S. metro areas are raising the risk the U.S. central bank may have to lift interest rates more than most now expect, Deutsche Bank economist Torsten Slok says in a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These housing markets are marching steadily higher even as the Fed has raised short-term interest rates and said more boosts in borrowing costs are likely this year. The Fed isn't expected to lift rates in a policy meeting that concludes Wednesday, but two more increases are expected as the year moves forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's policy rate increases are supposed to raise the overall cost of borrowing. Right now, Fed increases aren't intended to slow the economy so much as bring short-term borrowing costs back toward more normal levels. That said, years of rock-bottom rates have fueled fears the central bank has waited too long to act, even though inflation has remained short of the 2% annual rate central bankers want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It doesn't look like Fed hikes are having any impact on slowing down the housing market," Mr. Slok wrote. "Given the unbroken uptrend observed in home prices, does it make sense for the Fed to be slow and gradual? Shouldn't the Fed be raising rates faster before housing becomes too unaffordable, and to lower the risks of another hard landing in the housing market?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Slok stopped short of calling for additional rate rises, but the issue he highlights should loom larger for the Fed if housing gains continue. Already, the closely watched S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller home price indexes have retraced much of the ground lost since 2007, when the last recession began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains, especially when weighed against the outlook for monetary policy, point to some uncomfortable similarities for Fed officials. After all, it was an overly robust housing market, fueled by low rates and unrestrained by steady and gradual rate rises, that played a starring role in the financial crisis of a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, some central bankers see a greater urgency to boost rates because of housing-related issues, as well as other factors. Last month, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said four rate rises for this year [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rosengren-says-fed-should-raise-rates-four-times-in-2017-1490801400] was probably a good idea, relative to the Fed's consensus view that three will get the job done. He has been particularly concerned about commercial real estate and related bank exposure, warning trouble there could fan out throughout the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the matter of the guidance Fed officials are giving now having echoes of a policy stance pursued in the early 2000s, when the housing-market bubble was being inflated. Then, Fed rate rises were done slowly and steadily, amid official pledges to move at a measured pace. While the Fed has yet to move as automatically as it did in those days, patient and gradual rate rises of today aren't entirely dissimilar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late March, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned his colleagues about their pledges to move rates up modestly and regularly [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/feds-bullard-says-series-of-rate-rises-isnt-a-good-idea-1490973467]. He is among the most reluctant to raise rates at the Fed and said that, given how his colleagues have been talking about the rate rise outlook, there is "a significant risk that we get locked into a data-insensitive routine of rate increases that might be counterproductive" to what the Fed wants to achieve.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>752 words</div><div>27 April 2017</div><div>16:54</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in a decade, more new U.S. households in the first quarter chose to buy homes than to rent, suggesting a long-term decline in homeownership rates might be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 854,000 new-owner households were formed during the first three months of the year, more than double the 365,000 new-renter households formed during the period, the Census Bureau said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the first time since the third quarter of 2006 that the number of new homeowners outstripped that of new renters, according to Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the overall homeownership rate ticked down to 63.6% in the first quarter from 63.7% in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists were encouraged by the increase in new households that have joined the ownership ranks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household formation is a key driver of the housing market, both for home purchases and rental units. The fact that more of the new households formed in the first quarter chose to own rather than rent could signal the beginning of a reversal of a long-term decline in overall homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that many new owner-occupied households are forming is really our first sign that the homeownership rate is on the rise," Mr. McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate peaked at just over 69% in the mid-2000s before falling to a 50-year low of 62.9% in the second quarter of 2016. It has hovered around 63.5% for the last couple of quarters, below the long-term average of around 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any lasting increase could be good for the overall U.S. economy. Buying a home contributes more to the economy than renting. More workers are required to build a single-family home than a rental unit, and homeowners spend more on renovations than renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by the <span class="companylink">Rosen Consulting Group</span> found that the home-building industry would have added more than $300 billion to the economy last year if construction returned to the long-term average. In 2016, total spending on housing clocked in at 15.6% of gross domestic product, compared with a 60-year average of almost 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation of more new-owner households also indicates Americans are more confident in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are looking at housing as being a bit more attractive as memories of the financial crisis fade," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist with <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of other recent signs suggest demand for homeownership is gaining strength. Sales of previously built homes reached their strongest sales pace in a decade in March, up 4.4% from the previous month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week. U.S. new home sales were up 5.8% in March, the third consecutive month of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders say they have also been seeing increased interest from first-time buyers and are looking to build starter homes to accommodate them. First-time buyers made up 32% of the market in March, up from 30% a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Thomas, a 28-year-old who works in the medical-device industry in Cleveland, said a recent promotion helped spur him to get off the fence and buy. Mr. Thomas, who moved back to his native city from Chicago a year-and-a-half ago, said he looked at 30 houses and saw many of them go for $5,000 to $10,000 over the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home he recently purchased is 2,000-square feet with a finished basement for $170,000, which translates to the same monthly payment as his former garden apartment in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was sick of throwing money away into rent," Mr. Thomas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some researchers predict the homeownership rate will resume its decline because of a growing minority population (minorities are less likely to own homes), growing student-debt burdens and rising rents that make it difficult to save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Wachter, a professor at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania</span>, is among those who predict the homeownership rate could fall closer to 50% by 2050.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The order of magnitude to get us back to historic norms just is not in this data," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are reasons for the ECB to be cautious. One is political uncertainty, which wasn't eliminated by Emmanuel Macron's victory in the first round of France's presidential election. The second round of that vote looms, as do major elections in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern: core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, has barely budged above 1% for years. That bodes ill for headline inflation, which the ECB aims to keep just below 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the ECB's lack of action, it has been anything but a quiet year for investors, who have been watching eagerly for signs of a policy change.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's red-hot recovery from the depths of the crash five years ago is fueling concerns among economists and real-estate brokers that home prices are overheating [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/rising-home-prices-raise-concerns-of-overheating-1493128355]. A dearth of new construction and strong demand from buyers are pushing up prices twice as fast as the rate of income growth, the latest data show, a level economists said is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why First-Quarter Growth Is Often Weak</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is off to a slow start. Again. First-quarter gross domestic product is expected to expand at a 1% seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate. The figure would be a disappointment alongside strong job creation and soaring consumer optimism following the election of Donald Trump. A weak reading, however, wouldn't be a surprise [https://blogs-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/economics/2017/04/25/why-first-quarter-growth-is-often-weak/].

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB Lending Survey May Fuel Argument for Negative Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Survey data from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> showed Tuesday that negative deposit rates are encouraging eurozone banks to make loans [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-lending-survey-may-fuel-argument-for-negative-rates-1493116964]. The survey could reinforce the central bank's commitment to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels until past the end of its bond-purchase program, as it has said it would do. The ECB's Bank Lending Survey, which polls lenders across the currency zone, showed that demand for financing from firms is expected to grow in the current quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions about the accuracy of China's official economic data are a frequent source of angst, but Hunter Clark, Maxim Pinkovskiy, and Xavier Sala-i-Martin don't find evidence to suggest Beijing's growth figures are exaggerated. In a post for the New York Fed's Liberty Street Economics blog, their research draws upon satellite measurements  [http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/04/is-chinese-growth-overstated.html]of the intensity of China's nighttime light emissions—a good proxy for gross domestic product growth that they say isn't likely subject to whatever measurement errors may affect the country's official economic statistics. The post argues that China's growth wasn't as weak as claimed by some analysts in 2015 and the country isn't experiencing a sharp slowdown right now, although it questions whether the current pace of growth will be sustainable far into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inconvenient Truths About the U.S. Trade Deficit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to blame the large trade deficit on foreign governments, Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein writes in a post for Project Syndicate. "But foreign import barriers and exports subsidies are not the reason for the U.S. trade deficit. The real reason is that Americans are spending more than they produce [https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-trade-deficit-inconvenient-truth-by-martin-feldstein-2017-04]." The policies of foreign governments affect only how that deficit is divided among America's trading partners, he writes. Changes in the U.S. saving rate hold the key to its trade balance, as well as to its long-term level of real incomes. "Blaming others won't alter that fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zombies of Voodoo Economics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1980 George H.W. Bush famously described supply-side economics — the claim that cutting taxes on rich people will conjure up an economic miracle, so much so that revenues will actually rise — as ‘voodoo economic policy,' Paul Krugman writes in the New York Times. "Yet it soon became the official doctrine of the Republican Party [https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2017/04/24/opinion/zombies-of-voodoo-economics.html?_r=0], and still is," he notes. It isn't clear whether President Donald Trump really believes in right-wing economic orthodoxy, according to Mr. Krugman. "He may just be looking for something, anything, he can call a win — and it's a lot easier to come up with a tax reform plan if you don't try to make things add up, if you just assume that extra growth and the revenue it brings will materialize out of thin air."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Upswing in The World Economy is Not Sustained Growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The world economy is improving. The question is how strong and long-lasting this improvement will be," Martin Wolf writes in the Financial Times. He identifies three main downside risks: political backlash against an open world economy, the new U.S. policy agenda and overambitious hopes for economic growth, and irresponsible financial deregulation. The longer-term evolution of the Chinese economy also poses risks, as does Europe, he says. "The biggest question then is whether politics will give the necessary support  [https://www.ft.com/content/9a2afd3e-2686-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025]to economics. There is now a reasonable chance of a cyclical recovery. But turning that into something more durable will mean a delicate balancing act."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's red-hot recovery from the depths of the crash five years ago is fueling concerns among economists and real-estate brokers that home prices are overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of new construction [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/what-will-the-housing-market-do-next-1491211806] and strong demand from buyers [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/cheaper-mortgages-could-spur-housing-market-1492945201] are pushing up prices twice as fast as the rate of income growth, the latest data show, a level economists said is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index released Tuesday showed that in February home prices rose 5.8% from the same month a year earlier. That put prices nearly 40% above their level at the bottom of the housing crash in February 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, incomes rose 3% in February from the same month a year earlier, and are up 12% since February 2012, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local markets have experienced extreme swings. Home prices in San Francisco have vaulted 98% from their low point during the bust and now stand nearly 7% above their earlier record in 2006 at the height of the previous housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, home prices have risen by nearly 53% from their low during the recent bust and are now 35.5% above their previous high. In Denver, prices are now 59% above their previous lows and 36.5% above their previous high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, bidding wars are breaking out. Agents said some buyers are kicking in extra cash when properties don't appraise for the asking price, and some are waiving their right to home inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can't be sustained," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former chief economist at mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, referring to the frenzied buying. "It can't go on forever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a bubble fueled by low-interest rates and easy access to credit, home prices soared to highs in 2006 before tumbling 27% over the following six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year stretch since the 2012 bottom marks the third-fastest period of home-price growth in data going back to 1895, according to David Blitzer, managing director of S&amp;P Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main drivers has been the lack of home construction. Labor shortages, zoning regulations, rising prices of lumber and other building materials, and caution among builders have kept a lid on construction activity in recent years. The supply of homes for sale [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/sluggish-housing-recovery-took-300-billion-toll-on-u-s-economy-data-show-1490526643] in March was down 6.6% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, even as the nine-year anniversary of the current economic expansion approaches, the level of home construction relative to the number of U.S. households is at its lowest level since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> began tracking such data in 1957, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span> from earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are few signs of an imminent housing bust that would lead to steep national declines in home prices, economists said. Unlike the last boom, lending standards are stricter, and many buyers have pristine credit scores and are putting down large down payments, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, while prices have risen rapidly over the past several years, that is partly because they were making up ground lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little risk of a supply glut in the near future, economists generally expect prices to continue rising quickly in most markets for a couple more years, if the economy keeps expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said it is more likely that overheated markets are headed for a long period of flat or slightly declining home prices, especially if mortgage rates rise or job growth slows, but not an outright crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market "is not going to burst, it's going to contract" with falling sales volume, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, a real-estate firm. "You might still see what looks to be a robust market because prices are really strong, but that doesn't mean it's a broad market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, home prices are starting to look frothy for the first time in years. Nationally, homes are about 4% overvalued, meaning prices are slightly above the long-term trend line between household incomes and mortgage costs, according to Mark Boud, chief economist at Metrostudy, a housing research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are in more complicated territory. The Denver market is 8% overvalued, while the Bay Area is 8.5% too pricey based on Mr. Boud's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most overheated markets have supply shortages. Nationwide, there is a shortage of about 3 million homes, Mr. Boud said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets Mr. Boud said are likeliest to experience trouble soon are those in which prices are too high but there aren't significant supply shortages. Dallas, for example, is 10% overvalued but just 2.5% undersupplied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[Dallas] is going to hit the skids sooner than most markets," Mr. Boud said. "Right now jobs are still strong but prices are outpacing even the job market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other signs of overexuberance. The number of licensed Realtors has jumped by nearly 25% since 2012, hitting a nine-year high in 2016 and sitting just 9% below the peak in 2006, according to real-estate consultant John Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, homes are selling briskly. The median number of days that homes spent on the market declined to eight in the first three months of the year from 61 in 2012, according to Redfin. Home prices rose 8.5% in Denver over the year ended in February, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicki Thompson, an agent in Denver, said she recently had a listing that was on the market for two weekends at $1.2 million and she received multiple all-cash offers above the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just crazy," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Mata, a Redfin agent in Denver, said his buyers often will commit to kicking in extra cash if the bank's appraisal comes in lower than the purchase price. "We've got to be coming close to a plateau for prices," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Draghi to Keep Investors in Suspense</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mario Draghi is expected to show off a skill on Thursday that he has been honing all year: Saying as little as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his regular news conference, the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> chief will likely repeat a policy statement that has remained largely unchanged since December, and fend off questions about when the ECB might start to exit its massive monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The policy statement includes pledges to boost the bank's stimulus again if the outlook darkens, by cutting interest rates or accelerating its €60 billion a month bond-purchase program. Those pledges look increasingly outdated as evidence mounts of a robust recovery across the 19-nation eurozone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some top ECB officials, they are at odds with economic reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are reasons for the ECB to be cautious. One is political uncertainty, which wasn't eliminated by Emmanuel Macron's victory in the first round of France's presidential election. The second round of that vote looms, as do major elections in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern: core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, has barely budged above 1% for years. That bodes ill for headline inflation, which the ECB aims to keep just below 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the ECB's lack of action, it has been anything but a quiet year for investors, who have been watching eagerly for signs of a policy change.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policy makers are divided between those who think the current dosage of stimulus is too strong, and those who believe it should continue until the economic recovery leads to a sustained rise in inflation. They must navigate between strengthening economic data and ongoing political risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ECB's next policy meeting, on June 8, may be an opportune time for a policy shift, many analysts say. With the French elections over and a new batch of staff economic forecasts at hand, policy makers will be well placed to reassess the outlook, and potentially drop some contentious phrases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, "this week's press conference could be extremely brief, and differences with the wording [from the last policy meeting in March] will be very hard to find.," said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at <span class="companylink">ING-DiBa</span> in Frankfurt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising Home Prices Raise Concerns of Overheating</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Laura Kusisto</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's red-hot recovery from the depths of the crash five years ago is fueling concerns among economists and real-estate brokers that home prices are overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of new construction and strong demand from buyers are pushing up prices twice as fast as the rate of income growth, the latest data show, a level economists said is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index released Tuesday showed that in February home prices rose 5.8% from the same month a year earlier. That put prices nearly 40% above their level at the bottom of the housing crash in February 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, incomes rose 3% in February from the same month a year earlier, and are up 12% since February 2012, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local markets have experienced extreme swings. Home prices in San Francisco have vaulted 98% from their low point during the bust and now stand nearly 7% above their earlier record in 2006 at the height of the previous housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, home prices have risen by nearly 53% from their low during the recent bust and are now 35.5% above their previous high. In Denver, prices are now 59% above their previous lows and 36.5% above their previous high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, bidding wars are breaking out. Agents said some buyers are kicking in extra cash when properties don't appraise for the asking price, and some are waiving their right to home inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can't be sustained," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former chief economist at mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, referring to the frenzied buying. "It can't go on forever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a bubble fueled by low-interest rates and easy access to credit, home prices soared to highs in 2006 before tumbling 27% over the following six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year stretch since the 2012 bottom marks the third-fastest period of home-price growth in data going back to 1895, according to David Blitzer, managing director of S&amp;P Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main drivers has been the lack of home construction. Labor shortages, zoning regulations, rising prices of lumber and other building materials, and caution among builders have kept a lid on construction activity in recent years. The supply of homes for sale in March was down 6.6% from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, even as the nine-year anniversary of the current economic expansion approaches, the level of home construction relative to the number of U.S. households is at its lowest level since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> began tracking such data in 1957, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span> from earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are few signs of an imminent housing bust that would lead to steep national declines in home prices, economists said. Unlike the last boom, lending standards are stricter, and many buyers have pristine credit scores and are putting down large down payments, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, while prices have risen rapidly over the past several years, that is partly because they were making up ground lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little risk of a supply glut in the near future, economists generally expect prices to continue rising quickly in most markets for a couple more years, if the economy keeps expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said it is more likely that overheated markets are headed for a long period of flat or slightly declining home prices, especially if mortgage rates rise or job growth slows, but not an outright crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market "is not going to burst, it's going to contract" with falling sales volume, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, a real-estate firm. "You might still see what looks to be a robust market because prices are really strong, but that doesn't mean it's a broad market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, home prices are starting to look frothy for the first time in years. Nationally, homes are about 4% overvalued, meaning prices are slightly above the long-term trend line between household incomes and mortgage costs, according to Mark Boud, chief economist at Metrostudy, a housing research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are in more complicated territory. The Denver market is 8% overvalued, while the Bay Area is 8.5% too pricey based on Mr. Boud's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most overheated markets have supply shortages. Nationwide, there is a shortage of about 3 million homes, Mr. Boud said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets Mr. Boud said are likeliest to experience trouble soon are those in which prices are too high but there aren't significant supply shortages. Dallas, for example, is 10% overvalued but just 2.5% undersupplied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[Dallas] is going to hit the skids sooner than most markets," Mr. Boud said. "Right now jobs are still strong but prices are outpacing even the job market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other signs of overexuberance. The number of licensed Realtors has jumped by nearly 25% since 2012, hitting a nine-year high in 2016 and sitting just 9% below the peak in 2006, according to real-estate consultant John Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, homes are selling briskly. The median number of days that homes spent on the market declined to eight in the first three months of the year from 61 in 2012, according to Redfin. Home prices rose 8.5% in Denver over the year ended in February, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicki Thompson, an agent in Denver, said she recently had a listing that was on the market for two weekends at $1.2 million and she received multiple all-cash offers above the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just crazy," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Mata, a Redfin agent in Denver, said his buyers often will commit to kicking in extra cash if the bank's appraisal comes in lower than the purchase price. "We've got to be coming close to a plateau for prices," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why First-Quarter Growth Is Often Weak</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Jeffrey Sparshott</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy is off to a slow start. Again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter gross domestic product is expected to expand at a 1% seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate. The figure would be a disappointment alongside strong job creation and soaring consumer optimism following the election of Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A weak reading, however, wouldn't be a surprise. Slow first quarters followed by rebounds have been common in recent years, generating short-term consternation but leaving the overall economic trajectory little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the latest recession ended, first-quarter growth has averaged a 1% pace. The remaining three quarters have averaged 2.5%, leaving the overall rate of growth at a familiar 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means there is a good chance a poor first-quarter reading on GDP will be another head-fake. It also means it's harder for policy makers and economists to decipher potential warning signs in the real-time GDP data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some pretty wonky reasons behind the phenomenon, known as residual seasonality. It predates the recession and has reappeared despite efforts to eliminate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is it? The <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span> adjusts for predictable seasonal variations—construction slows in the winter, retail sales climb before December holidays, utility use rises and falls with the weather—to give a better sense of underlying economic activity. When those adjustments don't fully account for recurring patterns, you get "residual seasonality."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that means we might be misled by the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The size of this residual seasonality is economically meaningful and has the ability to change the interpretation of recent economic activity," said Kurt Lunsford, a research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, in a recent economic commentary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lunsford finds that private-investment and defense-spending estimates are still out of whack, cutting 0.8 percentage point from the first quarter and adding 0.6 point in the second. That means GDP should show a 1.6% pace of growth in the first quarter of 2016, rather than 0.8%, and 0.8% in the second quarter, rather than 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(To be clear, fine-tuning seasonal adjustments isn't a way to make the economy look better. If a new formula adds to first-quarter GDP, it necessarily subtracts from another quarter or quarters, leaving overall growth the same.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BEA, which compiles and does much of the calculation for the GDP report, last year rolled out a three-phase plan to address the issue, which it defined as "lingering seasonality even though the data have already been adjusted to remove seasonal effects."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials appear sold on seasonal factors to explain an apparent weak patch. "Although GDP appeared to be expanding relatively slowly in the current quarter, that development seemed primarily to reflect temporary factors, possibly including residual seasonality," minutes from the March 14-15 meeting said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is buying the seasonal-adjustment argument.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at Nomura credit the BEA with resolving much of the seasonal-adjustment problem, suggesting that numbers due out Friday may reflect economic reality—and a technical rebound in the second quarter may not be a given.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that most of the recent weakness in the spending data reflects the underlying trend of the economy as opposed to technical measurement issues," the investment bank said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Notably, data on motor-vehicle sales, energy output and inventories have all been fairly weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB Lending Survey May Fuel Argument for Negative Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Todd Buell</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT—Survey data from the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> showed Tuesday that negative deposit rates are encouraging eurozone banks to make loans. The survey could reinforce the central bank's commitment to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels until past the end of its bond-purchase program, as it has said it would do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ECB's Bank Lending Survey, which polls lenders across the currency zone, showed that demand for financing from firms is expected to grow in the current quarter. More banks are set to tighten standards on loans to companies in the current quarter than ease them, however most are likely to keep them unchanged, the survey showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey results say that the ECB's negative deposit rate, in place for nearly three years, "while having a negative impact on banks' net interest income, is assessed by banks to have a positive impact on their lending volumes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ECB has said that it would keep rates at current or lower levels until well past the end of its bond-purchase program. The ECB currently buys €60 billion a month in mostly government bonds, and is to continue doing so until the end of the year. It is then expected to reduce the net purchases gradually to zero, meaning that a rate increase wouldn't come until late 2018 or 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The indication that negative rates help bank lending would encourage the ECB to stick to this path, said Ken Wattret of TS Lombard. "If you're looking for reasons to stick with the sequencing, that's another argument for doing it that way," he said. The ECB is due to announce its next policy decision on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that the ECB would generally be pleased with the survey results, especially indications that its asset-purchase program and negative rates were supporting lending. The survey showed that banks were using additional liquidity from asset purchases to extend loans, while bond purchases were positively influencing banks' liquidity position and market financing conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the effect that the ECB has intended and will be encouraging to read for the doves on the governing council," said Bert Colijn, an economist at bank ING.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks also reported that negative rates have hurt profitability. "This should concern the ECB from a stability perspective, but as the program seems to indeed support credit conditions, these results are at best ambivalent for the ECB hawks," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European Bank Executives Push Back at Regulators</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Julia-Ambra Verlaine</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRUSSELS—European bank executives told regulators they were taking too long to complete the postcrisis financial rule book in a shifting political environment, leaving lenders at competitive disadvantage and putting the bloc's economic recovery at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't care what you do, but get it done and don't change it for the next 10 years," Andreas Treichl, chief executive of Austria's largest lender, <span class="companylink">Erste Group Bank AG</span>, said at a <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span> hearing Tuesday. "You're not making it very easy for us to create prosperity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Frédéric Oudéa, chief executive officer of France's <span class="companylink">Société Générale</span>, told lawmakers that Europe needed to stop creating new rules given the global political landscape—notably the U.K.'s upcoming exit from the bloc and a fresh U.S. administration under President Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The CEOs voiced their views at a panel of politicians and regulators on rules put forward by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span>—the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s executive arm—in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed legislation would implement new requirements on bank capital, including so-called total loss-absorbing capacity, across the EU as laid out by global standard-setters such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, European bankers have been reticent to publicly argue about financial oversight with regulators and politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the political landscape on financial rules has recently changed with the growth of populist, nationalist tendencies at home and in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EU banks also are concerned that by implementing the rules before they are agreed upon at the international level—such as the ones proposed by the <span class="companylink">Basel Committee</span>—they will lose a competitive edge, specifically against in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While complaints from bankers about regulatory uncertainty aren't novel, Brexit is another source of unpredictability for the bloc's banks, which will have to relocate staff and are still in the process of transforming business models to adhere to rules built in the aftermath of the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Two countries have a capital market: Switzerland, which is not part of the EU, and the U.K., which is leaving the EU," said Mr. Treichl. "So who do you think will finance the startups?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The capital market isn't there, the private investor isn't there, and banks are increasingly facing difficulty doing it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in the U.S., European businesses and companies rely on traditional bank lending for cash rather than capital markets. Mr. Oudéa said it was important to think "strategically" about rules relating to capital-market activities in light of Brexit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Parliament</span>'s economic and monetary affairs committee regularly holds public hearings between lawmakers, regulators, supervisors, and senior bankers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising Rates Pose a Risk for Students Looking to Refinance Debt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By AnnaMaria Andriotis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage refinancing isn't the only lending business that could face pressure from rising short-term rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest-rate savings on student-loan refinancing are also shrinking as short-term rates have started to move higher, according to a new report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing student loans has taken off in the last five years as fintech lenders, led by <span class="companylink">Social Finance Inc</span>. or SoFi, have been offering to replace borrowers' federal student loans with new loans that have lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recent years, rates on many federal student loans weren't based on market rates, but a higher uniform rate set by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the savings are declining for some of the most creditworthy borrowers. Those with the highest credit scores who refinanced early this year received an interest rate that on average was about 2.2 percentage points lower than the rate on their original loan, according to LendKey Technologies Inc., which tracks student loans at credit unions and community banks. In 2014 and 2015, the average interest rate savings exceeded 3 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on private student loans are usually pegged to the one-month or three-month London interbank offered rate, which have been moving up in recent months with the Federal Reserve's short-term interest-rate target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, interest rates on newly issued federal student loans are down. Unsubsidized Stafford loans, for example, given to undergraduate students for the current academic year have a fixed rate of 3.76%, compared with 4.66% two years before and 6.8% four years prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in federal student-loan pricing is largely the result of a repricing strategy implemented by the federal government starting for the 2013-14 academic year. Since then, federal student-loan rates have been based on a rate from the last 10-year Treasury auction that occurs each May. Between 2006 and until this change, federal student-loan rates had been set in advance by federal law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, refinancing can result in significant savings for many borrowers. That includes those who still have older federal student loans at high rates. Borrowers who signed up for private student loans to attend college that have high rates could also benefit if their credit scores have since improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LendKey says student-loan refinances topped $200 million in 2016 for the institutions on its platform, up 80% from a year prior. It says the savings borrowers receive remain substantial, adding that the decline in savings is likely due to the small number of borrowers in some of its credit-score brackets. Borrowers who refinance their loans with credit unions and other small banks receive an interest rate that on average is 2.2 percentage points lower than the rate they were previously paying, according to the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dip in savings among certain credit scores points to a broader issue for the student-loan refinance industry. Sustaining growth for these lenders has been largely based on how long they can offer rate savings that are large enough to give consumers the incentive to refinance. Those savings, for many borrowers, also need to be big enough to offset the fact that they are giving up federal repayment protections, such as loan forgiveness, when they switch from federal to private loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SoFi's chief executive, Mike Cagney, has been vocal about the limited time-span on this market for several years, warning that lenders who enter the market just to focus on student-loan refinances aren't pursuing a good strategy. SoFi has in recent years expanded to other loans, including mortgages and personal loans, pitching those products to its student-loan borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stock That's as Safe as Switzerland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Brian Blackstone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ZURICH—Want a really, really safe asset? How about a slice of the Swiss central bank?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in one of the world's few publicly traded central banks are up more than 50% in the last year. With a small, fixed dividend and limited supply, they trade more like a bond or a piece of memorabilia than a stock. This makes the <span class="companylink">Swiss National Bank</span>'s stock a quirky though potentially enticing alternative to zero-yielding bank deposits or negative-yielding bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of forces are at work, analysts say. For one, negative rates have increased demand for other safe assets—the existence of SNB shares wasn't even that widely known in Switzerland—while the SNB turned in a 21.3 billion franc (around $21.5 billion) profit in the first half of 2016. Since so few shares trade, it doesn't take much to move the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's money-printing powers make it basically impossible to go bankrupt, and it is able to charge commercial banks to store money there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it isn't a normal bank stock. The SNB's governing board doesn't own any shares. Its biggest single shareholder isn't even Swiss; he is German.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some shareholders are now clamoring for the first dividend increase in more than a century at the SNB's annual shareholders meeting on April 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under current law, the maximum dividend is 15 francs a share for a total payout of 1.5 million francs. That is a tiny slice of the SNB's 24.5 billion franc profit last year generated by its money-printing efforts that added hundreds of billions of francs to its portfolio of foreign assets in recent years. The SNB paid 1.7 billion francs to federal and state governments, known as cantons, last year. The vast majority of the profit went to the SNB's reserve accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when it loses money, as it did in 2015, the central bank can always print more. The Swiss franc is among the strongest currencies in the world, meaning the SNB has a monopoly on a coveted commodity. It charges commercial banks to deposit money. In short: A nice mix for any bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes some sense to hold SNB shares," said Alexander Koch, an economist at <span class="companylink">Raiffeisen Schweiz</span> and SNB shareholder. "You don't look at them like usual equities with rights for shareholders. It's more like a debt security obligation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank's status as a publicly traded stock will be on display Friday when top SNB officials meet shareholders. Around 30 small shareholders, under the umbrella group Collectif AAA+, say the SNB's dividend should be calculated at 6% of the year-end share price, not the 250-franc price that has been fixed for decades. SNB shares fetched 1,750 francs on Dec. 31, implying a dividend of 105 francs a share by that calculation. They traded at 1,718 francs around midday Wednesday, little changed on the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SNB board opposes the measure and is certain to beat it back given tight limits on voting rights for private shareholders, which own 48% of SNB shares, but only 25% of voting shares. The rest are held by Swiss cantons. The SNB's mandate is to keep inflation under 2%, not maximize shareholder value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SNB declined to comment on why it opposes the shareholder initiative. Even if it passes, parliament would have to change the law since rules on the dividend are set by federal law. This underscores one downside to owning SNB shares: stockholders' lack of influence over the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One leader of the dividend movement, SNB shareholder Blaise Rossellat of Geneva, says he knows he won't win, but wants to "shed some light" on the SNB's practices, which have amounted to creating hundreds of billions of francs to buy foreign stocks and bonds and weaken the Swiss franc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SNB's foreign reserves totaled 683 billion francs in March, and include billion-dollar stakes in <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Exxon Mobil Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It only invests overseas. It doesn't invest in Switzerland," said Mr. Rossellat, adding the SNB's policies have inflated asset prices abroad. "By this proposition we show the Swiss citizens that their purchasing power has been diminished."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other central banks have some private ownership. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Italy</span>'s capital is owned mostly by the country's commercial banks. Central banks in Belgium, Greece and Japan are listed on exchanges. These shares were mostly flat in the last year, though Greece's were up some.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's board of governors is an independent federal agency. Commercial banks hold stakes in Fed district banks, but they aren't listed shares. The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> is owned by the central banks of the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>. The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> was privately owned before being nationalized in 1946.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SNB's stock traded between 1,090 francs and 2,120 francs over the past year and rallied as Swiss interest rates turned negative even out to 2050 maturities, making the minuscule dividend seem generous by comparison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors treat the share of the SNB like a bond substitute," said UBS economist Alessandro Bee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a novelty aspect too, given the small pool of shares available and the Swiss public's deep attachment to their currency. There are 100,000 SNB shares, with about 2,200 private shareholders owning 48,000 of them at the end of last year. The largest single shareholder last year was German investor Theo Siegert, according to SNB data, whose 6,720 shares topped even those of the Swiss canton of Berne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Siegert didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rossellat owns just one share personally and a handful through other entities. An alternate SNB board member, Dewet Moser, owns one share. Only about 50 to 100 shares change hands each day versus millions that trade daily for big Swiss banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a really special share. It's nostalgic," said Simon Roth, spokesman for Swiss bank Pictet, which holds a small number of SNB shares as custodian for its clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the quirkiness of Switzerland's hybrid setup, owning shares gives the public a direct line to central-bank policy makers once a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's our chance as citizens to democratically have discussions with the organization," said Mr. Rossellat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Traders Getting an Early Glimpse at <span class="companylink">U.K. Government</span> Data? Currency Markets Suggest Yes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Mike Bird</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A comparison of trading data for the Swedish krona and British pound may provide further evidence that some investors could be trading with knowledge of U.K. official statistics before they are published.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden and Britain, two European countries with widely traded currencies, have very different approaches when it comes to policy on who sees official economic data before it goes out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sweden, nobody outside the statistics office, not even the country's prime minister, is allowed to see sensitive data before release, according to <span class="companylink">Statistics Sweden</span>, the country's official data provider. In Britain, over a hundred lawmakers, advisers and press officers get to see some numbers up to a day before it comes out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British pound often moves sharply in the hour before data is released, but the krona shows no signs of moving ahead of Swedish numbers, an analysis of trading data between January 2011 and March 2017 suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the hour before unexpectedly strong or weak U.K. data is made public, the pound moved 0.065% versus the dollar on average in the same direction it subsequently did after those numbers came out, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Alexander Kurov, associate professor of finance at West Virginia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It showed that the average change in the pound's value one hour before and after such economic data announcements is 0.127%, meaning around half the shift associated with the statistics came ahead of their official release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Swedish krona moved by an average of 0.163% versus the dollar over the same period before and after unexpectedly strong and weak data releases, according to the analysis. But in the hour ahead of public dissemination, the krona drifted only 0.003% in the direction it would end up going after publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The evidence of informed trading before U.K. macroeconomic news is very strong," said Prof. Kurov. "The data offers no indication that informed trading is taking place before comparable Swedish announcements."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger-than-expected data will typically boost a currency as investors factor in a healthier economy and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. Weaker-than-expected numbers will mainly have the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.K. statisticians and some lawmakers have long been concerned that widespread access to official data ahead of release increases the risks of it being leaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a senior U.K. lawmaker asked Britain's financial regulator to investigate whether economic data is being leaked and traded upon. That followed a Wall Street Journal article that found <span class="companylink">British government</span> bond futures were also moving as if traders were aware of U.K. economic data before its release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Financial Conduct Authority</span>, U.K.'s financial market regulator, declined to comment on Prof. Kurov's latest findings. Representatives for the Office for National Statistics and the U.K's Cabinet Office, which is responsible for prerelease access policies, also didn't comment on the findings but said that they take compliance with rules on prerelease access extremely seriously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be other reasons why markets move ahead of embargoed data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the comparison with Sweden may undermine one potential explanation for British bonds and the pound appearing to anticipate statistics: that traders have simply become better at estimating economic data before it is released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous research by Prof. Kurov has also shown that traders in the U.S. aren't anticipating government released statistics with the same precision as those in Britain appear to be. In the U.S., only the president and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers receive that data a day in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The krona and pound are the world's ninth and fourth most traded currencies respectively. Comparison with most European peers is hard because their participation in the 19-member eurozone means their national data is likely to have less impact on the euro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Kurov has published several papers investigating market reactions to important economic and financial announcements across currency markets, U.S. bonds and equities, and oil and other commodities, using techniques that other academics have used in similar analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis conducted by Prof. Kurov looked at 254 releases of U.K. consumer-price inflation, industrial production, retail sales and labor-market data over the six-year period. The releases were considered by the market to be surprises, meaning that the figure came in above or below the consensus estimate of analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sweden, Dr. Kurov looked at 297 surprises across the same set of economic indicators as well as gross domestic product data, and across the same period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweden has had a policy of no early access to official data for at least 15 years, said Nizar Chakkour, press officer at <span class="companylink">Statistics Sweden</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chakkour said that this policy helps to make data releases independent from the government and ensures equal access to data for everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in the U.K. say that British lawmakers have traditionally liked to see the data ahead of time so they can prepare ahead of briefing the media and other politicians. For U.K. unemployment data, for instance, 118 people have prerelease access, according to ONS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many statisticians and some lawmakers believe that this wide and early distribution of data increases risks of leaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wall Street Journal's March story on suspicious movements in the bond market prompted a call by Andrew Tyrie, head of the British parliament's Treasury Select Committee, for the FCA to investigate whether economic data is being leaked and traded upon for "inappropriate gain in financial markets."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators say that widespread leaking can undermine confidence in public markets because it gives investors with early information an unfair trading advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also hits the credibility of the system through which the data is released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a review last year into U.K. official statistics, former Bank of England Deputy Governor Charles Bean noted that Sweden, Finland and Denmark, the countries that offer least pre-released data, "also happen to have some of the highest levels of trust in official statistics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> asked residents of 35 European countries how much they trusted their country's economic statistics. Swedes expressed the highest level of confidence, with 73% saying they tended to trust the data. The U.K. came 23rd, with 44% of respondents saying they tended to trust the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia Inflation Returns to Central Bank's Target</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By James Glynn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—Inflation in Australia returned to the central bank's target for the first time in more than two years in the first quarter, but higher interest rates remain a distant reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 0.5% in the first quarter from the previous three months and were up 2.1% from a year earlier, sneaking back into the <span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of Australia</span>'s target of 2%-3% annual inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the result was weaker than forecast. Economists had expected consumer prices to rise 0.6% from the previous quarter and 2.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp increase in gasoline prices and a low base of comparison a year ago helped nudged the headline inflation up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Core inflation, which is more pertinent to decision making around interest rates, rose 0.5% on quarter, and was up 1.8% on year, the government statistician said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian dollar fell by nearly half a U.S. cent after the data, approaching lows around US$0.7510.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the RBA would be more comfortable with inflation returning to the target band, but the outlook remains for still-sluggish price growth, weighed down by record-low wage growth and a soft job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a recent rise in the unemployment rate to 5.9% extends over the coming months, the RBA's concerns about entrenched low inflation readings might deepen, ensuring interest rates remain steady for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates have remained at a record low 1.5% for more than half a year, with the central bank increasingly boxed in by roaring house prices and a soft job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists warn that any changes in interest rates could have unintended consequences for the economy. Household debt has risen to record levels and the RBA has warned about the potential for instability in the banking sector if house prices are crunched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banking regulator announced a fresh round of regulatory clamps in late February, designed to slow lending for property and tighten loan-quality standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics, who had expected the RBA to cut rates twice more in light of soft inflation, now concedes that the window period has closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic outlook now suggests rates could be on hold until 2019, Mr. Dales said. Subdued inflation and the RBA's concerns over the overheated housing market imply that the central bank can sit tight through 2017 and 2018, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Williamson, senior economist at Citigroup, said he doesn't expect a rate increase until late 2018, noting that it would take a long time to reduce the slack in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slow domestic demand growth and competition from online and global retailers will constrain price growth in the nonfood retail sector, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low wage growth and recent increases in some mortgage interest rates at a time of record high household debt "will prohibit many market-based CPI price lines from increasing at anything but a snail's pace," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts Split on <span class="companylink">Turkey's Central Bank</span> Decision Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts were split on <span class="companylink">Turkey's central bank</span> monetary policy committee meeting decision set for Wednesday. Half of the 12 analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the central bank to raise the late liquidity lending rate between 50 and 75 basis points from 11.75%, while the rest expect no change. All analysts expect the central bank to keep overnight borrowing and lending rates and the one-week repo rate steady. The central bank "is unlikely to raise rates unless it has to and it has been helped out in recent days by the firmer lira and the removal of one uncertainty now the referendum is out of the way," said Nigel Rendell of Medley Global Advisors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no near-term signs of a recession, though the U.S. is in a late stage of the economic cycle, T. Rowe Price Group Chief Executive William Stromberg told The Wall Street Journal. The Federal Reserve walks "a fine line between raising and normalizing without tipping things into a slower growth mode," he said. Today, unemployment is low, the Fed is normalizing rates and credit spreads are tight, the CEO said. "If the central bank goes too fast or too far with their program of raising rates, that usually is what tips things over, but it doesn't appear that they're in a really big hurry."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yields on Indian sovereign debt have risen some 30 basis points since this month's central-bank meeting, where a key rate was raised amid prospects of rising inflation, one-third of it since Thursday's release of the minutes. They showed policy makers more worried about inflation than the rate increase appeared to suggest. "The minutes carried hawkish undertones, with one of the senior [<span class="companylink">Reserve Bank of India</span>] members reasoning that a 25-basis-point hike was needed for a durable push towards the 4% inflation target," said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS.</p>

<span class="companylink">People's Bank of China</span> Vice Gov.

Meanwhile, he reportedly said progress has been made as China opens up its onshore bond market to overseas investors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brexit and a weaker pound mean the U.K. economy is set to slow, said Gero Jung, chief economist at Mirabaud Asset Management. "We continue to believe that economic activity is likely to decelerate, mainly because of a slowing in consumption spending and weaker investment." As a result, the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> will "look through inflation spikes" and keep interest rates low. March retail sales were much weaker than expected and will weigh on first-quarter economic growth, he said. Preliminary first-quarter U.K. gross domestic product data are due Friday. Mirabaud expects quarterly growth to drop to 0.3%, slightly below the consensus in a Wall Street Journal poll for growth of 0.4%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB to Stay Put Ahead of French Runoff</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> is unlikely to send strong new signals on monetary policy at its Thursday meeting ahead of the second round of the French presidential election, Berenberg economist Holger Schmieding said. A number of bond market participants expect the focus to turn to quantitative-easing tapering after the French vote, and Berenberg expects the announcement to come in the autumn. For now, the ECB is purchasing €60 billion ($65 billion) of assets a month until at least December. The French runoff is scheduled for May 7.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It Pays to Read the Fine Print on ECB Lending Survey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every quarter, the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> publishes a densely worded release about bank lending and, perhaps just like your mortgage, it pays to read the fine print. For example, this survey reports a so-called net easing of credit standards to firms in the first quarter to be followed by a "slight net tightening" of standards in the second quarter. A look to the fine print shows, however, that they could just have easily said "unchanged." In fact, 96% of respondents said their standards had "remained basically unchanged" in the first quarter. Three percent said they had "eased somewhat," while 1% reported a tightening. Thus a 2% net easing, yes, but largely a picture of stability.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors should buy shorter corporate bonds and sell longer debt to position for the prospective tapering of the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s corporate sector purchase program, AllianceBernstein says. This is the opposite of what the ECB has forced investors to do with the launch of credit quantitative easing: Search for yield in longer maturities. And if investors do abandon the long end due to tapering, the yield curve should get steeper as longer yields rise alongside declining bond prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Chinese Growth Overstated?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Questions about the accuracy of China's official economic data are a frequent source of angst, but Hunter Clark, Maxim Pinkovskiy, and Xavier Sala-i-Martin don't find evidence to suggest Beijing's growth figures are exaggerated. In a post for the New York Fed's Liberty Street Economics blog, their research draws upon satellite measurements  [http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/04/is-chinese-growth-overstated.html]of the intensity of China's nighttime light emissions—a good proxy for gross domestic product growth that they say isn't likely subject to whatever measurement errors may affect the country's official economic statistics. The post argues that China's growth wasn't as weak as claimed by some analysts in 2015 and the country isn't experiencing a sharp slowdown right now, although it questions whether the current pace of growth will be sustainable far into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inconvenient Truths About the U.S. Trade Deficit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is easy to blame the large trade deficit on foreign governments, Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein writes in a post for Project Syndicate. "But foreign import barriers and exports subsidies are not the reason for the U.S. trade deficit. The real reason is that Americans are spending more than they produce [https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-trade-deficit-inconvenient-truth-by-martin-feldstein-2017-04]." The policies of foreign governments affect only how that deficit is divided among America's trading partners, he writes. Changes in the U.S. saving rate hold the key to its trade balance, as well as to its long-term level of real incomes. "Blaming others won't alter that fact."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zombies of Voodoo Economics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 1980 George H.W. Bush famously described supply-side economics — the claim that cutting taxes on rich people will conjure up an economic miracle, so much so that revenues will actually rise — as ‘voodoo economic policy,' Paul Krugman writes in the New York Times. "Yet it soon became the official doctrine of the Republican Party [https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2017/04/24/opinion/zombies-of-voodoo-economics.html?_r=0], and still is," he notes. It isn't clear whether President Donald Trump really believes in right-wing economic orthodoxy, according to Mr. Krugman. "He may just be looking for something, anything, he can call a win — and it's a lot easier to come up with a tax reform plan if you don't try to make things add up, if you just assume that extra growth and the revenue it brings will materialize out of thin air."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Upswing in The World Economy is Not Sustained Growth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The world economy is improving. The question is how strong and long-lasting this improvement will be," Martin Wolf writes in the Financial Times. He identifies three main downside risks: political backlash against an open world economy, the new U.S. policy agenda and overambitious hopes for economic growth, and irresponsible financial deregulation. The longer-term evolution of the Chinese economy also poses risks, as does Europe, he says. "The biggest question then is whether politics will give the necessary support  [https://www.ft.com/content/9a2afd3e-2686-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025]to economics. There is now a reasonable chance of a cyclical recovery. But turning that into something more durable will mean a delicate balancing act."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's red-hot recovery from the depths of the crash five years ago is fueling concerns among economists and real-estate brokers that home prices are overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of new construction[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/what-will-the-housing-market-do-next-1491211806] and strong demand from buyers[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/cheaper-mortgages-could-spur-housing-market-1492945201] are pushing up prices twice as fast as the rate of income growth, the latest data show, a level economists said is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index released Tuesday showed that in February home prices rose 5.8% from the same month a year earlier. That put prices nearly 40% above their level at the bottom of the housing crash in February 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, incomes rose 3% in February from the same month a year earlier, and are up 12% since February 2012, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local markets have experienced extreme swings. Home prices in San Francisco have vaulted 98% from their low point during the bust and now stand nearly 7% above their earlier record in 2006 at the height of the previous housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, home prices have risen by nearly 53% from their low during the recent bust and are now 35.5% above their previous high. In Denver, prices are now 59% above their previous lows and 36.5% above their previous high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, bidding wars are breaking out. Agents said some buyers are kicking in extra cash when properties don't appraise for the asking price, and some are waiving their right to home inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can't be sustained," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former chief economist at mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, referring to the frenzied buying. "It can't go on forever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a bubble fueled by low-interest rates and easy access to credit, home prices soared to highs in 2006 before tumbling 27% over the following six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year stretch since the 2012 bottom marks the third-fastest period of home-price growth in data going back to 1895, according to David Blitzer, managing director of S&amp;P Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main drivers has been the lack of home construction. Labor shortages, zoning regulations, rising prices of lumber and other building materials, and caution among builders have kept a lid on construction activity in recent years. The supply of homes for sale[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/sluggish-housing-recovery-took-300-billion-toll-on-u-s-economy-data-show-1490526643] in March was down 6.6% from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, even as the nine-year anniversary of the current economic expansion approaches, the level of home construction relative to the number of U.S. households is at its lowest level since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> began tracking such data in 1957, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span> from earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are few signs of an imminent housing bust that would lead to steep national declines in home prices, economists said. Unlike the last boom, lending standards are stricter, and many buyers have pristine credit scores and are putting down large down payments, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, while prices have risen rapidly over the past several years, that is partly because they were making up ground lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little risk of a supply glut in the near future, economists generally expect prices to continue rising quickly in most markets for a couple more years, if the economy keeps expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said it is more likely that overheated markets are headed for a long period of flat or slightly declining home prices, especially if mortgage rates rise or job growth slows, but not an outright crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market "is not going to burst, it's going to contract" with falling sales volume, said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, a real-estate firm. "You might still see what looks to be a robust market because prices are really strong, but that doesn't mean it's a broad market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, home prices are starting to look frothy for the first time in years. Nationally, homes are about 4% overvalued, meaning prices are slightly above the long-term trend line between household incomes and mortgage costs, according to Mark Boud, chief economist at Metrostudy, a housing research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are in more complicated territory. The Denver market is 8% overvalued, while the Bay Area is 8.5% too pricey based on Mr. Boud's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most overheated markets have supply shortages. Nationwide, there is a shortage of about 3 million homes, Mr. Boud said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets Mr. Boud said are likeliest to experience trouble soon are those in which prices are too high but there aren't significant supply shortages. Dallas, for example, is 10% overvalued but just 2.5% undersupplied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[Dallas] is going to hit the skids sooner than most markets," Mr. Boud said. "Right now jobs are still strong but prices are outpacing even the job market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other signs of overexuberance. The number of licensed Realtors has jumped by nearly 25% since 2012, hitting a nine-year high in 2016 and sitting just 9% below the peak in 2006, according to real-estate consultant John Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, homes are selling briskly. The median number of days that homes spent on the market declined to eight in the first three months of the year from 61 in 2012, according to Redfin. Home prices rose 8.5% in Denver over the year ended in February, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicki Thompson, an agent in Denver, said she recently had a listing that was on the market for two weekends at $1.2 million and she received multiple all-cash offers above the listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just crazy," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Mata, a Redfin agent in Denver, said his buyers often will commit to kicking in extra cash if the bank's appraisal comes in lower than the purchase price. "We've got to be coming close to a plateau for prices," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's red-hot recovery from the depths of the crash five years ago is fueling concerns among economists and real-estate brokers that home prices are overheating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dearth of new construction and strong demand from buyers are pushing up prices twice as fast as the rate of income growth, the latest data show, a level economists said is unsustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index released Tuesday showed that in February home prices rose 5.8% from the same month a year earlier. That put prices nearly 40% above their level at the bottom of the housing crash in February 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, incomes rose 3% in February from the same month a year earlier, and are up 12% since February 2012, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local markets have experienced extreme swings. Home prices in San Francisco have vaulted 98% from their low point during the bust and now stand nearly 7% above their earlier record in 2006 at the height of the previous housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, home prices have risen by nearly 53% from their low during the recent bust and are now 35.5% above their previous high. In Denver, prices are now 59% above their previous lows and 36.5% above their previous high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, bidding wars are breaking out. Agents said some buyers are kicking in extra cash when properties don't appraise for the asking price, and some are waiving their right to home inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It can't be sustained," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance and a former chief economist at mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, referring to the frenzied buying. "It can't go on forever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a bubble fueled by low-interest rates and easy access to credit, home prices soared to highs in 2006 before tumbling 27% over the following six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year stretch since the 2012 bottom marks the third-fastest period of home-price growth in data going back to 1895, according to David Blitzer, managing director of S&amp;P Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main drivers has been the lack of home construction. Labor shortages, zoning regulations, rising prices of lumber and other building materials, and caution among builders have kept a lid on construction activity in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale in March was down 6.6% from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, even as the nine-year anniversary of the current economic expansion approaches, the level of home construction relative to the number of U.S. households is at its lowest level since the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> began tracking such data in 1957, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span> from earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, there are few signs of an imminent housing bust that would lead to steep national declines in home prices, economists said. Unlike the last boom, lending standards are stricter, and many buyers have pristine credit scores and are putting down large down payments, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, while prices have risen rapidly over the past several years, that is partly because they were making up ground lost during the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little risk of a supply glut in the near future, economists generally expect prices to continue rising quickly in most markets for a couple of more years, if the economy keeps expanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said it is more likely that overheated markets are headed for a long period of flat or slightly declining home prices, especially if mortgage rates rise or job growth slows, but not an outright crash.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of Frothiness</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Housing Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are starting to look frothy for the first time in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, homes are about 4% overvalued, meaning prices are slightly above the long-term trend line between household incomes and mortgage costs, according to Mark Boud, chief economist at Metrostudy, a housing research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are in more complicated territory. The Denver market is 8% overvalued, while the Bay Area is 8.5% too pricey based on Mr. Boud's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most overheated markets have supply shortages. Nationwide, there is a shortage of about three million homes, Mr. Boud said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets Mr. Boud said are likeliest to experience trouble soon are those in which prices are too high but there aren't significant supply shortages. Dallas, for example, is 10% overvalued but just 2.5% undersupplied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"[Dallas] is going to hit the skids sooner than most markets," Mr. Boud said. "Jobs are still strong but prices are outpacing even the job market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other signs of overexuberance. The number of licensed Realtors has jumped by nearly 25% since 2012, hitting a nine-year high in 2016, according to real-estate consultant John Burns.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto  and Jeffrey Sparshott </div><div>555 words</div><div>25 April 2017</div><div>11:32</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes increased sharply for the third consecutive month in March, an indication that demand is picking up as the crucial spring selling season heats up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of newly built single-family houses, which account for about a 10th of overall U.S. home sales, increased 5.8% [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf] last month from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 621,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the strongest level since July, when sales reached a 9-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data were clouded by a margin of error of 15.5 percentage points that is much larger than the reported increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, momentum appears to be building in the market. New home sales have increased every month so far this year, and were up 15.6% year-over-year in March, slightly more than the margin of error in the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a newly built home rose just over 1% from a year ago to $315,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect new home sales to continue to increase this year as builders step up construction of single-family homes and more first-time buyers come back into the starter-home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate consultant John Burns said one reason the market for new homes hasn't been stronger is that many of the big markets for new construction, such as Las Vegas and Phoenix, are only now starting to boom again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You need those big construction markets to take off," Mr. Burns said. "It's starting to pick back up in those markets, just off of a very low level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction has been sluggish since the recession, due to labor shortages, a lack of available credit to small home builders and, more recently, the rising cost of raw materials such as lumber. U.S. housing starts decreased [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fell-6-8-in-march-1492519532] 6.8% in March, although the overall trend in recent months has been one of acceleration in the pace of new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing-home market has been going strong, although a shortage of supply is holding back sales numbers. Purchases of previously owned homes [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-existing-home-sales-rose-in-march-to-highest-pace-since-2007-1492783659], which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, increased 4.4% in March to their highest level in a decade, the National Association of Realtors said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction has improved steadily over the past six years but remains well short of levels before and during the housing bubble. Over the past year, for example, builders have started construction on almost 792,000 single-family homes. From 1995 to 2000, a fairly normal stretch for the market, the average was 1.2 million a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some measures the supply of inventory of new homes is more robust than that of existing ones. It would take just 3.8 months to exhaust the supply of previously owned homes on the market at the current sales pace, versus 5.2 months for new homes, Commerce said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes for sale was the highest since July 2009.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TUESDAY: March new-home sales data from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> could show whether high prices and low inventory are damping buyer demand. Friday's report on March existing-home sales proved just the opposite. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect new-home sales to drop 2% to 580,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEDNESDAY: The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> rate setters will gather in Frankfurt on Wednesday and Thursday for their latest policy meeting. Pressure has been building on the bank to wind down easy-money policies as the eurozone economy picks up. But officials are expected to play it safe, leaving their massive monetary stimulus unchanged ahead of a series of major elections in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Japan</span> also holds a policy meeting Wednesday and Thursday, where officials are expected to leave policy unchanged and slightly temper their optimism about inflation. In a quarterly outlook to be finalized at the meeting, the BOJ likely will lower its price projection for the fiscal year ending March 2018, although it may counterbalance the cut by raising its economic assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THURSDAY: The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases data on U.S. pending home sales for March. The pending home sales index climbed 5.5% in February from the prior month to 112.3, its highest level since April 2016 and the second-highest reading since May 2006. Economists surveyed by WSJ expect March sales to decrease by 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIDAY: The <span class="companylink">U.S. Commerce Department</span> releases its advance estimate of gross domestic product for the first quarter. Economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, and the latest GDP figure is expected to be held back by weak consumer spending. Separate measures show strong consumer confidence and rising wages, suggesting a pickup in activity later in the year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Florida state senator who unleashed a string of racist and sexist insults at fellow lawmakers this week resigned Friday, putting an end to a scandal that had engulfed the Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My recent actions and words that I spoke fell far short of what I expect for myself, and for this I am very sorry," Republican Sen. Frank Artiles wrote in a resignation letter to the Senate president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controversy began Monday night at the members-only Governors Club in Tallahassee, when Mr. Artiles expressed anger about some stalled legislation in conversation with two black fellow senators. Democratic Sen. Perry Thurston said Mr. Artiles called Senate colleagues by words like "bitch," "girl," and "pussy." Mr. Thurston said Mr. Artiles also referred to six Senate leaders as "n-----s."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Buyers Surge Into Market as Spring Home Buying Season Begins; Rising prices, tight inventory did little to deter buyers of previously owned homes in March</span>
</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto </div><div>607 words</div><div>21 April 2017</div><div>11:49</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rebounded in March, as buyers flooded into the market for the spring season and were only partly deterred by a shortage of inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases of previously owned homes, which account for the vast majority of U.S. sales, increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.71 million last month, up 4.4% from February, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That was their highest pace in 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase comes after home sales dropped a revised 3.9% in February because of rising prices and mortgage rates and a shortage of inventory [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/buying-a-home-will-be-harder-than-ever-this-spring-1491048002].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with last March sales were up 5.9%. It also marked the third time in five months that sales have reached a cyclical high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist, said buyer demand has remained surprisingly strong despite rising prices and tight inventory. Sales are "doing much better than I anticipated, particularly in light of affordability challenges," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists said that the pace of sales remains much lower than it should be, especially taking into account population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We would see record sales, sales that we haven't seen since 2005, but since there's no inventory we're going to underperform potential," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory increased 5.8% at the end of March from a month earlier, but it was still down 6.6% from a year earlier. At the current sales pace, it would take 3.8 months to exhaust the supply of existing homes on the market. Economists say the typical supply is roughly six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory has remained low in part because of a sluggish rate of new-home construction and reluctance of sellers to put their homes on the market for fear they won't be able to find anything to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. housing starts declined 6.8% in March [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/u-s-housing-starts-fell-6-8-in-march-1492519532], but the overall trend remains toward increasing new-home construction. New home building was up 8.1% in the first quarter from the same period in 2016, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory is also helping to push up prices much faster than incomes, which in turn is slowing the pace of sales. The median sale price rose 6.8% in February from a year earlier, to $236,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some evidence that new buyers are also finally starting to enter the market, although rising prices remain a deterrent. First-time home buyers made up to 32% of the market, unchanged from February and up from 30% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter, Tian Liu, chief economist at Genworth Mortgage Insurance, said the company saw a 5 percentage-point increase in the share of mortgages issued to first-time buyers to nearly 50%. The company specializes in the type of low down payment loans experts say could help lure young buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are confident that first-time home buyers will continue to drive this market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining mortgage rates could also help drive additional demand in the coming months. The rate for a 30-year mortgage declined to 3.97% this week, from 4.08% a week earlier, mortgage company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said on Thursday.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paul Hannon </div><div>675 words</div><div>20 April 2017</div><div>10:40</div><div>WSJ Pro Central Banking</div><div>RSTPROCB</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2017, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of buildings and infrastructure across the eurozone rose at its fastest pace in almost five years during February, while consumer confidence strengthened ahead of a key election in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both developments are consistent with a number of other signs that the eurozone's modest economic recovery  [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-officials-warn-against-dialing-back-stimulus-too-soon-1492623929]has gathered fresh momentum this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency said on Thursday that output in the construction sector jumped 6.9% from January, the largest month-to-month rise since March 2012. <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said output was 7.1% higher than in February 2016, the largest year-to-year gain since April 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February surge in construction was led by Belgium, home of many of the EU's shared institutions, where output soared by 18.7% from the previous month. The eurozone's largest members also recorded big rises, with German construction up 13.6% and French building up 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building work can be volatile from month to month, but the February surge follows a strong second half to 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in other developed economies, construction suffered severely after the global financial crisis. But its recovery from that trauma was hindered by the eurozone's subsequent government debt and banking crises, which weakened the confidence needed to embark on new projects, and made the credit needed to fund them scarcer and more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, construction activity remains well below its peak before the financial crisis. A sustained revival would be sign that the eurozone's modest recovery is broadening and lifting most parts of the economy, including those that suffered most damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary results of a monthly survey by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> also pointed to a continued pickup in optimism among the eurozone's consumers, despite the possibility of big economic and political changes following upcoming elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commission Thursday said its monthly measure of consumer sentiment rose to minus 3.6 in April from minus 5.0 in March. Aside from when it hit the same level in March 2015, the measure suggests consumers haven't been as upbeat since mid-2007, more than a year before the onset of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey comes ahead of the first round of presidential elections in France on April 23. Recent opinion polls suggests Marine Le Pen, who wants to pull France out of the eurozone and the EU, is likely to make it through to a second-round runoff [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/french-industrial-decline-fuels-le-pens-rise-1492680603] to be held next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the year began, policy makers and economists had feared that an unusually busy, and potentially transformative, series of elections could spook consumers and hit spending. But the resilience of consumer confidence in the face of those potential headwinds should help support what has to date been a modest economic recovery, because more optimistic households tend to spend more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There remains a possibility that consumer confidence in the eurozone could be periodically pressurized by political uncertainty and tensions over the coming months," said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Markit. "This would be particularly the case if there was a shock result in the looming France elections, notably a win for Le Pen. Additionally, there will be an election in Germany in September.

</div><div class="author">By Paul Vieira </div><div>1100 words</div><div>20 April 2017</div><div>10:35</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are surging in Toronto after a clampdown on foreign buyers on the other side of the country, in the latest example of how relentless overseas demand is outrunning policy makers' efforts to tame buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British Columbia authorities slapped a 15% tax on foreign buyers last July to curb a run up in Vancouver, where house prices rose 30% in a year. Almost immediately, sales in Vancouver plummeted—and took off in Toronto, Canada's largest city and 2,700 miles to the east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The migration of the housing bubble—as some prominent economists have called the latest surge in home prices—also points to how tough it is for lawmakers to manage potential bubbles-in-the-making when interest rates sit at near-record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March, a 28.6% rise from a year earlier pushed the average cost of a Toronto home to just under C$1 million ($750,000), up from $558,000 just three years ago and making it one of the fastest rising markets in North America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a bubble of historic proportions," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at asset manager Gluskin Sheff &amp; Associates in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto's year-over-year price surge is so stark, and the city is so important to the Canadian economy, that a correction in home prices now poses a risk to the country's financial system, some economists warn. The Toronto area accounts for roughly 19% of Canada's gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also may escalate existing worries about the strength of Canada's financial system. Data compiled by the <span class="companylink">Bank for International Settlements</span> suggest the amount of credit extended to households and nonfinancial firms and the level of house prices above long-term trends have both hit alarming levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risks and strain on affordability prompted the government of Ontario on Thursday to unveil more than a dozen measures to address rising real-estate costs—highlighted by a 15% surtax on foreign house buyers, largely mimicking what British Columbia authorities did. The government said the suite of policies, including a tax on vacant Toronto residences and caps on rent increases, is meant to bring stability to a frothy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Vacant homes and speculators who never set foot in Ontario exaggerate our challenges. So we are taking action to discourage this practice," Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said at a press conference in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Toronto rise isn't entirely explained by robust economic activity and changes in domestic supply or demand factors, economists say. There isn't direct evidence showing that foreign buying has increased in Toronto, and Canadian data on such transactions are weak. Still, Canada's federal government in March has pledged $241 million over a decade to bolster housing data collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz, who has warned repeatedly about the growing risk of overvalued housing in Canada, last week cautioned that Toronto's gains are unsustainable and "divorced from any fundamentals that we can identify."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Poloz has also said an interest-rate hike wouldn't be the right tool to tame the housing market, highlighting the dilemma faced by central bankers world-wide. Like his counterparts in Sweden, Australia and New Zealand, countries that also have struggled to recover from the credit crisis or have been hit by the more recent downturn in commodities prices, Mr. Poloz is keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels to foster growth, and is maintaining that position despite exposure to a possible housing correction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Canada's central bank</span> has cut rates twice since January 2015 to 0.50%, and isn't expected to begin raising them until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian policy makers have reached for other tools to try to tame the frothiness in housing prices and to limit risky borrowing. Federal officials have stepped in on six separate occasions since 2008 with measures ranging from requiring larger down payments on costlier homes to reducing the maximum period for paying off a mortgage to 25 years from 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these measures aim to reduce the risk that a correction could create systemic financial mayhem, as happened in the U.S. subprime crisis. They made it tougher for first-time home buyers but are failing to target the real sources of frothiness, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That does absolutely nothing to stop a foreigner or a speculator. And that's where the source of strength is now coming from," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vancouver tax, unveiled last July, was introduced after some research showed that overseas buyers, mostly from China, were playing a significant role in pushing up prices. As sales volume dropped in Vancouver, the new tax appeared to nudge foreign buyers toward at least a couple of new markets, including Seattle, where the median house price in March rose 15.6% over a year to $530,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In and around Toronto, an already heated housing market with year-over-year price gains of more than 16% in July 2016, started picking up steam after Vancouver's tax came into effect. Agents started to notice that overbidding was escalating to new levels, said Jessie Banwait, a Toronto-area real-estate agent with Re/Max Real Estate, who has noticed a surge in foreign buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents say that foreign buyers aren't the only ones fueling Toronto's froth. John Pasalis, president of Toronto-based Realosophy Realty Inc., said domestic clients started approaching him last year about purchasing single-family homes as rental properties. Mr. Pasalis recalls, some of these buyers were indifferent to the possibility that monthly rental income might fall short in covering the mortgage and tax bill. "That started to alarm us," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there also are signs that Toronto's overvaluation may spread to the greater Toronto area, which is home to 5.6 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, house prices in Hamilton, a city roughly 42 miles west of Toronto, rose 29.5% in March from the same year-ago period; the Kitchener-Waterloo area, 66 miles west of Toronto, 32.3%; and Barrie, 68 miles north of Toronto, 43.4%. Ontario's foreign-buyer tax proposes to extend beyond Toronto to some of these affected regions, the government said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is no longer a Toronto and Vancouver story," said Stefane Marion, chief economist of National Bank Financial.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Paul Hannon </div><div>675 words</div><div>20 April 2017</div><div>10:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of buildings and infrastructure across the eurozone rose at its fastest pace in almost five years during February, while consumer confidence strengthened ahead of a key election in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both developments are consistent with a number of other signs that the eurozone's modest economic recovery [https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/ecb-officials-warn-against-dialing-back-stimulus-too-soon-1492623929]has gathered fresh momentum this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Union</span>'s statistics agency said on Thursday that output in the construction sector jumped 6.9% from January, the largest month-to-month rise since March 2012. <span class="companylink">Eurostat</span> said output was 7.1% higher than in February 2016, the largest year-to-year gain since April 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February surge in construction was led by Belgium, home of many of the EU's shared institutions, where output soared by 18.7% from the previous month. The eurozone's largest members also recorded big rises, with German construction up 13.6% and French building up 8.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building work can be volatile from month to month, but the February surge follows a strong second half to 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in other developed economies, construction suffered severely after the global financial crisis. But its recovery from that trauma was hindered by the eurozone's subsequent government debt and banking crises, which weakened the confidence needed to embark on new projects, and made the credit needed to fund them scarcer and more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, construction activity remains well below its peak before the financial crisis. A sustained revival would be sign that the eurozone's modest recovery is broadening and lifting most parts of the economy, including those that suffered most damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary results of a monthly survey by the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> also pointed to a continued pickup in optimism among the eurozone's consumers, despite the possibility of big economic and political changes following upcoming elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commission Thursday said its monthly measure of consumer sentiment rose to minus 3.6 in April from minus 5.0 in March. Aside from when it hit the same level in March 2015, the measure suggests consumers haven't been as upbeat since mid-2007, more than a year before the onset of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey comes ahead of the first round of presidential elections in France on April 23. Recent opinion polls suggests Marine Le Pen, who wants to pull France out of the eurozone and the EU, is likely to make it through to a second-round runoff[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/french-industrial-decline-fuels-le-pens-rise-1492680603] to be held next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the year began, policy makers and economists had feared that an unusually busy, and potentially transformative, series of elections could spook consumers and hit spending. But the resilience of consumer confidence in the face of those potential headwinds should help support what has to date been a modest economic recovery, because more optimistic households tend to spend more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There remains a possibility that consumer confidence in the eurozone could be periodically pressurized by political uncertainty and tensions over the coming months," said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Markit. "This would be particularly the case if there was a shock result in the looming France elections, notably a win for Le Pen. Additionally, there will be an election in Germany in September. Meanwhile, the Italian political situation is fragile. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Official figures for economic growth during the first quarter will be released on May 3. But even if they do record a pickup in quarter-to-quarter growth from the modest 0.4% rate recorded in the final three months of last year, policy makers at the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> are likely to remain cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economic recovery in the euro area is gaining momentum" and "there may be some upside risk in the very short-term," ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said Wednesday. But looking farther out, he said the risks are "still tilted to the downside."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. housing starts declined in March, but not enough to signal a reversal from the long-term trend of improvement in new-home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts decreased 6.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.215 million from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline comes after an unusually strong winter, buoyed by temperate weather in most parts of the country. Single-family housing starts in February hit their highest level since October 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a lot of projects that probably would have started in March but they started in January or February, so there's a little bit of payback there," said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal future home construction, rose 3.6% to an annual pace of 1.26 million last month and were up 17%, compared with the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The permit numbers "should quash any concerns that home builders might be pulling back," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on housing starts tend to be volatile and imprecise. Still, the trend for the year so far is one of steady improvement. New-home construction was up 8.1% in the first quarter from the same period in 2016. Permits in the first three months of 2017 jumped 10.4% from a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Collegiate Athletic Association</span> said Tuesday that it is returning to North Carolina for several future athletic events, including men's basketball-tournament games in 2020 and 2021, now that state legislators have dialed back a controversial bathroom law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Carolina was chosen to host an array of matches, from early rounds of the men's basketball tournament in 2020 and 2021 to men's soccer matches in 2019 and women's swimming and diving championships in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NCAA</span>'s board of governors said it would "reluctantly" allow consideration of North Carolina championship bids after the rollback but still hoped for a full repeal. The year-old law, known as House Bill 2, required people to use public restrooms associated with birth sex, rather than gender identity. Last month, lawmakers repealed most of the law's provisions but also blocked local governments from passing nondiscrimination ordinances until December 2020, a move criticized by advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NCAA</span> had yanked men's basketball games from North Carolina this year in protest of House Bill 2, costing the state about $14.5 million, according to the Greensboro Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits, which can signal future home construction and tend to be a less volatile measure, rose 3.6% to an annual pace of 1.260 million last month and were up 17% compared with the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The permit numbers "should quash any concerns that home builders might be pulling back," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at home-tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on housing starts tend to be volatile and imprecise. Last month's 6.8% drop for starts came with a margin of error of 12.5 percentage points. The 3.6% increase in permits had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the trend for the year so far is one of steady improvement. New home construction was up 8.1% in the first quarter from the same period in 2016. Permits in the first three months of 2017 jumped 10.4% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts fell in March for both single-family and multifamily construction. Permits last month were higher for buildings with multiple units but fell for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the drop in starts is consistent with other data showing that builders are becoming slightly more cautious. Builder confidence fell three points in April to a level of 68[https://www.nahb.org/en/news-and-publications/press-releases/2017/04/builder-confidence-holds-firm-in-april.aspx], the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Monday. Any number above 50 indicates that builders view conditions as good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Dietz, chief economist at the NAHB, said builders expressed familiar concerns about the high price of land and labor shortages. New concerns are also cropping up about a possible jump in lumber prices and disappointment with the slow progress of legislative initiatives in Washington perceived as friendly to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a bit of a fallback as it becomes clear it's going to take a little longer to get things done," Mr. Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other good news for home buyers heading into an especially robust spring selling season[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/buying-a-home-will-be-harder-than-ever-this-spring-1491048002] is that completions of new homes were up 3.2% compared with last month and 13% above last year. That could help ease supply shortages that have created bidding wars across the U.S.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen </div><div>399 words</div><div>14 April 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything's big in Texas -- including home renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston homeowners, with a median budget of $704,000, outspent remodelers in 74 other U.S. metro markets, according to an analysis of building permits for high-end projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its analysis, BuildFax, a building-permit data company, tallied the top 10% most-expensive home remodeling permits issued between 2012 and 2016 in the 100 most populous U.S. metros. Some cities, such as New York and San Francisco, were omitted, because the municipalities either didn't provide project costs or didn't specify the type of work done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are feeling really good about the city, and the amount of money they can put into their houses," said Stephen McNiel of Creative Property Restoration, a builder in Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are fueling big-budget projects. First, a shortage of luxury listings in desirable parts of the city is driving up home prices. The average sale price of a luxury home in Houston was nearly $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, up 3.6% from the same period a year ago, said Chaille Ralph, president of Heritage Texas Properties. Faced with steep home prices, some homeowners find that it's more economical to renovate their current home with luxury amenities, Ms. Ralph explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices give many remodelers the confidence to undertake big projects in the hopes they'll see a return on their investment, said Paul Emrath with the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, much of the newer stock was built about 25 years ago, and is primed for a wave of remodeling, Ms. Ralph added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the River Oaks area of Houston, real-estate agent Mike Mahlstedt and his partner, Kyle Dutton, bought a 3,500-square-foot, 1940s home for about $1.2 million in 2014. A year later, the couple completed a $750,000 remodel that included a 500-bottle wine room and a custom kitchen with Brazilian soapstone. Mr. Mahlstedt, 40, says they never formally listed the home, but it's now under contract for close to their asking price of $2.15 million. "When I see opportunities, I jump on them," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Leigh Kamping-Carder </div><div>1129 words</div><div>14 April 2017</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took artist Don Greenwood about 20 minutes to decide to buy his Park City, Utah, vacation home. So far, he has spent about a year and a half trying to sell it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenwood, 80, and his wife, Ginny, no longer ski, so they want to buy a beach house closer to their home in San Diego. They first listed the 8,825-square-foot home -- which sits on the mountain in the Bald Eagle Estates neighborhood of Deer Valley Resort -- in August 2015 for $11.5 million. It is now asking $10.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenwood may have a difficult time selling at that price because of the competition from newly built properties in the area, said Carol Agle of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Utah Properties, who isn't affiliated with the listing. "We believe that it's priced at the market," said Mr. Greenwood, who paid $4.4 million for the property in 2009 and said he rebuilt the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Greenwood said playing the waiting game is fine with him. His three children and 13 grandchildren use the home, he has no debt on the house, his property taxes are manageable and showings aren't an inconvenience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the high-end market soared in 2014 and 2015, many ultraluxury sellers listed their homes for top-end prices, only to find their properties sitting when the market slowed last year. In response, many sellers cut their prices to more realistic numbers, aiming for a quick deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not the holdouts. These are the sellers willing to spend months, if not years, waiting to sign a contract. Some own multiple homes; others have done the math and concluded it is financially and personally beneficial to wait (and wait) to strike a deal. "In most cases my sellers don't have to sell," said Mr. Greenwood's agent, Ann MacQuoid of <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more expensive the home, the more likely it is to sit: Homes in the highest price bracket spent a median 134 days on market, versus 100 days for luxury homes overall and 53 days for the typical home, according to Realtor.com, which examined the priciest 10% of 44,000 listings in the 20 largest U.S. metro areas in February. About 9.5% of luxury homes spent more than a year on the market. (<span class="companylink">News Corp</span>., owner of the Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real-estate agents warn that holding out is usually a bad idea. Testing the market, or listing at an eye-popping number in the off-chance a buyer materializes, often means missing out on buyers who would have been interested if the property were priced correctly, as well as wasting the most important window of time to appeal to them, said Samantha DeBianchi, founder of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based DeBianchi Real Estate. "The first 30 days are everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents particularly note that buyers can be wary of "stale" listings, assuming something is wrong with the home or lowballing the seller, believing they can get a bargain. According to a report from Concierge Auctions, which examined the 10 priciest sales in 27 high-end housing markets using public property records and multiple-listing service data, homes that took longer than 180 days to sell spent an average 774 days on market and fetched 77% of their original list price. Homes that spent under 180 days on market sold in an average of 80 days for 93% of the initial price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few reasons why higher-end homes tend to sit around longer. Fewer comparable sales make it more difficult to value them. High-end buyers, too, can afford to take their time, since they are more likely to be making discretionary home purchases. Some homes fail to sell because of a major flaw -- a funky layout, undesirable location or idiosyncratic decor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most common reason a home sits is a too-high price. Wealthy sellers can often afford to be more stubborn. Some agents acquiesce to unrealistic asking prices just to get a listing, hoping to later convince the seller to drop the price. Meanwhile, the home languishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Sciame, 65, is one well-known holdout. The real-estate developer made headlines when he relisted two homes in Old Saybrook, Conn., including Katharine Hepburn's longtime retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sciame bought Ms. Hepburn's 3 1/2-acre property for $6 million in 2004, a year after she died, and divided it into three lots. He first listed the three properties for a total of $28 million in 2011. Since then, he has listed them off and on at different prices. He built a beach house on one of the lots in 2015. The main house is now asking $11.8 million; the beach house, $5.88 million. (He will keep the third lot.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price is likely relying on the Hepburn name and still too high, said Joel Lucas of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span>, given the competition for high-end buyers from the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span> and other parts of the New England coast. Listing agent Colette Harron of William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty said the town has appraised the main house at $11.1888 million, and Mr. Sciame has received an offer higher than the current asking price. "But they were not ready to sell," she said. "Now they are ready to sell."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Walton and Stacy Demcher of Keller Williams Jersey Shore specialize in "expired listings" that have failed to sell. For an expired listing, Mr. Walton said he typically adjusts the price, rewrites the copy and takes new photographs. Some agents will delist a home for a short period to reset the days-on-market number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pete Parisette moved to his family's South Kingstown, R.I., home 11 years ago to look after his mother, now 88, after his father died. The owner of an exotic-wood-veneer firm, Mr. Parisette travels for work, and the home is too much for his mother, who has health concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he said that an agent told him he could do a fast deal with a $1 million price, he asked $1.8 million for the 3,843-square-foot home in June, citing other local sales. After a refinancing, he relisted it in September for $1.575 million. The election and the winter delayed a sale, he said, but now he is hopeful he will get offers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn home sales soared during the first quarter as median and average prices set records, according to market reports released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Springtime came early to Brooklyn," noted a report by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> that found that the first quarter had the highest number of sales for a first quarter since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a Brooklyn home was $770,000, up 16% from the first quarter of 2016, according to a report by brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of a surge in sales of expensive new condominiums, the average price was up by 25% to $993,955.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts attributed the pop in activity to the boom in new development sales, along with some of the same factors driving sales higher across the country: shrinking inventory[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/buying-a-home-will-be-harder-than-ever-this-spring-1491048002] and worries about interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran report cited improving consumer confidence, after buyers hesitated last year in the face of high prices and uncertainty heading into the presidential election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report found that the median price of a new condominium rose 90% to $1.44 million, while sales of older condominiums rose 15.5% to $824,000. Inventory was down almost 20%, and the number of months needed to sell the current home inventory fell from 4.5 months to 2.5 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Townhouses also posted record median and average prices in the first quarter, according to a report by Brown Harris Stevens. The median townhouse price was $870,000, up 6.7% from the first quarter of 2016, the report found.</p>
