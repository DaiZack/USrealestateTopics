<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a slightly stronger pace at the end of last year than earlier estimated, but while growth is expected to rebound sharply to start 2006, fresh readings on home sales and consumer confidence hinted at bumps on the road ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, grew at a 1.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter, compared with the 1.1% pace reported earlier. Stronger inventory building by businesses bolstered growth, but consumer outlays, which account for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose just 1.2%, well below the third quarter's 4.1% advance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown is widely expected to be temporary. A poll of forecasters released this week by the National Association for Business Economics sees first-quarter GDP rising 4.5%, then settling into a 3.3% pace for all of 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro of Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. wrote in a note that neither the slow growth of the fourth quarter nor the expected rebound to start this year are likely to last. "Our forecasts for the subsequent three quarters of the year, which call for growth of a little under 3%, are more reflective of sustainable rates of expansion," he wrote.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which has provided a boost to economic growth for several years, is beginning to show signs of slowing. A report from the National Association of Realtors yesterday showed sales of existing homes fell 2.8% in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.56 million units. Sales of condominiums and co-ops were particularly weak, falling 10.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Existing-home sales should stay below the record levels experienced for the last two years, but they'll maintain a historically high pace," said David Lereah, chief economist of the Realtors association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was unchanged from December at $211,000. The inventory of existing homes for sale rose to 5.3 months, compared with December's unrevised 5.1 months, the Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported Monday that new-home sales dropped 5% in January, while the inventory of unsold new homes rose 2.5% to the highest level in nearly a decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Conference Board, a private research group, said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence for February fell to 101.7 from a revised 106.8 in January. The present-situation index, a gauge of consumers' views of current conditions, rose to 129.3 from 128.8 the prior month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients that while confidence readings appear to run in sympathy with the twists and turns in gasoline prices, "it is also possible that the softening housing market is beginning to affect people's views of the future."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though consumers' confidence has sputtered, they have continued to spend. The International Council of Shopping Centers said its index of sales at retail chain-stores increased 1.5% in the week ended Feb. 25 on a seasonally adjusted, comparable-store basis, according to data released yesterday.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Market Signals Slowdown --- New-Home Sales Decline To Slowest Pace in a Year, And Unsold Supply Jumps</span>
</div><div class="author">By Christopher Conkey </div><div>465 words</div><div>28 February 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales fell in January and the number of unsold homes on the market rose to nearly a 10-year high, signaling continued cooling in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau said sales of new single-family homes dropped 5% last month to an annual rate of 1.23 million units, the slowest pace in a year. Slower sales and rising inventories pushed the number of unsold homes up 2.5% in January to 528,000, a 5.2-month supply. That is the highest level of unsold new homes on the market in nearly a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists were surprised by the January decline, having anticipated that unseasonably warm weather last month would boost sales, much as it had stimulated big jumps in housing starts, retail sales and construction. Instead, sales in the Northeast, South and Midwest all dropped more than 10% from December, overshadowing an 11.3% rise in the West. Rising interest rates and lower levels of mortgage applications in recent weeks have further darkened the outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, January's sales rate was 3.3% higher than a year ago, and yesterday's report was viewed as the latest evidence that the housing market is undergoing a gradual slowdown rather than a sharp freefall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Activity seems to be merely moving away from the frenetic pace of activity in 2005," wrote Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc., in a research note. "The slowdown could be viewed as desirable, as speculative elements had entered the market last year and prospects for bubble-like conditions had increased."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census report is unlikely to have much bearing on the Federal Reserve's decision whether to raise its target for short-term interest rates. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress that "some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the declining sales, the Census report said the median price of a new home rose to $238,100, up 4% from December and nearly 7% from a year ago. That's the highest point since the median price hit $243,900 in October. The January price increase followed two consecutive monthly declines. Today, the National Association of Realtors will release figures on existing home sales and prices for January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales report weighed on the stocks of major home builders. On a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced, the share prices of Toll Brothers Inc., Ryland Group Inc., KB Home, Centex Corp. and Beazer Homes USA Inc. all lost ground. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Woes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past several years, the big regret among home buyers was that they hadn't bought sooner, when houses were cheaper. But some people who bought in the past several months probably may regret not waiting until prices got cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's report on new-home sales from the Commerce Department should give some indication of just how hard those recent buyers are kicking themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by and CNBC estimate sales bumped up slightly in January, to an annualized 1,270,000 from December's 1,231,000. That lines up with homebuilder surveys from research firm ISI Group. January's warm weather was one reason for the pickup in sales -- but not the only one, according to Oscar Sloterbeck, head of ISI's survey group. Many builders have been throwing in sweeteners, like flat-panel TVs and better floors, to push sales without having to lower prices. Even so, Mr. Sloterbeck believes some builders have lowered prices to bring customers in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is in keeping with what was happening in previous months. In December, the average price of a new home was $272,900, according to the Commerce Department. That was 8.9% below September's $299,600 -- the biggest three-month percentage drop on record. The median price (as opposed to the average price) fell by a slightly smaller 7.7% to $221,800. That is an indication that more expensive homes have seen the steepest price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for existing (that is, previously owned) homes, on the other hand, have registered only slight declines. One reason is that builders are much more motivated sellers than the average homeowner is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if prices for existing homes stay put, that may present other problems, says Lehman Brothers economist Joe Abate. Homeowners have used rising home values to fuel their spending, usually extracting money through mortgage refinancing. If home prices aren't rising, that spending spigot could run dry. Moreover, long-term interest rates are expected to rise, which could further crimp the refinancing game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big unknown, says Bollinger Capital Management head John Bollinger, is what will recent buyers -- many of whom have put down little or no cash to buy their homes -- do if the real-estate slowdown steepens. They may not be as motivated to hang on to their homes as traditional homeowners, he thinks, and many may end up simply handing lenders their keys.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kirsti McCabe </div><div>1523 words</div><div>18 February 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS THE REAL-ESTATE MARKET cools and it becomes tougher to sell in a hurry, the chance of ending up carrying two homes -- and two mortgages -- is increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is causing a rising number of sellers to turn to bridge loans, which are interim financing arrangements used to fund the down payment on a new house and help cover the mortgages on two homes. When houses were selling more quickly -- as recently as a few months ago -- people were more likely to pounce on a new home before they sealed a deal to sell their old home, confident a strong market would work in their favor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually no more than 10% of home buyers get caught sitting on two mortgages even when the real-estate cycle is turning, says Norm Miller, director of the Real Estate Center at the University of Cincinnati. "But when the market is starting to slow," he says, "you'll certainly see more people caught in that circumstance. It may have been 5% before; now it may be 10%, but even more in hyperactive markets" like California and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market is climbing sharply in many parts of the country. There were 2.8 million existing houses and condominiums on the market at year end, up 26% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. While existing-home sales were still strong in the fourth quarter, rising at the third-highest pace on record, the association said it expects sales of existing homes to fall 4.7% this year, compared with a 4.2% rise in 2005, and median home prices to rise an average of 5%, slowing from a 12.7% gain last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just six months ago, "sellers were calling the shots," says Mike Mahfouz, senior vice president and divisional manager at GMAC Mortgage in Paramus, N.J. He says six to 24 months ago, fewer than 5% of the mortgage lender's customers nationwide were taking bridge loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tide is changing. "Now it's become more of a buyer's market, or a balanced market shifting in the buyer's favor," making bridge loans more popular among potential buyers, Mr. Mahfouz says. "Now we're seeing upwards of 10% of our customers applying for bridge loans. It's a just-in-case strategy so they don't have to scramble to get financing if they can't sell their current home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing is critical. If you buy before selling, you run the risk of having to pay two mortgages. If you sell before buying, you could end up homeless. It is a puzzle that comes with stress from all corners, from making sure your children get enrolled in school on time to avoiding spousal warfare over whether to accept an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right along with marriage, death and divorce, moving can be one of the most stressful things in people's lives, especially when you're trying to buy a house and sell your old place at the same time," says Kim Soule, a senior associate with the Corcoran Group in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some tips on managing the buy-sell dilemma:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too often homeowners neglect to consider recent sales in their own neighborhoods. Before listing your home, research sales prices of homes comparable to yours and talk to brokers in your area to check how long homes sat on the market. Also, investigate the latest market forecasts. The National Association of Realtors' Web site ( www.realtor.org[http://www.realtor.org] ) provides forecasts for national trends, while regional Realtor associations offer guidance on local markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have bought a new home but can't sell your current home, holding out for your initial asking price can backfire in the long run. While a disappointment, cutting your price sooner rather than later can significantly stem the cost of maintaining two homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a buyer's point of view, a home-sale contingency contract is the only bulletproof way to ensure you don't have to close on a house if you can't sell your current home, says Kenneth Haber, general counsel at Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contingencies are written clauses in your contract, giving you time to secure financing or evaluate some aspect of the property before you proceed to closing. If the contingencies aren't met, the wording should allow you to back out of the contract at no penalty. Some sellers will agree to a contingency in the contract that says the sale is dependent on the buyer selling his current home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are only likely to agree to this type of contingency if the market is slow and offers are below par. Some sellers may compromise and suggest a contingency clause allowing them to keep their house on the market but giving the buyer right of first refusal if another offer comes through before the buyer has sold his house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have purchased a new home but haven't sold your old one, consider renting your home temporarily while you keep it on the market, even if it means offering a deal to renters in exchange for permission to show the place. You will at least get income to cover your mortgage or other costs. With mortgage rates rising, the rental market is expected to get stronger in many areas of the country, and it may be a lucrative move if you can't close on a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have sold your home but haven't yet found a new one, consider a rent-back situation, paying rent to the new owners, to extend your moving date. You may want to offer to cut your selling price if the buyer is flexible on the occupancy date and will allow you to stay in your house for a certain period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers may step in to offer perks to make the deal go through. If a seller is trying to extend the closing date but the buyer needs to get into the new place, brokers sometimes offer to cover the costs of temporary quarters for their client just to seal the deal. One broker offered to pay for hotel accommodations when a deal was about to collapse. "I'm not going to let a deal fall apart over one week when we're talking about $4 million worth of real estate," she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                             Bridging the Gap 
 
  Here are some financing arrangements that could help you cover your down 
payment and closing costs if you buy a new home before you sell your old one. 
 
  Bridge Loan 
 
  Short-term financing intended to fund your down payment and closing costs 
while waiting to sell your house. The loans are usually short-term and carry 
high interest rates. 
 
  -- Pros: Provides flexibility by allowing a home buyer to proceed with 
closing a deal to buy a new house before selling his or her current home. 
 
  -- Cons: If potential buyers become aware that the homeowner has secured a 
bridge loan, it can serve as a red flag that the homeowner is under pressure 
to sell, which could elicit lower offers. 
 
  Bridge Loan With Deferred Interest Payments 
 
  The bank provides a loan that pays off the current mortgage and allows the 
seller to use remaining funds to finance the down payment and closing costs 
on a new home purchase. The payment on the bridge loan is deferred for a set 
amount of time, usually six to nine months, while the homeowner tries to 
sell the existing home. When the borrower sells the home, he repays the 
bridge loan plus the interest. 
 
  -- Pros: The home buyer eliminates mortgage payments on the old house and 
the bridge loan payment is deferred. The upside for the seller is he seals 
the deal to sell his house without having to agree to a contingency on the 
sale, such as waiting until the home buyer sells his existing house before 
closing. 
 
  -- Cons: If a person is unable to sell his home before the term of the 
bridge loan expires, he will owe the interest that has accrued in one 
lump-sum payment. The bank may offer to extend the loan until a sale goes 
through but the borrower will still be liable for the interest that accrued 
during the first term of the loan. 
 
  100% Financing on the New Mortgage 
 
  The home buyer obtains 100% financing on the new mortgage and needs no 
down payment for the home, allowing him to buy even if he hasn't yet sold 
his current house, providing the buyer can get approved to hold two 
mortgages. 
 
  -- Pros: Allows the buyer to proceed with purchase without getting a 
bridge loan. 
 
  -- Cons: Mortgages with 100% financing are considered high-risk mortgages, 
primarily because they have allowed many people to purchase homes they can't 
really afford.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home builders broke ground at the fastest pace in more than three decades last month, as unusually warm weather trumped signs of a weakening market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts surged 14.5% last month from December to an annual rate of 2.28 million units. Housing starts were up 4% from a year earlier. Permits for new residential buildings rose 6.8% in January from December levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expected a rebound in housing starts after an 8.9% decline in December, but few said they expected such a strong surge. Mild weather in many parts of the country last month -- also a factor underpinning strong retail sales and employment growth in the period -- was cited widely as the main factor behind the surge. Many analysts predict a slowdown in the housing market in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The January number is an aberration that doesn't mean anything," said Patrick Newport, an economist at Global Insight, an economic-analysis firm. "We're going to see a big drop in February and then a gradual slowing for the rest of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists warned of overbuilding, saying recent declines in mortgage applications and rising inventories of unsold homes point to waning demand. The upward trend in interest rates also is causing concern. Freddie Mac said yesterday that the average interest rate on the standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.28% last week from 5.62% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Gerber, vice president of production at Bogdan Builders, a luxury-condominium builder in Bethesda, Md., said his firm had received five times as many contracts in January as it did in December. Still, he says, Bogdan is having a harder time selling units now. The company is into its third month of sales for a 14-unit condo complex in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C. "A year and a half ago, we had a 12-unit condo building sell out in four hours," Mr. Gerber said. "Those days are over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Labor Department said 297,000 people filed initial claims for unemployment benefits last week, up 19,000 from the week before. The four-week moving average of claims, closely watched because it paints a less volatile picture of labor-market conditions, was 283,000, up 6,250 from the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with recent indicators showing strong gains in wage growth, the jobless-claims data suggest the unemployment rate might fall in the months ahead even lower than the current 4.7% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said prices for imports and exports rose in January. Import prices increased 1.3% from December, driven by a 6.4% jump in oil prices. Export prices rose 0.7%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar was higher Thursday morning, building on Wednesday's positive reaction to testimony from new U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In morning New York trading, the euro was at $1.1872, down from $1.1888 late Wednesday. The dollar rose to 118.14 yen from 117.86 yen, and to 1.3133 Swiss francs from 1.3108 francs. The pound slipped to $1.7342 from $1.7405.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were encouraged on the near-term prospects for the dollar after Mr. Bernanke's testimony Wednesday, when he told U.S. lawmakers that "some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary." Though many analysts expect the dollar to fall later in the year, its near-term prospects are expected to be governed by anticipation of how much further the Fed will raise rates. Mr. Bernanke was scheduled to testify for a second day Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar extended its gains slightly after the U.S. reported that home construction surged to a 33-year high amid record warm weather in January. Housing starts increased 14.5% to a seasonally adjusted 2.276 million annual pace, its best level since March 1973, compared with a revised 1.933 million rate in December. Economists had projected a 5.3% increase.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1415 words</div><div>16 February 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER CLIMBING steadily for a decade, the nation's homeownership rate appears to have leveled off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data released late last month by the U.S. Census Bureau put the homeownership rate at 69% in the fourth quarter of 2005, down from 69.2% a year earlier. While the decline itself is too small to be considered statistically significant, it is the third quarter in a row that the rate hasn't posted a year-over-year gain -- and it's the first time since 1994 that the rate at year-end hasn't increased from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not entirely clear why the homeownership rate seems to have plateaued. Some economists say that the new data could be a sign that declining affordability is finally taking its toll on first-time homebuyers. Other possible explanations include economic weakness in the Midwest, where the drop in the rate is sharpest (down to 72.8% in the fourth quarter from 73.7% a year earlier), and demographic shifts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The portion of U.S. population who own homes began climbing in the mid-1990s, propelled by moderate interest rates and strong economic growth. It has continued to move higher, bolstered by low interest rates, creative mortgage financing and the desire of many Americans to get in on the housing boom. The homeownership rate reached an all-time high of 69.2% in the second quarter of 2004, up from 63.8% a decade earlier. Since then, it has edged sideways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got seven quarters in which the homeownership rate basically has done nothing," says Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist for Goldman Sachs. "It's fair to say that it's stagnating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, home prices have surged. The median price for an existing single-family home was $213,000 in the fourth quarter, up 13.6% from a year earlier, though home-price growth cooled somewhat in the fourth quarter, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. A record 72 of 145 metro areas showed double-digit annual increases in median prices for existing single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say it will take several more quarters to determine whether the homeownership rate has actually peaked or temporarily stalled. Because the Census Bureau estimates are based on a monthly survey of roughly 61,000 occupied homes, there's also the possibility of a sampling error. And even if the homeownership rate has flattened, the actual number of homeowners is increasing because of population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the latest numbers come at a time when rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are making it tough for many homebuyers. Affordability isn't a problem in many parts of the country, but buyers are being squeezed in a growing number of locales. In 25 of 143 metro areas nationwide, homes were so expensive in the fourth quarter that a family earning the median income couldn't afford the median-priced home, based on conventional lending standards, according to a study prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Moody's Economy.com, a unit of Moody's Corp. By comparison, 13 of 151 metro areas were considered unaffordable two years ago. Affordability has even dropped in the Midwest, where home-price growth has been modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with ever-rising prices, many borrowers have turned to creative mortgage products. These include loans with low teaser rates, interest-only mortgages and so-called piggyback loans, which allow borrowers to buy a home even if they lack the money for a traditional down payment. But rising short-term interest rates have made some of these products less attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' Affordability Index now stands at 115.8, the lowest level since the third quarter of 1991. When the index stands at 100, a family earning the median income has just enough money to afford the median-priced home, assuming a 20% down payment and current interest rates. Forty-three percent of first-time homebuyers purchased a home with no money down, according to the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In some parts of the country, affordability has fallen to levels we have not seen in 20 years," says David Berson, chief economist at mortgage giant Fannie Mae. As prices climb, some buyers have trouble coming up with money for a down payment. Others lose out because home prices are rising faster than their incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be other explanations for the flattening of the homeownership rate. Job losses and weak economic growth in the Midwest may play a major role, says Eric Belsky, executive director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Additionally, as the economy expands, some people are relocating to the South and West to take advantage of new job opportunities, he says. Some of these people may decide initially to rent rather than buy, even if they can afford a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographic factors may also be a factor. Baby boomers are nearing the age where their homeownership rate peaks, says Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Recent immigrants are also less likely to own homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, renting can be a wiser choice than owning for many people, including those of limited means and people who expect to move shortly. There are signs that rising home prices may be leading some to choose renting over buying. The rental vacancy rate declined to 9.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to 10% at the end of last year and a high of 10.4% in the first quarter of 2004, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest homeownership data are also notable because they come at a time of strong home sales. Sales of existing homes set their fifth consecutive record last year, climbing 4.2% to 7.07 million, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disconnect between record home sales and a stagnant homeownership rate suggests that the recent growth in sales is being fueled in part by investor activity, says David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. Investors accounted for 9.5% of mortgages to buy homes in the first 10 months of 2005, according to LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growth in second homes could also play a role, some economists say. Buyers of second homes accounted for 7.35% of mortgages to purchase homes through October, according to LoanPerformance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other indications of investor buying. While vacancy rates for rental properties declined overall, vacancy rates for one-unit rentals, which are typically owned by investors, climbed to 10.2% in the fourth quarter of 2005 from 9.6% a year earlier, according to the Census Bureau. Housing analysts say the growth of investor-owned units represents a "shadow supply" of rental properties that doesn't show up in traditional rental market measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners may also be taking advantage of recent increases in home values and cashing out as the housing market cools. Christopher Olsen, a financial planner in Lodi, Calif., decided he needed a bigger home with a new baby on the way. But instead of trading up, Mr. Lodi sold his three-bedroom, two-bath house for $406,000 in May -- $26,000 more than his broker's estimate of the home's value -- and moved into a rental property. "We are renting for two years, waiting for the market to settle, or crash," says Mr. Olsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dip in homeownership was greatest among blacks and baby boomers ages 45 to 64. The homeownership rate for blacks stood at 48% at year-end, compared with 49.1% a year earlier. "The house-price runup in many metro areas has put housing further out of reach of many minority families," says Stuart Gabriel, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California.</p>

  -- Weak economic growth in the Midwest. 
  -- Demographic shifts, such as immigration and the aging of baby boomers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home builder KB Home reported a surge in cancellations and a drop in orders in the past two months, the latest indication that the hot U.S. housing market appears to be cooling and a sign that the softening may not be limited to the luxury segment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disclosure from KB Home follows last week's announcement from high-end builder Toll Brothers Inc. that new orders fell sharply in the first quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are signs that consumer demand in the U.S. residential housing at current prices is softening," Los Angeles-based KB Home said in its annual report, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company noted that the U.S. Census Bureau reported last month that single-family housing starts in December fell 12% from November and about 8% from a year earlier. The bureau also reported that the median sales price for new homes fell about 3% in December from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our results to date in fiscal year 2006 reflect these broader market trends," said KB Home, whose fiscal year ends Nov. 30. "In the first two months of the [fiscal] year, we have experienced an increase in home-order cancellations and a decline in net orders for new homes when compared to the same period last year."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home said in the filing that if this trend continues, it likely will have to lower its revenue forecast for the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Toll Brothers, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, said orders for new homes in its first quarter ended Jan. 31 declined 29% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That decline, on top of the recent housing data, fueled concerns that a long-predicted correction in the U.S. housing market had finally arrived, though many observers pointed out that less interest in high-end homes didn't necessarily signal a slowdown in the broader market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UBS analyst Margaret Whelan said she expects KB Home's orders to be down 10% in its fiscal first quarter, ending Feb. 28. "Demand is definitely down -- there's no doubt about it," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Ms. Whelan added that, if the sector manages a "soft landing" rather than a crash, large, publicly traded home builders could maintain growth by gaining market share from smaller, less-liquid builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KB Home said it doesn't expect to change its earnings-per-share outlook for fiscal 2006, since it has accelerated its share-buyback program. In December, the company said it expected to generate earnings of $11.25 a share in fiscal 2006, up 18% from the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In afternoon trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, KB Home shares were up 43 cents at $66.38.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial Space</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Displays Strength</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the polo grounds and the $735-a-day bungalow-style cabanas that fuel Palm Beach County's longstanding reputation as a playground for the rich and famous lies one of the U.S.'s healthiest warehouse and office markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents and values in the commercial real-estate market in Palm Beach County -- located just north of Miami, along more than 40 miles of Florida coastline and stretching west toward the Everglades and acres of cane-sugar fields -- have benefited from something of a perfect storm. A robust economy and the residential-condominium boom have increased competition for available property, while environmental restrictions have damped new supply, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strength of the demand for office and warehouse space is at times defying logic, as investors betting on appreciation pay more for office buildings than rents can support, said Rebel Cook, a real-estate broker who is president of the Economic Forum of Palm Beach County. Even roof damage sustained by some buildings during Hurricane Wilma last fall increased pressure for office space, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This landlords' market is emerging as employment levels in the county -- driven by tourism, as well as by a strong professional-and-business sector that includes lawyers and doctors who service the super-wealthy drawn to the exclusive island of Palm Beach -- rose 2.5% in December from the year earlier, outpacing the national rate of 1.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's above-average population growth has helped push demand for housing: Median single-family-home prices more than doubled to $408,200 in December from $194,600 at the close of 2002, though sales slowed in December from the year-earlier period, according to the Florida Association of Realtors. A cooling housing market is a risk for the county's economy, which depends on housing-related jobs for about 12.4% of employment, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the warehouse sector is the strongest market, according to PPR. Warehouse vacancy rates fell to 4.3% in the fourth quarter, the second-tightest market of the 54 metro areas tracked by PPR after Seattle. Average prices paid per square foot rose to $103 last year from $75 in 2004, well above the national average of $63 a square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc. of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the area could price itself out of reach of some businesses. Levenger Co., a reading-tool and home-furnishing retailer, is moving its distribution center from Delray Beach, Fla., to a 250,000-square-foot site in Memphis, Tenn., said Chief Executive Steve Leveen. Mr. Leveen said lower space and shipping costs in Memphis prompted the relocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the office sector, vacancies dropped to 13.8% in the fourth quarter from 16.5% a year earlier, well below the national rate of 17.6%. Average prices fetched by buildings rose to $167 a square foot last year from $144 the year earlier, about midway between the Southeast region's average of $141 and the national level of $190, according to Real Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The challenges facing new development in the region were highlighted last year, when construction on a planned 350,000-square-foot lab-and-research facility for Scripps Research Institute was halted after a federal judge found that a more expansive study of the project's environmental impact was warranted, said Keith McKeown, a Scripps spokesman.Yesterday, the county picked a new site in Jupiter, Fla., for Scripps' first major facility outside its La Jolla, Calif., headquarters, Mr. McKeown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, an average of at least 550,000 square feet of new office space is expected to be completed annually for the next five years, and that could halt the decline in office vacancies, PPR said. A joint venture between Crocker Partners LLC of Boca Raton, Fla., and Related Cos. LP of New York plans to break ground next month on an 18-story building that would be West Palm Beach's first new office tower in almost 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development in the retail sector is also expected to push up vacancies over the next few years, though above-average median incomes and an increase in residents in their prime spending years of 35 to 54 will keep demand strong, PPR said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Home Front: Clouds Over Condos --- Survey of Five Cities Shows Inventories, Incentives Up; Throwing In Opera Tickets</span>
</div><div class="author">By Amir Efrati </div><div>2227 words</div><div>10 February 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN BOSTON, a condominium developer is asking new owners to help it promote its unsold units, while another is putting in hardwood floors free. In Sarasota, Fla., sellers of condos are offering buyers incentives such as exclusive golf-club memberships worth as much as $75,000. In Atlanta, the developer of a high-rise is promising shoppers it will pay their first year of condo-association fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perks being offered by sellers? Until recently, buyers in many markets were competing for the chance to snap up new condos downtown. But even as many cities continue to see condo prices appreciate, there are spreading signs that the market may be cooling, just as in the overall market. The worry for investors is that this real-estate slowdown will mirror that of the early 1990s, when condo values in some markets dropped more sharply than those of single-family homes, in part because many had been bought by speculators -- the same kind of speculative buying that has fueled this era's boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see how condominiums are faring this time around, we took a look at five U.S. cities, aiming for regional spread and active markets: Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Diego and Sarasota, Fla. We began by interviewing local real-estate brokers, market analysts, buyers and sellers. We also reviewed data on everything from price-per-square-foot appreciation to the change in the number of condos on the market over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The similarities were striking. While all of the downtown condo markets had strong overall sales in 2005, their resale markets showed signs of struggle. In San Diego, where condo prices more than doubled from 2001 to 2005, inventory (units being sold by owners, not developers) rose more than 80% in 2005, according to local agent Lew Breeze. In the same period, inventory in Minneapolis tripled, according to Barry Berg of Coldwell Banker Burnet. In Las Vegas, the epicenter of the condo boom, at least four condo projects have been scrapped, including Icon Las Vegas, which had already sold contracts for units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, a lot could change this spring, a time when real-estate transactions traditionally pick up. The combination of an overall strong economy, low long-term interest rates and the migration of baby boomers to city centers is likely to "mitigate a softening" in condo prices, says Karl Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below is our survey of downtown condo markets in five cities across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN A SNAPSHOT: To drive up sales and per-square-foot prices, developers have shrunk condo units 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo market in Atlanta's core "intown" areas -- Downtown, Midtown and Buckhead -- took off after the city hosted the Summer Olympics in 1996, and sales have continued at a record pace. Last year, 4,089 condos were sold in the area, a 34% jump according to data tracker Smart Numbers, which gathers data from a multiple-listing service and property deeds. The median price per square foot for new construction also rose 10% to $247 after dropping 2% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, median sales prices for intown condos fell 1% last year because of a burst of new, cheap units. To drive sales, developers have reduced condo-unit sizes. According to Smart Numbers, median condo size dropped 12% to 972 square feet from 2004 to 2005. Developers also have begun to offer incentives. At Paces 325, a high-rise in Buckhead that was completed in mid-2004, the developer recently began offering to pay homeowners-association dues ($270 to $450 a month) for new buyers for a year. Why? Half of the building's 206 units, priced from the $190,000s to $400,000s, are unsold. The incentive "comes and goes as needed," says Jennifer Rust, the sales manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers of existing condos are also coming up with inducements. Lenaya Miller, a real-estate agent who sold her six-year-old condo near Midtown in October for $164,000, says she paid the buyer's first year of homeowners-association fees ($5,000) and the closing costs ($4,900). "To be competitive, I gave them everything but the shirt off my back," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN A SNAPSHOT: Median condo price per square foot rose 11% last year to $617; existing condo sales fell 30% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of price appreciation and sales, downtown-Boston condos peaked in 2004. But it wasn't until the last quarter of last year that developers and sellers of existing condos really started to feel the impact -- as condo resales fell 30% from a year earlier, according to Listing Information Network, a real-estate data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To spur sales, developers are offering everything from free upgrades to shopping sprees. One is Porter 156, a 217-unit condo conversion completed last fall in a former bra factory. The building, in East Boston, has about 25 unsold new loft-style units and 25 just-purchased units on the market for $300,000 to the mid-$600,000s, local agent Brian Perry says. That has prompted its developers, ELV Associates and Metric Construction, to turn to residents for help: During the December holidays, the developers left cards in owners' apartments offering a $1,000 gift certificate to Ikea for owners who found buyers for any remaining units. The developer of Parris Landing at the Navy Yard, completed in 2004, is giving buyers free upgrades on features such as hardwood floors ($10,000) and is writing off condo fees for a year ($400 to $700 a month).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minneapolis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN A SNAPSHOT: While a major correction is unlikely, local analysts say they expect a lull in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Midwestern city has enjoyed some notable expansion in the past few years. Not only has the downtown area's population increased by a third, to 30,300, since 2000, it has a new theater, public library and some museum expansions planned for later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo market has experienced a parallel boom, with 1,326 units selling last year, up from 557 in 2004, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors. And compared with the other markets we looked at, the city had fewer speculators and smaller price increases, making it less susceptible to major corrections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But things have slowed recently. There were four sales of existing condos in January, compared with 27 a year earlier, according to MAAR, and brokers say shoppers are taking longer to buy. That has prompted developers to take the initiative. One example is the 39-story Carlyle, which is scheduled for completion in December. Developers APEX Asset Management and Opus have presold 240 of the building's 255 units, taking down-payments of 5% to 10% on units costing $250,000 to $1.5 million. In hopes of keeping those buyers from backing out of their contracts, the developers have treated them to bicycle tours of downtown, a group trip to a University of Minnesota Gophers football game and a private holiday party in December at the newly renovated Walker Art Center. The idea is to create a sense of community, says Bob Lux, a principal at APEX. "Instead of spending the money on marketing, we were able to spend that money on our existing residents," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN A SNAPSHOT: Prices dropped from the end of 2004 to the end of 2005 -- the first such drop since 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the condo markets we surveyed, San Diego showed the strongest signs of a slowdown. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the median price per square foot for downtown condos fell to 0.2% to $517 from a year earlier -- the first year-over-year drop since 2001, according to London Group Realty Advisors, a research firm. San Diego also had an 82% rise in inventory of existing condos last year as speculators stopped buying. Many also backed out of contracts and forfeited their downpayments: In San Diego County, the number of canceled purchase agreements for new condos and townhouses jumped by 75%, to 264, from the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 2005, according to MarketPointe Realty Advisors, a local market-analysis firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Rachelle Amini, such developments strengthened her bargaining position when she found a two-bedroom condo in a downtown high-rise last fall. The 28-year-old psychotherapist says she talked the investor-seller down to $1.15 million -- $50,000 less than he had paid for it in 2004. He also threw in two plasma TVs and a new white sofa. "It was definitely a good deal," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, downtown San Diego has continued to expand rapidly. Since 2001, the population has risen by about 12,000, to about 30,000, according to Centre City Development Corp., a nonprofit downtown-redevelopment group. And since the completion in 2004 of Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres baseball team, the East Village district has done especially well, adding retail and office developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarasota, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN A SNAPSHOT: An overbuilt downtown condo market is leading to incentives such as deals on beach-club memberships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown market has been on a tear since the Ritz-Carlton, which included 50 residences atop the hotel, was completed in 2001. More than a dozen condo projects have been built since then in this city of 55,000, and there are as many units under construction now as have been completed over the past six years. Plus, about 273 condos are on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's almost triple the amount of condos on the market here a year ago, according to real-estate firm Michael Saunders &amp;Co. And more continue to be announced, including Marquee on the Bay, a 16-story tower with 12 units starting at 4,750 square feet for $3 million, and the Grande Sarasotan, with 144 condominium units priced from $1 million to $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Where are the people going to come from?" says broker Barbara Ackerman, who predicts the median condo price in downtown will drop a "minimum of 10%" this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January is typically a slow month here, but this year there were six condos that resold, down from 14 in January 2005, according to Michael Saunders &amp;Co. It's no longer uncommon for sellers to offer hard-to-get golf and beach-club memberships, which can cost as much as $75,000 apiece. Bert and Jane Kummel, retirees who put their three-bedroom condo on the market for $2.4 million at Thanksgiving, have thrown in $1,000 worth of opera tickets as a lure. But to no avail, says Mrs. Kummel: "It's a great marketing idea, but people just aren't buying like they were."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH THE KEY SPRING selling season about to get under way, the inventory of homes on the market is climbing sharply in a number of major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the latest sign that the balance of power between buyers and sellers is shifting as the once red-hot housing market continues to cool. The slowdown is affecting both existing homes and new homes. Yesterday, the nation's largest builder of luxury homes, Toll Brothers Inc., reported a 29% decline in new orders in its first quarter, which ended Jan. 31. That was below many analysts' expectations and prompted a sharp selloff in Toll Brothers stock. And Ryland Group Inc., a Calabasas, Calif., builder that sells homes in a wide range of prices, recently announced that new orders declined 4.7% for its quarter ended Dec. 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, there were 2.8 million existing houses and condominiums on the market at year end, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is down slightly from November's 2.9 million listings, but up 26% from a year earlier. Adjusted for seasonal variations, inventories have climbed 38% since April, according to Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Economist Jan Hatzius, the largest eight-month increase on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing climate is particularly noticeable in once-hot markets such as Miami, Phoenix and Washington, D.C., and in areas such as Detroit, where price increases have been modest but the job market is weak. Some brokers report that traffic has increased in recent weeks. But with plenty of properties to choose from, buyers have become more selective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in inventories has been good news for people like Mike Perillo, an accountant who has been looking for a home in the Philadelphia suburbs for well over a year. "We're now seeing a lot more properties that appeal to us," says Mr. Perillo. "There's more on the market, and there seems to be a lot less people looking now as opposed to this time last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, where inventories have climbed steadily since last spring, open houses are attracting a steady stream of lookers, says Charles McLean, broker-owner of Century 21 Metro Alliance. "But people are taking their time," he says. "They're not just jumping and writing a contract." Mr. McLean says that if a listing doesn't attract enough traffic, within 30 days they will consider lowering the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Detroit, sales fell nearly 10% in the fourth quarter and inventories climbed amid uncertainty about auto-industry layoffs. To stimulate demand, Real Estate One, a Detroit brokerage firm, has been running a companywide "Bonu$ Homes" promotion in which sellers agree to provide $2,000 to $10,000 toward buyer closing costs on purchases made before April 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The creativity to sell homes is coming back," says Dan Elsea, president of brokerage services at Real Estate One. "We haven't needed it for years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate experts are watching the inventory numbers closely for signs of whether the housing market is poised for a soft landing -- or something worse. When inventories are tight, buyers competing for scarce properties bid up prices. As the supply of homes on the market increases, price increases slow and buyers gain negotiating power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise in inventories follows a prolonged housing boom during which strong demand and low mortgage rates triggered bidding wars and fueled double-digit price gains in many markets. But those days appear to be over. The National Association of Realtors said that it expects sales of existing homes to fall by 4.7% this year to 6.74 million and median home prices to rise an average of 5%, down from 12.7% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts are more pessimistic. In a joint forecast issued last month, housing analytics firm Fiserv CSW, a unit of Fiserv Inc., and economic forecaster Moody's Economy.com, a unit of Moody's Corp., called for home prices to increase by an average of 1.5% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the number of listings rising and the pace of sales slowing, there is now a 5.1-month supply of existing homes on the market, based on the current rate of sales, according to the National Association of Realtors, compared with a record low of 3.8 months in January 2005. Historically, a 5.5-to-six-month supply has been considered a balanced market, says NAR Chief Economist David Lereah. But with the Internet making shopping for a home easier, he says, it is no longer clear just what a balanced market is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another uncertainty: how much of the increase in inventories is due to speculators looking to sell, and whether they will be more willing to cut prices as the market cools. Investors accounted for 9.5% of mortgages to buy homes through October, but their share of purchases peaked during the first half of the year, according to LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp. Brokers in markets such as Phoenix and South Florida say they've seen an increase in investor-owned properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rise in inventories isn't universal. In Seattle, inventories have declined modestly over the past 12 months as a robust job market sustains demand. The supply is so tight, "I don't know if it can get any lower," says Michael Skahen, owner of Lake &amp;Co., a Seattle brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dallas, inventory has edged up slightly, but the pace of sales is up. "The buzz around my office is that everybody is busy now," says Steve Hendry of Re/Max Associates of Dallas. "Our economy seems to be picking up considerably. It's just night and day compared to what was going on this time last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pinch is being felt in many corners of the housing market. The number of completed new homes currently on the market has risen nearly 40% over the past year, according to Hanley Wood Market Intelligence in Costa Mesa, Calif., a market research and consulting firm. The shift has been particularly noticeable where inventories had been thin: In central California, the inventory of new homes climbed to 238 in the fourth quarter, from just 26 a year earlier, an increase of more than 800%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As orders slow, builders are engaged in heavy discounting and promotional activity, particularly among homes for the second-time, move-up and luxury buyer. A survey conducted last month by the National Association of Home Builders found that 64% of builders are now using incentives such as offers to pay closing costs and free upgrades; 19% are cutting prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week Standard Pacific Corp., a major builder, said that new orders, excluding acquisitions, fell about 20% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. Lennar Corp., another builder, recently offered discounts of $20,000 to $30,000, plus help with closing costs and bonuses to brokers, on selected homes in the Tampa area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Toll, Toll Brothers' chairman and chief executive, indicated that slowing orders appeared to reflect three trends. First of all, speculators, who buy homes as investments hoping to flip them later at a hefty profit, are getting out of the market and canceling contracts. Toll said it also is constrained by long delivery times in many communities. During the first quarter, delivery times have increased to 11 months or more -- before the maximum was 11 months. Buyers are reluctant to commit to such a long delivery time when the future of the market is uncertain. Toll also has a big exposure to Washington, D.C., New Jersey, Phoenix and California -- markets that appear to slowing more rapidly than some others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of unoccupied condominiums is also climbing in many areas. In New York's Westchester County, the number of condos on the market jumped to 617 at the end of 2005 from 397 a year earlier. In the Boston area, the number of condos listed at the end of January was 5,114, up from 2,876 a year earlier. In the Washington, D.C., metro area, new-home inventory climbed by more than 900% to 2, 413 in the fourth quarter over the same period a year earlier, largely because of the completion of several condo projects, according to Hanley Wood.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on new construction in the U.S. rose smartly in December, but an index of future housing demand fell, and mortgage applications declined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department reported that total construction spending rose 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.161 trillion. Spending increased 0.5% in November, revised upward from a prior estimate of a 0.2% gain. For 2005 as a whole, U.S. construction spending came to a record $1.12 trillion, an 8.9% increase from 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction spending increased 1% to $655.6 billion. Residential spending was unchanged in November; it was originally estimated as down 0.1%. Nonresidential construction spending increased 1.3% in December. Outlays for schools rose, while highway construction fell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction spending increased 1.1% last month to $904.3 billion, compared with November's 0.3% rise. Public, or government, construction spending increased 0.7% to $256.3 billion, following a 1.2% gain in November. Federal-government construction outlays swelled 6.7% last month. State and local spending -- much larger than federal spending in dollars -- rose a slimmer 0.2% to $236.8 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the uptick in spending, an index of pending home sales -- or homes under contract for sale -- fell for the fourth consecutive month in December. The National Association of Realtors said yesterday its index for pending sales of existing homes fell 3% to 116.4 from 120 during November. The index is down 5.5% from a year earlier and is down from a record 129.2 reading set in August. A sale is listed as pending when the contract has been signed and the transaction hasn't closed, but the sale usually is finalized within one or two months of signing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the group, said he expects the U.S. housing market to stay below the past year's record sales pace. "We're going through a period of adjustment," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the report showed the index of pending home sales rose 2.3% in the South, ticked up 1.5% in the Northeast, fell 8.1% in the West and dropped 9.3% in the Midwest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also yesterday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for new U.S. home loans fell last week by 5.1%, as purchase applications tumbled 8%, and refinancing applications slid 1.5%. Mortgage rates rose, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbing to 6.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity grew for the 51st consecutive month, coming in at 54.8.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo Conversions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Propel the Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Tucson area's rising population closes in on the one-million mark, investors have been snapping up apartment complexes, betting on rising demand for condominiums that offer a slice of the mountainous Sunbelt region's warm winters and laid-back lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy of the visually dramatic Sonoran Desert region of Arizona has been ramping up since 2003, after it suffered job losses following the tech bust and sagging tourism following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The burst of activity in the apartment sector comes as employment levels rose to a 10-year high in December after increasing at a year-to-year rate of 3.7% for the month, more than double the national rate of 1.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job growth, an above-average influx of new residents and relatively little new construction strengthened the commercial real-estate market last year. By year end, the office sector's vacancy rate had recovered to 2000 levels. Retail vacancies fell below the 2000 level, while the industrial market's improvement lagged behind, and average asking rents rose in December from a year earlier in all but the retail sector, according to Don Ahee Jr. of CB Richard Ellis Tucson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just over 100 miles southeast of Phoenix and a short drive north of the Mexican border, the area is known for the posh spas that dot the landscape. It is also home to defense contractor Raytheon Co.'s missile systems division, the University of Arizona, a strong optics industry, as well as many smaller service companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has posted the region's most impressive growth in recent years, though the pace showed signs of slowing by the end of 2005, according to the Tucson Association of Realtors. Median home prices climbed 66% from 2002 to $242,300 in the third quarter, just above the national level -- but they are still a deal compared with the Western region's median of $322,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The froth carried over to the apartment market last year. Aiming to offer ownership options that are more affordable than single-family homes, developers have turned to condominium conversions in Tucson as property prices in many larger cities soared out of reach, said Mike McClain, senior investment associate with real-estate investment brokerage firm Marcus &amp;Millichap in Tucson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar volume of apartment-complex sales far outstripped all other Tucson-area commercial-property transactions last year, with nearly a half-billion dollars of apartments trading hands, more than double the year-earlier level, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers such as Terry Brown, president of Brown Cos. in San Francisco, which began purchasing Tucson apartment units last year and expects to own about 1,600 after closings within the next few months, are confident the condos will be in demand, in part because retiring baby boomers are expected to flock to the region. The metro area's population increased at an average annual rate of 1.7% over the past five years to an estimated 972,297 in January, and is expected to hit one million sometime in 2007. The population is forecast to rise at twice the national pace through 2010, according to Economy.com, a unit of Moody's Corp., and David Taylor, a Tucson city planner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the jury is still out on the condo-conversion market. "Condominiums have never been popular here because most people who move to Tucson like wide-open spaces," said Marshall Vest, director of the Economic and Business Research Center at University of Arizona's Eller College of Management in Tucson. And thousands of converted units could go up for sale this year, up from about 450 units sold last year, said Mr. McClain of Marcus &amp;Millichap.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>1158 words</div><div>28 January 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth slowed to its most sluggish pace in three years at the end of last year as consumers and businesses applied the brakes to spending. While a rebound is likely in the current quarter, the expansion after two brisk years appears to be moderating as higher energy prices and interest rates begin to bite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's gross domestic product, or total output of goods and services, grew at just a 1.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. That's the slowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2002 and well below the average 4.1% growth of the prior 10 quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a slight tone change in the economy, though nowhere nearly as dramatic as the headline suggests," said Nancy Lazar, economist at ISI Group, a New York research and brokerage firm. "Growth may be moving into a slower stage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The principal cause was a slowdown in growth of consumer spending to a four-year low of 1.1%. Other sectors softened, too. Business investment grew just 2.8%, less than a third of the prevailing rate in the prior 2 1/2 years. Residential housing construction grew 3.5%, the slowest pace in a year. And the trade deficit widened sharply, damping domestic production. Federal defense spending dropped, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists pointed to four factors in the slowdown that are likely to reverse in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade deficit widened in part because Hurricane Katrina idled a lot of Gulf of Mexico energy production, forcing the U.S. to rely more on imports. Gulf production is slowly recovering. Ms. Lazar said the trade deficit probably won't widen as much in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending growth slowed during the quarter mostly because of weak automobile sales. But Citigroup economist Steve Wieting noted that auto sales have since leveled off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several months ago, A.G. Lafley, chief executive at Procter &amp;Gamble Co., said the big consumer-products maker was "nervous as cats" about consumers in the wake of two hurricanes and higher energy prices, and was closely tracking the frequency of consumer shopping trips and the amount spent. But on Friday, as P&amp;G reported a 29% jump in quarterly profit, he told analysts that he is now less worried. "We are with the consumer every day," he said. "So far, so good."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal defense outlays fell because of the late signing of the defense appropriations bill, and Pentagon spending will likely rebound, Mr. Wieting, the Citigroup economist, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lastly, business investment was held back by a drop in transportation-equipment purchases. David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch, said shipment data from Boeing Co. suggest capital spending ought to look stronger in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all these reasons, economists said growth will probably recover in the first quarter. Indeed, initial claims for unemployment insurance have been trending lower, leading some analysts to predict that job growth will top a hefty 250,000 in January. The government releases its estimate of January job growth on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the U.S. may be settling into a period of growth that is slower than in the past couple of years -- not unusual for an economy four years into an expansion. To absorb last year's jump in natural gas and gasoline prices, consumers may have to restrain other spending. The Federal Reserve's steady increases in short-term interest rates may finally be having an effect on borrowing and spending. Auto makers are more reluctant to offer cut-rate financing. And while long-term mortgage rates haven't risen in the past two years, increasingly popular adjustable-rate mortgages, tied to short-term rates, have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks rose sharply Friday as several bullish profit reports outweighed the weaker than expected GDP report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 97.74 points to 10907.21. Bonds were little changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The GDP report also found that inflation crept up. The price index of consumer expenditures, excluding food and energy, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, advanced at a 2.2% annual rate, up from 1.4% in the third quarter, putting it around the top of incoming Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's comfort zone of 1% to 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is expected to raise its target for short-term interest rate to 4.5% on Tuesday from 4.25%. Markets and economists are divided on whether it will raise the rate again on March 28 to 4.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed might pause after the January meeting to assess whether the fourth-quarter weakness is the beginning of a more protracted slowdown and if the rise in inflation is more than temporary," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, an economic analysis firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also said Friday that sales of new homes rose 2.9% in December from November, to an annual rate of 1.27 million, failing to recoup November's 9.2% drop. The inventory of unsold homes stood at 516,000, or 4.9 months' supply. That ratio is unchanged from November and still the highest since 1996. The median sale price, at $221,800, was down 3% from a year earlier. However, Michael Carliner, economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said changes in the way data are collected have understated price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carliner predicted that home sales will drop 6% this year, and residential construction, a big engine of growth for several years, will become a drag. But he said that unless mortgage rates jump sharply, a severe downturn is unlikely. He said that while the number of new homes for sale has risen, the share that haven't yet been built has grown, to 21% of total housing inventory in December from 16% a year earlier. That reduces the potential impact on construction of a fall in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenberg said the impact of a housing slowdown will spread beyond just home building and real-estate commissions as consumers, who have been borrowing against the rising home values, spend less and save more. "The principal reason the saving rate is negative is all the borrowing that took place against an ever-rising home price, and that's coming to an end," he said. That will be partly offset by healthy growth in business-equipment spending and exports, he predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers did spend more than they earned in the fourth quarter, producing a negative saving rate for the third consecutive quarter and a negative rate for the year as a whole for the first time since 1947, when records of such data began. But the rate improved in the fourth quarter to minus 0.4%, from minus 1.8% in the third quarter.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs </div><div>530 words</div><div>26 January 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in December to their lowest level in three months, but they still set a record for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said nationwide sales of previously owned homes fell 5.7% to an annual rate of 6.60 million last month from November's revised annual rate of 7.0 million. Analysts had projected a 6.87 million sales rate in the existing-home market, which includes single-family residences, condominiums, townhomes and co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median price for existing homes of all types in December was $211,000, down from an unrevised $215,000 in November, but up 10.5% from December 2004. The inventory of homes on the market increased slightly to a 5.1 months' supply last month, compared with 5.0 months in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern was mixed regionally, with sales falling 11.4% in the West, 7.2% in the South, and 2.6% in the Midwest. Sales in the Northeast were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight in Waltham, Mass., said in a statement that the movement of interest rates is cooling the housing market and will continue to do so in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Interest rates have eased in recent weeks, but we are expecting them to drift back up over the first half of 2006," he said, adding that if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates two more times before pausing, the increases "will cool off the housing market and deflate many local housing bubbles."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newport doesn't expect the market to collapse anytime soon. The first casualties might come in places like the condo market, where the inventory of unsold homes jumped 8% last month. Sales of existing condominiums and co-ops increased a modest 1.6% in December, according to the NAR report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial institutions have been keeping a watchful eye on the condo market and in some cases have scaled back lending for new condo developments. "We see risk of a substantial condo-price decline in certain frothy markets, based on record high inventory levels and the recent rapid price appreciation in condos," said Banc of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the apparent slowing, existing-home sales for the year reached 7.072 million units, setting their fifth successive annual record, the NAR said. Home prices still remain strong, despite some softening. Given these factors, NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said in a statement that there is a "soft landing in sight for the housing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The level of home-sales activity is now at a sustainable level, and is likely to pick up a bit in the months ahead," Mr. Lereah said, adding that he expects the 2006 housing market to "remain historically high but lower" than 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent boost in mortgage applications might suggest a "partial rebound in sales is directly ahead," Banc of America Securities economist Gary Bigg said. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.27% last month, down from November's 6.33%. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough Angles to View Homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' report on existing-home sales is one of the best monthly reads on the housing market out there. But at a time when investor anxiety about real estate is running high, these numbers leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little doubt that today's report will show that sales of existing (read: used) homes fell in December. In addition to anecdotal reports that housing continued to deteriorate during the month, pending home sales -- that is, sales where a contract has been signed, but that haven't closed yet -- were falling in the months leading up to December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC estimate that today's report will show that sales of existing homes fell by 1.4% in December from November's level. That would put sales at an annualized 6.9 million or so, below last June's peak level of 7.35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is becoming a front-burner issue for Wall Street. First of all, investors fret that because prices ran up by so much over the past several years, the real-estate market could be in for more than a garden-variety slowdown. Second, they worry that because housing's strength has provided a big boost to consumer spending, even a garden-variety slowdown could prompt big-time belt-tightening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But getting a good sense of what is going on in the U.S. housing market is difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, it isn't a market, per se, but a bunch of regional markets. A big dropoff in a hot market, such as Northern California, might not register on the national sales figures, but because so much money is tied up there, it could really matter for the economy. Or not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly numbers are also incredibly lumpy: Far more houses are sold in the summer than in the winter, so the National Association of Realtors adjusts its sales figures -- trimming the summer sales numbers and pumping up the winter number -- to try to adjust for those lumps and better reflect the overall trend. As a result, little changes in the actual sales numbers in the winter can make for big changes in the adjusted numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises the prospects for some existing-sales reports that are both eye-popping, and best ignored.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs and Kemba Dunham </div><div>786 words</div><div>20 January 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a housing slowdown intensified as home construction fell sharply last month, and a deep-discount deal offered by a major home builder in one of its pricier markets suggested the industry may be feeling some anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, two other big home builders, D.R. Horton Inc. and Beazer Homes USA Inc., reported solid quarterly earnings growth, but analysts said Horton looks better positioned to cope with a downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that U.S. housing starts fell 8.9% in December to an annual rate of 1.933 million units from November's 2.121 million units. The drop may have been at least partly weather-related. However, applications for building permits also fell, declining 4.4% to 2.068 million units from 2.163 million in November. Building permits, which don't fluctuate with the weather, are considered a dependable indicator of future construction activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's decline in home construction was led by a 12.3% plunge in starts for single-family homes, which fell to an annual rate of 1.577 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we have been talking about for some time, the market is slowing," said Nicolas Retsinas, director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. "Slowing is not the same as reversing course," he added, "It's still a pretty big number."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, even with the weakness seen in yesterday's report, 2005 was a record year for home construction. The Commerce Department said single-family home-and-apartment construction totaled 2.065 million units, a 5.6% increase from 2004. That pushed total construction to the second-highest level on record, topped only by the 2.357 million units built in 1972.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the signs of a slowdown, D.R. Horton and Beazer Homes both reported a 29% increase in earnings for their fiscal first quarters ended Dec. 31. Horton's net income rose to $310.1 million, or 98 cents share, from $241 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $2.9 billion as the company closed on 9,891 homes, a slight increase from 9,680 homes a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it previously reported, Horton's orders for new homes during the quarter rose 19% to $3.2 billion, representing 11,463 homes. Orders serve as a barometer for future earnings as they reflect revenue the company will receive two or three quarters down the line when a home sale closes. Other builders, such as Denver-based M.D.C. Holdings Inc., have recently reported declining orders, but Horton, Fort Worth, Texas, bucked the trend by showing growth in all of its regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta's Beazer Homes indicated that it is starting to see softness in some regions. The company said its quarterly net income rose to $89.9 million, or $2 a share, from $69.7 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 21% to $1.1 billion. Beazer's new orders rose 9.2% to 3,872 homes during the quarter. That reflects increases in the Southeast, Central and Midwest regions, which were partly offset by lower home orders in the West and Mid-Atlantic regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts think some builders will weather the slowdown better than others. "Horton is just better positioned in all of the markets that they're in in terms of the price points that they serve," said Alex Barron, an analyst at JMP Securities in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the building industry's confidence has trended downward for the past few months, recent declines in mortgage rates and improved consumer sentiment have moderated initial fears, according to a recent report by the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders appear anxious, however. On the Web site 12hoursalebycentex.com, Centex Corp., a builder based in Dallas, is offering buyers who show up between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m Saturday at almost any new Centex neighborhood in northern California as much as $100,000 off the price of selected home sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to 271,000 in the week ended Jan. 14, down 36,000 from the previous week and the lowest level in six years. The four-week moving average of new claims dropped 12,000 to 299,000 from the previous week's 311,000, the lowest level since October 2000.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Danielle Reed Dow Jones Newswires </div><div>630 words</div><div>19 January 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, home buyers in some markets across the country have been able to do something they hadn't for years: haggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the galloping housing market shows signs of slowing, certain areas of the country -- such as Boston's North Shore suburbs, the Washington, D.C. metro area, and parts of Arizona and Colorado -- are beginning to favor buyers who can negotiate a better price, or at least a few more perks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's most definitely a buyer's market," says Lanse Robb, a real-estate agent with LandVest who specializes in the upper-end market on Boston's North Shore. There is "more inventory than buyers," he says. "Buyers dictate the terms, the price, and in more cases than not make very few offers. If they don't get a quick and decisive response, they move on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, there have been some consistent signs that home-price appreciation and the pace of home sales are cooling. The National Association of Realtors reported in early January that its pending-home-sales index, based on contracts signed in November, fell 2.5% both from the previous month as well as from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the third consecutive decline for the index. Existing-home sales for November fell, too, down 1.7% from the prior month. And November new-home sales declined 11.3% from October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Denver-based home builder MDC Holdings Inc. posted a 38% increase in its earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005, according to a report released Tuesday, the company's new-home orders dropped 10% in the quarter over the same quarter in 2004. Orders reflect revenue the company will receive in future quarters when home sales close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharpest drop in orders was in the Washington, D.C., area, where they fell 60% -- because of a higher number of home-order cancellations and a smaller inventory -- and in Arizona, where orders declined 39%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MDC noted that "the substantial rates of home price increases experienced in Arizona and Virginia over the past two years have moderated to more normalized levels." What that has translated into for buyers in those markets is a bit more bang for their buck, in the form of additional incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did offer a little bit more in the way of incentives," compared with a year earlier in those markets, says MDC's chief financial officer, Gary Reece. He notes that the incentives, which typically take the form of options and upgrades available from design centers -- perhaps upgrading the countertops to granite from some less-expensive material -- were "nothing dramatic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year earlier in Arizona, incentives may have equaled 2.5% of a home sale price, Mr. Reece says. In the fourth quarter of 2005 "they might be a percentage point higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another market in which incentives were up a bit in the fourth quarter over prior years was Colorado, Mr. Reece says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around Denver, "there's a lot of new home building, some on good land, and some on not-so-good land," says Lou Barnes, a partner at Boulder West Financial Services, a mortgage-banking company in Boulder, Colo. To the east and north of Denver, in Weld County, "builders are delivering houses at the same prices they were two and three years ago, with incentives in the $20,000 range on $300,000 houses," Mr. Barnes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by and large, prices have held firm. After the big run-up of the past few years, "we were able to glide to a stop," Mr. Barnes says. "It's about as happy a post-bubble experience as you could expect." </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Builders Brace for a `Simmering Down' of Sales as Few Fear a Serious Decline</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jim Carlton </div><div>990 words</div><div>16 January 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orlando, Fla. -- ON THE SURFACE, business appeared to be better than ever at last week's annual International Builders Show. A record 1,600 exhibitors touted everything from Mr. Steam towel warmers to Synlawn synthetic grass to 10-foot-high Marvin double-hung windows. Attendance also was a record. Just over 105,000 people crowded into this city's Orange County Convention Center. That was up sharply from the 66,000 who attended the show 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But below the surface, there was an air of caution, which stemmed from an industry slowdown that began in the fourth quarter and uncertainty over what it will mean for home construction, as well as the overall economy. Hundreds of builders packed into an auditorium to hear three industry economists predict the first downturn in U.S. housing starts in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders of the National Association of Home Builders predicted housing starts would fall by between 6% and 7% from last year's torrid pace of about 2.1 million units -- amid high home prices and rising mortgage rates. Although Mr. Seiders, the association's chief economist, characterized the projected drop as only a "simmering down" of the white-hot housing market, his forecast included what he called the remote possibility of "sizable house-price declines" if the investors and short-term-interest borrowers who have helped fuel the boom start rushing for the exits. "The real question," he told the audience, "is where do we go from here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One pessimist, Ed Sullivan, chief economist of the Portland Cement Association, suggested a recession-like housing spiral isn't so far-fetched. He pointed out that the disparity between incomes and home prices is at its greatest level in at least a quarter century, and that the upward trend in rates could make it harder for adjustable-rate borrowers to keep up on their payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUT FEW OTHERS in the industry look for a serious decline in housing activity anytime soon, given that mortgage rates remain low by historical standards and demographic trends are still favorable. Rather, the prevailing feeling in Orlando was that 2006 will remain healthy for housing, but that builders and suppliers will have to tighten their belts a notch or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: as home sales downshift, builders will find it difficult to raise prices, even though their own costs will continue to grow. Officials of Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. said they expect gross profit margins to decline some in the current fiscal year from 26.4% in the year ended in October. That is chiefly because the Red Bank, N.J., builder won't be able to continue passing along high land-buying costs to buyers, said Larry Sorsby, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Mr. Sorsby added Hovnanian still expects revenue to increase in the low 20% range this year from $5.35 billion in fiscal 2005, which was up 29% from 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big builder, WCI Communities Inc., said it has seen price increases erode at its properties in Virginia and Maryland. After raising new-home prices there 15% to 20% in the first half of 2005, WCI officials say they haven't been able to put through much more of an increase since, and that they expect no more than 5% appreciation there this year. However, WCI, based in Bonita Springs, Fla., says it doesn't expect margins to narrow this year, in part because of back orders in its main Florida markets. The question is, what happens in 2007?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a different story on the cost side. Labor costs are rising amid falling unemployment. Labor, along with land acquisition, accounts for the biggest cost of building a home. Amid a scarcity of labor in some fast-growing markets like Florida, construction workers' pay and benefits in September were up 3.5% from a year earlier, compared with an average of 3.1% for all workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Construction workers are likely to remain in heavy demand this year, with many dividing their energy between building subdivisions and helping to clear rubble in the Hurricane Katrina zone. "The labor shortages are serious, but they are less serious for the big builders," says Jerry Starkey, president and chief executive of WCI.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MEANWHILE, EXTERNAL factors could drive further price increases in building materials like gypsum and cement. Those materials are in strong demand by builders in both the commercial and government sector, which has started coming on strong the past year after a malaise that began in 2001. Officials of Georgia-Pacific, a unit of Koch Industries Inc., said there is no let-up in demand for their gypsum products, even after they imposed four price increases last year totaling about 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insulation makers like Johns Manville, a Berkshire Hathaway Inc. company, and Owens Corning say they are seeing more demand from people retrofitting their homes to help reduce high energy costs, and thus don't expect any drop-off in sales. National Association of Home Builders's economists predict overall building materials and components prices will increase 5% to 6% this year, down slightly from last year's 6.1% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other suppliers don't have any cushion. Timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co., for instance, sells its building products mainly into the housing market, and officials there say builders may lean on them for price breaks. Still, Weyerhaeuser officials said an industry slowdown wouldn't be all bad. Last year, they said, the Federal Way, Wash., company had to turn away business, and sometimes couldn't meet delivery schedules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the challenges, most builders remain upbeat. "The mood is generally optimistic," says Samuel Cypert, executive director of the Public Home Builders Council of America. "But they tend to be optimistic anyway." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported a further decline in its monthly index of pending home sales, the latest sign of a cooling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signals remained positive for the broader economy, however, with new claims for unemployment benefits falling to their lowest level in five years and the service sector continuing to show growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending-sales index, based on signed contracts for houses, fell 2.5% to 120.6 in November from October, its third consecutive monthly decrease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gradual rise in interest rates over the past few months has made homes less affordable, and inventories of unsold homes have been building up. An index of applications for home-purchase mortgages, compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association, has declined 21% since hitting a peak in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a five-year period in which home prices more than doubled in many American cities, recent data suggest that the market peaked in mid-2005, said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland. He said he sees signs of oversupply in new homes but believes the housing market overall will have a soft landing, with average price increases slowing to perhaps 3% or 4% this year from the double-digit rates of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at New York consulting firm MFR Inc., also expects the market to slow gradually, rather than crash. But Mr. Shapiro said he wouldn't be surprised to see prices decline in some East and West Coast cities where the housing market has been hottest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, initial claims for jobless benefits fell to their lowest level since September 2000, dropping 35,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 291,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average fell 9,250 to 316,750. While some analysts said the latest figures point to a sustained improvement in the labor market, others said they may reflect only the temporary influence of the holiday season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In short, [the reading] looks great, but don't read too much into it," Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a written statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, which represents corporate purchasing managers, reported that its index of nonmanufacturing business activity rose to 59.8 last month from 58.5 in November. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The index's rise was fueled by growth in new orders, new export orders and a plunge in prices paid for materials. Employment activity, however, was little changed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A leading indicator of U.S. housing demand fell for a third straight month in November, an industry group said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index for pending sales of existing homes declined 2.5% to 120.6 from October's 123.7. It marked the third drop in a row from a record 129.2 set in August. The index was 2.5% below the level of November 2004, NAR said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, said the index remains well above a mark considered historically strong. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of contract activity during 2001, the first year examined and the first of five consecutive record years for existing-home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are clearly experiencing a market transition, moving from a prolonged boom to a more balanced period of sustainable sales," Mr. Lereah said. "Home sales have been peaking for the last five years and we will land on a high plateau in 2006 -- a market that will be healthy for both buyers and sellers."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the index fell 8.3% in the Northeast, 1.9% in the South, and 5.1% in the West. The Midwest saw a 3.4% advance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said the number of first-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to a five-year low. Initial jobless claims decreased by 35,000 to a seasonally adjusted level of 291,000 in the week ended Dec. 31. The four-week moving average of initial jobless claims also fell, down by 9,250 to 316,750 from 326,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, meanwhile, said its index of nonmanufacturing business activity, comprised mainly of service-sector firms, rose to 59.8 in December from 58.5 in November. The index stood at 60 in October. Readings above 50 denote expanding activity, and the higher the number the more broad-based the growth seen.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale prices of condominiums and co-ops in Manhattan continued to rise last year, but there was a sizable decrease in the number of sales, according to reports by two of the city's largest real-estate brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corcoran Group reported the number of sales of Manhattan condos and co-ops dropped by about one-third from 2004 to 2005. Similarly, Prudential Douglas Elliman said sales slipped 27.2% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing in Manhattan is unique because of the large number of wealthy buyers and barriers to new development -- especially the lack of available land -- the city is watched for possible trends that could emerge in other U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you are seeing is a pause, a holdback," says Jonathan Miller, president and chief executive officer of Miller Samuel, a real-estate appraisal firm based in New York that prepared the Prudential Douglas Elliman report. The decrease in the number of sales came as inventory returned to normal levels after being unusually low in recent years, Mr. Miller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, Corcoran's CEO and president, says rising interest rates and downbeat media coverage about the housing market have made buyers more patient and less eager to snap up something immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The falloff in volume came as buyers took a pause and said, `We've got a lot more selection and a lot more power,' " Ms. Liebman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, Big Apple property prices remain sky high. Corcoran reported that the average sale price of a Manhattan apartment was about $1.2 million in 2005, a 28% jump from 2004. Other brokers, however, have been seeing more-modest price increases. Halstead Property said the average price of a Manhattan apartment in the fourth quarter of 2005 rose 4% from a year earlier to $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a city with an abundance of multimillion-dollar flats, a New York broker's tally of average prices can be skewed by sales of large luxury apartments and the appreciation of prices across the market, especially at the beginning of last year. Average sale prices rose last year, driven partly by sales of ultraluxury properties. Ms. Liebman says the very-high-end sales, of more than $10 million, are booming. "People with extreme wealth are buying trophy properties," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices continue to move up, in some cases condos and co-ops are staying on the market longer. According to Prudential Douglas Elliman, it took an average of 137 days to sell an apartment in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with an average of 96 days a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now there is competition [from other sellers], and you might have to come down in price," says Dorothy Herman, Prudential Douglas Elliman's CEO and president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, toward the end of last year Corcoran began seeing a decrease in average housing prices. Average sale prices of condos and co-ops in the fourth quarter decreased by 7% from the third quarter to $1.1 million. Sales activity in the fourth quarter was also slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, of Miller Samuel, says the beginning of 2006 could see more sales activity. One reason is that many New Yorkers who work in the financial sector typically use their year-end bonuses to buy real estate. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>1216 words</div><div>4 January 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are less worried about inflation and thus may raise interest rates just one or two more times in the next few months, minutes of their December meeting suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The number of additional [rate increases] required probably would not be large," according to a summary of the Dec. 13 meeting, released yesterday, with the customary three-week lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More clearly than the statement issued just after the meeting, the minutes signal that the Fed is nearing the end of a campaign that has raised the target for the federal-funds rate -- charged on overnight loans between banks -- to 4.25% from a 46-year low of 1% in June 2004, in 13 quarter-percentage-point steps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The likelihood that the Fed is nearing an end to its tightening was reinforced yesterday by weaker-than-expected economic data. An index of manufacturing activity, based on a survey of factory purchasing managers, slipped in December, and construction spending grew less than expected in November as home-renovation outlays fell. In addition, some economists estimate that consumer spending was flat in the fourth quarter for the first time since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of an end to rate increases sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 129.91 points, or 1.21%, to 10847.41, its biggest point and percentage gain since late October. Bonds finished mixed, with the yield declining on two-year Treasurys, which are sensitive to expectations on Fed policy. The dollar lost ground, meanwhile, posting its biggest decline against the euro in three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes said Fed officials' inflation concerns had "eased somewhat" since the previous meeting Nov. 1. They noted that slowing housing-price gains would restrain consumer spending, and that officials had to be "mindful of the lags in the effect" of past rate increases on the economy. These factors all weigh in favor of the Fed halting its policy-tightening soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some factors are pushing in the other direction. The minutes cite concerns that higher energy prices could yet push underlying inflation higher, that business spending had accelerated, and that the "sustained period" of low interest rates may have boosted home prices and raised the risk of an overheating economy. "Views differed on how much further" rates might have to rise, the minutes cautioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given these conflicting forces, Fed officials may further weaken their verbal commitment to future rate actions in the statement issued after their meeting Jan. 31, the last to be led by Chairman Alan Greenspan. Some Fed officials think that would give the incoming chairman, Ben Bernanke, more freedom to plot the policy he thinks best -- whether to stop raising rates immediately or to continue raising them at his first Fed meeting on March 28.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 13, the Fed altered two key parts of its post-meeting statement. It abandoned the assertion that interest rates were "accommodative," or below a level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. And instead of saying rates would continue to rise at "a pace that is likely to be measured," it said instead, "some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at the time generally saw the retention of the word "measured" as a reaffirmation of plans to keep raising rates at a quarter point per meeting. But Fed officials, according to the meeting minutes and in sentiments expressed since, actually meant to convey less certainty about further rate increases. They retained the word "measured" to prevent speculation that a half-percentage-point increase might be in the cards, and eliminated the word "pace" because they thought the word might imply two or more rate increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's minutes and weaker economic data prompted some economists to reconsider their rate views. Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, still expects the federal-funds rate to rise to 5% by spring, but he said the minutes put that forecast "at risk." Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, is also sticking to a forecast of 5% by mid-2006. But, Mr. Hatzius said the weak manufacturing report as well as Fed officials' apparent lack of worry about inflation "have increased the downside risk to our forecast a bit. It certainly could be 4.75%, although stopping at 4.5% would still require a significantly weaker set of numbers than we are expecting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In financial futures markets, expectations of Fed actions have changed very little since early December. Contracts based on the federal-funds rate reflect expectations that it will rise to 4.5% on Jan. 31 and put about 50% odds on a move to 4.75% on March 28, with no increases deemed likely thereafter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials probably will tweak their post-meeting statement again on Jan. 31. Since most officials agree inflation is more likely to rise than fall and the inflation rate is near the high end of their "comfort zone," they may still want to signal a bias to tighter credit conditions. But because their actions will depend more on new economic data than in the past year and half, they may soften the commitment to raise rates further. For example, instead of saying further increases are "likely to be needed," the statement could say "may be needed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a group representing corporate purchasing managers, said yesterday that its index of manufacturing activity dropped to 54.2 in December from 58.1 in November and 59.1 in October. Readings above 50 indicate the manufacturing sector is expanding, and all parts of the index continue to exceed their 20-year averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, "the pace of growth has decelerated," Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said. "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita disrupted transportation networks and supply chains in manufacturing at a time when inventories were already lean, setting off a scramble for materials in September, October and into November. By year end, manufacturers got caught up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM's new-orders index, a gauge of future manufacturing activity, fell to 55.5 in December, down from 59.8 in November, and the production index, which measures output, slipped to 57 from 60.6 in November. New orders from other countries, as measured by ISM's export index, slid to 53.3 last month, down from 59.2 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers, however, got some relief from elevated prices for raw materials, including energy. The prices index fell to 63 from 74 in November and 84 in October. Still, manufacturers remain wary about energy prices, said Norbert Ore, Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s procurement director, who oversees the ISM survey. Several managers, he said, indicated they plan to buy energy-saving equipment and materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said construction spending grew 0.2% in November to a seasonally adjusted $1.146 trillion annual rate after rising 0.8% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction grew 0.2%, fueled primarily by 0.5% increase in non-residential construction while residential construction slipped 0.1%. Government construction increased 0.3%, led by increases in educational and highway spending.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>774 words</div><div>30 December 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to surge last month even as sales slowed. But economists say the trend can't last, and prices probably will fall in the months ahead as inventories of unsold homes -- especially condominiums -- continue to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that previously owned, or existing, homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.97 million in November, down 1.7% from the previous month and off 0.1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though home sales remain strong by historical standards, the November drop was the second consecutive monthly decline and provided the latest evidence that the housing market is "running out of a little steam," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. He said high home prices and rising mortgage rates are responsible for the slowing, but added that the market is cooling in an orderly fashion and isn't collapsing. "Air is coming out of the housing balloon rather than a balloon popping."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling demand often translates into lower prices. But last month, home prices continued to surge. The median price for an existing home was $215,000, up 13% from a year earlier. In some parts of the country, the disconnect between prices and sales was even wider. In the West, for example, home prices jumped 19% from a year earlier to a median price of $328,000 even though sales were off 3.7% both from the previous month and a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah said that prices remained high nationally because sellers in many markets are resistant to lowering their prices, even when advised to do so by real-estate agents. He said it may take several months before prices adjust to the slower sales pace and rising inventory levels. Total housing inventory levels rose 1.2% at the end of November to 2.90 million existing homes available for sale, which represents a five-month supply at the current sales pace. That's up from a 3.8-month supply in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of that inventory buildup was in the condominium market, which appears to be weakening at a faster pace than the overall housing market. Condominium inventories rose to a 5.9-month supply last month from a 5.4-month supply in October. Daniel Oppenheim, a Bank of America Corp. housing analyst, termed the condo-inventory level "worrisome" and said the market is exhibiting signs of being "oversupplied."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though condo sales were off just 0.8% last month, (a smaller decline than the overall market) when viewed over a longer time period condo sales are off sharply. Haseeb Ahmed, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase, says that in the three months ending in November, existing condo sales posted a cumulative decline of 9.3% compared with a 3.6% decline in single-family home sales. "That tells us that speculative activity is abating at a rapid pace" in the condo sector, he said. Still, condo prices rose last month to a median of $225,300, up 10.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the cooling that occurred last month, existing home sales are still on track to set a record in 2005, possibly exceeding seven million units, which would top last year's record of 6.78 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said yesterday that the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 322,000 in the week ended Dec. 24, a mild increase in line with expectations. The four-week moving average of initial jobless claims rose by 250 to 325,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also yesterday, the Conference Board, a private research group, said its help-wanted advertising index edged up to 39 in November, compared with a reading of 38 in October and of 36 a year earlier. The Conference Board tracks help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major U.S. newspapers monthly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, yesterday's labor market reports and housing figures depict a healthy economy, said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "The economy is doing fine as we enter 2006," he said. "The labor market seems firm. Housing is moving lower but activity is still being well maintained."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SALES OF EXISTING homes in the U.S. dropped for the second straight month in November, while new claims for jobless benefits rose last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell to a 6.97 million seasonally adjusted annual rate last month, a 1.7% decline from October's unrevised 7.09 million, the National Association of Realtors said. Sales dropped by 2.7% in October.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in November took the biggest one-month tumble in nearly 12 years, and inventories of unsold homes grew in the latest sign that the nation's housing market is slowing from its frenzied pace of the past five years. But industrial conditions continued to improve as orders for big-ticket factory goods accelerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department estimated that newly built single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.245 million in November, down 11% from the revised estimate for October. That was the largest decline since January 1994. The November pace was up 6% from a year earlier, however, indicating that while housing is slowing down, sales remain healthy by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his daily commentary sent to clients, Morgan Stanley economist David Greenlaw said "even if sales were to slow abruptly from here we are not looking at anything like the overbuilt conditions that existed in the early 1990's," when prices fell sharply in some cities. "We continue to believe that housing is cooling, but not collapsing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home prices do appear to be heading lower. Bank of America said its survey of real-estate agents this month showed flat to lower home prices in 15 of 20 major metropolitan markets. Daniel Oppenheim, a housing analyst at Bank of America in New York, said he expects new-home sales to slow further to an annual rate of about 1.1 million units in 2006. He cited higher mortgage rates, more stringent lending standards, reduced demand from investors and the difficulty many people face affording a home after the price surge of recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale at the end of November reached 503,000, up 3.3% from a month earlier, the Commerce Department reported. At the current rate of sales, that inventory represents enough homes to last 4.9 months, up from 4.2 months at the end of October. The median sales price in November was $225,200, down 4.1% from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods -- high priced products expected to last at least three years -- rose 4.4% in November to a seasonally adjusted $223.03 billion, the biggest advance since May. However, most of the boost came from soaring demand for commercial airplanes and parts, which jumped nearly 134%, lifted by strong sales at Boeing Co. Excluding the transportation sector, orders for durable goods decreased 0.6%, the third-straight monthly decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the University of Michigan's full-month report on consumer sentiment rose to a reading of 91.5 in December, up from 88.7 in the preliminary report and 81.6 in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing-bubble debate has served as a full-employment act for economists. It's also left some folks wondering how much they should shell out on remodeling if their as-yet-unfinished hardwood floor is about to drop out from under them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irresolute remodelers can get off their picket fence: Projects that make your house more pleasant usually help sell it -- regardless of where the market is headed -- and a lot of the cost can be recouped if you move. How much depends in part on location, with buyers in some of the hottest housing markets willing to pay a premium for fancy fix-ups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But poorly done, or overly personalized, remodeling works against you at resell: As a conscientious contractor told a couple with a starter home, "You do not want orange tile."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-improvement money should first go toward jobs that make your pad more livable, if not lovable. These improvements may not boost resale value, but good luck selling the house at market value without them: If the pipes sound like whale-song, the pipes come first, because even the most hapless home inspector will bother to flush the toilet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners fixate on and fret about kitchens and baths. As Martha Stewart might say, that's a good thing, because these rooms count for a lot. Don't touch the rest of the house if you're planning a move within a few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a higher return on renovating a kitchen than any other project in the house," says Cory Marks, a Re/Max Realtor in Northern New Jersey. "That can include even a minor kitchen repair. What I've seen people do is keep a lot of existing structures in place."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If every nail you drive is with an eye toward selling, you may as well use the bible the Realtors quote from: Remodeling magazine, whose annual "Cost vs. Value Report" reveals average costs recouped on major kitchen work are above 90 cents on the dollar, and nearly 100% on a minor job. Returns on buff-and-polish work soar to as much as 170% in big cities and drop to as low as about 60% elsewhere.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1431 words</div><div>22 December 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOARING HOUSE PRICES and higher mortgage rates have put homeownership out of reach for more people than at any time in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing affordability in October sank to its lowest levels since 1991, according to the National Association of Realtors' Affordability Index, a widely followed measure of the average household's ability to buy a home at current interest rates. In some areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Miami, housing affordability has dropped to levels not seen since the early to mid-1980s, according to mortgage giant Fannie Mae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability has long been a problem for low-income home buyers. But as home prices have marched steadily higher in recent years, many buyers with healthier incomes also are being squeezed. Declining affordability mainly affects whether first-time home buyers will enter the market, but in some markets people who already own a home are finding it tough to trade up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that the growing costs of homeownership are also beginning to take a toll on the housing market. "There's a systematic erosion of affordability," says David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. That decline is "the main reason . . . the market is starting to cool." Mortgage applications fell to an 11-month low last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported yesterday, as applications to purchase homes declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the drop in affordability, the percentage of households that live in a home they own is at near-record levels. Mortgage rates, though edging higher, are still relatively low by historical standards. And lenders have helped to offset declines in home affordability with creative mortgage products, such as interest-only loans, that allow borrowers to stretch into a more expensive home, while keeping their monthly payments down. But rising short-term interest rates are eroding the effectiveness of many such mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing affordability fell nearly 9% in the third-quarter from the same period a year earlier, according to an analysis prepared for The Wall Street Journal by Moody's Economy.com, a unit of Moody's Corp., which adjusted the NAR Affordability Index for seasonal variations. Affordability dropped by more than 20% in nearly two-dozen markets, including Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., Spokane, Wash., and Orlando and Lakeland, Fla., according to the study. "You have to go back 25 years to find a decline that is as significant on a percentage basis," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tucson, where affordability has fallen 23% over the past year, buyers in all price ranges are feeling the pinch, says Kevin Freadhoff, an agent with Long Realty Co. Mr. Freadhoff says he's currently working with eight couples who would like to buy their first home but have been priced out of the market and a dozen others who already own a home, but are having trouble trading up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, declining affordability is forcing many home buyers to accept longer commutes, says Jane Powers, a broker with Ewing &amp;Clark Inc. It's also fueling price increases in outlying areas such as Bremerton, where affordability has fallen nearly 22% in the past year. And in Bergen County, N.J., where most starter homes are priced above $400,000, "prices have gone up to a point where it's pushing the first-time home buyer out of the market," says Margaret Foudy, manager of the Weichert Realtors office in Tenafly. That creates a "domino effect" as people who already own a home find it tougher to move up, says Ms. Foudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 57 of 379 metro areas nationwide, homes were so expensive in the third quarter that a family earning the median income couldn't afford the median-priced home based on traditional lending standards, according to Moody's Economy.com. Sixteen markets have joined the ranks of unaffordable areas over the past year, according to the analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, affordability isn't a problem in many parts of the country, including Winston-Salem, N.C., and Pittsburgh. The National Association of Realtors' Affordability Index has declined to 115 from this year's peak of 131 in January, according to Moody's Economy.com. The higher the number the more affordable homes are. Still, the index is above 100, a level that indicates the median-income family has the exact amount needed to buy the median-priced home, assuming a 20% down payment and a traditional mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like the yellow flag is out," says David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. But the decline in affordability is "a growing concern." Nationwide, mortgage rates would have to rise above 7% for the NAR's Affordability Index to drop below 100, he says. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages currently average 6.41% versus 5.83% a year ago, according to HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the homeownership rate stood at 68.7% in the third quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis. That's down slightly from a record 69.4% in the second quarter of 2004, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major analysis of affordability, by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo, shows that just above 43% of all new and existing homes sold in the third-quarter were affordable to families earning the median income. That's the lowest level since the index was first released in 1992 and compares with 50.4% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some factors have helped offset the decline in affordability. Many borrowers have embraced creative mortgage products, such as interest-only loans, mortgages with teaser rates of as low as 1% and "piggyback" loans aimed at buyers who don't have the money for a down payment. In the third quarter, borrowers could boost their purchasing power by 26% by taking out an interest-only mortgage, which allows a home buyer to put off repaying principal for several years, instead of a standard mortgage, according to Moody's Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tucson, roughly 60% of first-time home buyers make no down payment and instead now use 100% financing to get into the market, up from 30% two years ago, says Renee Booker, president of Long Mortgage, the mortgage arm of Long Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spokane, where affordability fell more than 28% over the past year, many first-time home buyers are using piggyback loans and 40-year mortgages, which have smaller monthly payments than traditional 30-year mortgages, to get into the market, says Laraine Hunter, a managing broker with John L. Scott Real Estate. "We're getting creative with helping people get into homes," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising short-term interest rates have made many affordability mortgage products more expensive and the flow of new, creative mortgage products has begun to lose steam. On Tuesday, bank regulators proposed controls that would limit the mass marketing of some creative mortgage products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As affordability declines, many first-time home buyers are being forced to lower their sights. In Phoenix, double-digit price increases are pushing many of these buyers to condominiums, to outlying locations or to blighted areas targeted by developers for renewal, says Bill Jilbert, president of Cendant Corp.'s Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orlando, young couples are being squeezed by rising home prices, says Barry Carnes, broker-owner of Century 21 A.A. Carnes Inc. Christine Cullum, a nurse, and her fiance, a salesman, recently made an unsuccessful bid on a $175,000 home in an Orlando suburb. They've since put in another bid on an older and smaller house in a different neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And renting remains a bargain in many parts of the country. Stephan Vrudny, an engineer who lives in San Diego, sold his three-bedroom condo to an investor in June for $405,000, then rented it back for $1,500 a month. Mr. Vrudny figures the arrangement is saving him $430 a month, even after taking into account the lost mortgage-interest deduction. "We'll be homeowners again when it makes sense again as an investment," says Mr. Vrudny, who had purchased the unit for $345,000 last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Charmed Life</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by a Boom</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baltimore has fought an uphill battle against urban decay to realize the promise of its "Charm City" nickname, and has garnered praise in recent decades for the transformation of its industrial waterfront into today's vibrant Inner Harbor with shopping pavilions and the retro-style Camden Yards baseball stadium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, row houses far from the splashy tourist attractions -- as well as suburban homes throughout the region on the Chesapeake Bay -- are getting a lift from the nationwide housing boom. Strengthening office-property values are following the residential market's lead. "Baltimore's reputation as a distressed city is changing," said Anirban Basu, chief executive of Sage Policy Group Inc., an economic consultancy group in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices in the Baltimore metro area have jumped from $154,800 in 2002, slightly below the national level, to $282,100 in the third quarter, or 31% above the U.S. median, according to the National Association of Realtors. City home values have also nearly doubled to a median of $131,000 last month since 2002, according to Metropolitan Regional Information Systems Inc. The boom is putting the brakes on the city's population decline, which is slowing after falling by 84,860 people from 1990 through 2000 -- the biggest numerical drop of any major city in the U.S. -- even as the region overall grew, according to the U.S. census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are betting that the trend back to the city will continue. According to TWR/Dodge Pipeline, 828 new condominiums are expected to be completed in Baltimore next year, up from 386 this year. City condo sales nearly doubled in the third quarter from the year earlier, though Katie Grove, president of the Greater Baltimore Board of Realtors, expects the rate of price appreciation to slow next year in the region's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the residential housing is in mixed-use projects that are pushing beyond the central business district into newly revitalized neighborhoods. Forest City Enterprises plans to begin construction next year on a 276,000-square-foot biotech building, which will be part of a larger project in East Baltimore. That complex is just north of the Johns Hopkins medical complex, which is to contain 1.1 million square feet of research and office space, as well as retail and residential; construction is planned to start next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's improving economy and spillover demand from the booming Washington real-estate market less than 40 miles away is also driving demand for the Baltimore region's apartment, office and retail sectors. Vacancies, already below the national average, fell in the third quarter from the year-earlier period while rents, though also below average, rose, according to Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston-based real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of office property sales is up sharply since 2002 -- in terms of dollar volume and square footage -- and prices are rising, though the average price per square foot paid of $147 for the year through October was still well below prices in the $400 range fetched in Washington, according to Real Capital Analytics in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are paying more. Wells Real Estate Funds, on behalf of its Wells REIT II, purchased the trophy office building known as 100 East Pratt in Baltimore's Inner Harbor for $316 per square foot this year. Don Miller, Wells's chief real-estate officer, said the city's proximity to Washington helped make the acquisition attractive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction rose more than expected in November, but some economists say the gains were largely tied to orders placed during the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts increased 5.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.123 million units last month, the largest increase since April. October starts, originally reported at 2.014 million, declined 6.6% to 2.017 million from September's 2.160 million rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's report also showed that permits for future building rose 2.5% last month to a 2.155 million annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was a little surprised by the strength" of new construction, said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. However, he said much of the activity was tied to new housing permits and sales orders placed several months ago. "The movement of the backlog of unused permits is now moving down. That combined with a modest downshift of permits being issued . . . signals that single-family housing starts are probably heading for an erosion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey this month by the NAHB shows that members have become more reliant on incentives to help sell houses, compared with six months ago, Mr. Seiders said. For example, home builders are more likely today to offer free upgrades -- such as for carpets -- or to pay closing costs or even reduce prices in some cases to stimulate sales, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter D. Schiff, president of brokerage firm Euro Pacific Capital Inc., questions why builders are continuing to put up new homes when demand appears to be slowing. "This reckless overbuilding will only exacerbate the magnitude of the price collapse in the coming housing bust."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bush administration officials, however, called the housing news positive. The construction figures are the "latest indication that the American economy is growing at a steady pace, and that the benefits of that growth are touching more Americans every day," Treasury Secretary John Snow said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, home-construction rates last month fell 1.3% to 989,000 in the South but rose 12.3% to 373,000 in the Midwest, 11% to 181,000 in the Northeast and 11.5% to 580,000 in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Labor Department said yesterday that the producer-price index for finished goods fell 0.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis in November, pushed down by falling energy prices. In October, the PPI -- which measures inflation at the producer, or wholesale, level -- rose 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Core" producer prices, which exclude food and energy, gained 0.1% in November following a 0.3% decline in October. However, prices for finished goods in the energy sector fell 4% last month, after rising 4.1% in October. Gasoline last month fell 10.7%, its sharpest drop since May 2003. The latest PPI report showed some pullback for prices in the production pipeline. Raw-materials prices dropped 1.2% in November -- their first decline since June -- after rising 6.7% in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest "that inflation at the producer price level is pretty tame," said Brian Bethune, a U.S. economist at Global Insight. In the past year, the dollar has gained strength against the Japanese yen and the euro, which has helped lower prices on some key imports of consumer and business goods, including computers, cars and cellphones, Mr. Bethune said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction in the U.S. rose, showing strength despite rising mortgage rates and higher prices for building materials, while inflation pressures at the wholesale level declined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said U.S. housing starts increased 5.3% to a seasonally adjusted 2.123 million annual rate last month. October starts, originally reported at 2.014 million, declined 6.6% to 2.017 million from September's 2.16 million. Permits for future building rose 2.5% to a 2.155 million annual rate, partially reversing a 5.2% slump in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains in new residential construction came despite rising borrowing costs and signs of wariness about prospects among U.S. home builders. Freddie Mac reported the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.3% last week, compared with 5.68% a year earlier. Meanwhile, a gauge of sentiment among home builders fell this month to its lowest level since April 2003, and building costs have risen amid posthurricane rebuilding along the Gulf Coast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The unsold inventory of new homes is climbing and mortgage purchase application volumes are flattening," Citigroup economist Steven Wieting wrote in a note. "We believe the large drop in home builder sentiment in the past two months is at least consistent with a flat period for residential investment just ahead."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose in all regions except the South, which posted a 1.3% decrease. Nationwide, an estimated 159,800 houses were actually started in November based on figures unadjusted for seasonal factors. An estimated 159,300 building permits were issued last month, also based on unadjusted figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department's U.S. producer-price index for finished goods fell 0.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis last month, retracing an unrevised 0.7% increase in October. The drop was led by a 4% fall in energy prices, which came after four months of gains related to higher crude-oil prices after hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused widespread shutdowns of Gulf Coast wells and refineries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, stripping away often volatile food and energy costs, the "core" PPI increased 0.1% in November following an unrevised 0.3% decline in October.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Home Report</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With anecdotal evidence abounding that the real-estate market is slowing, traders are watching today to see if November housing starts held above 2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that many investors consider the housing market a linchpin of the U.S. economy next year, this is a number that matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or does it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the subjective world of Wall Street, the allure of round numbers can be highly seductive. For instance, it shouldn't matter that the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- which, while the most widely recognized index, is but one of many -- is within shouting distance of a return to 11000. But after seeing the Dow fall back from 11000 so many times before, investors are obsessed with seeing it clear the level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts of 2 million? In many respects, it's an arbitrary number, especially considering it is annualized (that is, 12 times November's total) and also adjusted to compensate for seasonal effects. But amid concerns about the strength of the property market -- combined with light trading as the year comes to a close, it takes on greater importance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC reckon starts held above the 2 million mark. On average, they estimate that construction started on an annualized 2.025 million houses last month, up slightly from October's 2.014 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's not much conviction on the accuracy of that forecast, however. Measures of consumer and homebuilder sentiment -- not the surest of indicators -- showed that attitudes toward the housing market softened in November. On the other side of the ledger, the Labor Department reported that construction-sector employment jumped in November. But that may have had more to do with rebuilding in hurricane-struck areas than new building. And it's possible that hurricane relief has drained skilled labor away to the point where it's hampered construction on new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the starts number tops estimates, it probably won't shake investors' sense that the U.S. housing market is set to come off its torrid pace. But it could get them to think housing will slow gradually, rather than crash to a halt, which would be cheering enough. Heck, it might even help push the Dow over 11000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors expects sales of new and existing U.S. homes to drop to "high plateau" levels in 2006, while home prices continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, expected to rise 4.7% to a record 7.1 million this year, are projected to fall 3.7% in 2006 to 6.84 million, the second-biggest figure on record, the NAR said. The realtors' group foresees a similar trend for new homes, with sales projected to drop 4.8% next year to 1.23 million, also the second-biggest number on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales are coming down from a mountain peak, but they will level out at a high plateau -- a plateau that is higher than previous peaks in the housing cycle," NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said. "This transition to a more normal and balanced market is a good thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction is also expected to fall back after reaching this year the highest point since 1972. The NAR projects housing starts will decline 4.8% next year to 1.92 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite slowing activity, the NAR says it expects the national median home price to continue to increase next year, as it has each year since reliable record keeping began in 1968. The U.S. median price for existing homes is expected to rise 6.1% next year to $221,400 after an estimated 12.7% surge this year. The median price for new homes is projected to increase 7.3% next year to $250,100 after rising 5.5% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary price declines in certain areas are still possible if job markets are weak or housing is oversupplied, but the odds of home-price appreciation remain "very good," NAR President Thomas Stevens said. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A forward-looking index of U.S. home sales declined in October, another sign the housing market is cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales, based on contracts signed in October, declined 3.2% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted 123.8. The index was down 3.3% from a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few months, the U.S. housing market has been showing signs of slowing from the frenzied pace of the past five years, in which home sales set records and prices more than doubled in many areas. Clouding the picture, the U.S. Commerce Department last week estimated that new single-family homes sold in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million, up 13% from September. But economists cautioned that the small sample size in that survey could lead to large monthly fluctuations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' index is based on a larger sample, covering around 20% of sales of previously occupied homes. A sale is classified as pending if a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist, said the decline in the index indicates "a modest slowing in the housing sector" as interest rates rise, making homes less affordable. He added, "The index is pointing to a soft landing for home sales, which will help to correct the inventory shortages that have dominated housing over the last five years."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other economists warn that prices could fall, at least modestly, in some areas of the U.S. during the next few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said U.S. productivity grew more during the third quarter than first believed, reflecting a stronger economy, while an indicator of inflation and profit pressures was sharply lowered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 4.7% during the period that stretched from July through September, revised up from the earlier estimated 4.1% rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity is output divided by hours worked. The output figure comes from government data on gross domestic product, which is a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy. Since the original report was issued a month ago on third-quarter productivity, the government revised GDP, saying it grew by 4.3% during July through September instead of an originally reported 3.8% increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised increase marked the strongest productivity gain since mid-2003. Productivity might have been so strong in the third quarter because hurricanes in the South restrained hours worked, some analysts have suggested.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1361 words</div><div>7 December 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INDIVIDUALS ARE pulling back from buying homes and condos as an investment, in a move that could accelerate the cooling of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets such as Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix, San Diego and Washington, D.C., where investor activity had been heated, fewer people are competing to buy properties as an investment, real-estate brokers and housing analysts say. Some investor-owned properties are returning to the market for sale. With the pace of price appreciation slowing, some investors who were betting on quick profits are instead being squeezed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent pullback by investors is recent and is just beginning to show up in national data. Evidence of the development can also be seen in a number of markets that had until recently been a hotbed of investor activity. As speculators withdraw from the market in San Diego, for instance, the number of investors buying property has fallen by nearly half, estimates Russ Valone, president of MarketPointe Realty Advisors, which tracks the San Diego housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Phoenix area, as many as 30% of properties for sale are currently owned by investors, says Jay Butler, director of the Arizona Real Estate Center at Arizona State University. Six months ago, most investors were buying rather than selling, he says. The shift has helped to drive up inventories of homes for sale in the Phoenix area, which climbed to 22,340 in October from 8,600 in April, according to data from the Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest sign that the housing market is cooling, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday that its index of pending home sales dropped 3.2% in October. The reading is the lowest since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's too early to tell just how a pullback by investors will affect the broader housing market, but their impact on the housing boom has been considerable. Investors accounted for 9.6% of mortgages used to purchase homes in the first nine months of this year, the most recent data available, up from 6.7% in 2002, according to LoanPerformance, a unit of First American Corp. But the investor share began to drop in the third quarter, the firm says. The figures don't include second homes that may also provide rental income and serve as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A softening in investor demand is likely to accentuate any slowdown in home sales, says David Berson, chief economist at mortgage giant Fannie Mae. He estimates that home sales will fall 10.4% over the next two years, largely because of a decline in investor and second-home purchases. Mr. Berson also figures that without the recent surge in these purchases, home sales would have been 7.3% lower in each of the past two years. That estimate assumes that investment properties and second homes account for 10% of total sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern is that investors will be quicker to sell if prices soften, accentuating any downturn, particularly in areas where speculation has been most prevalent. Some of the most vulnerable markets include Daytona, Fla., Las Vegas, Phoenix and Fresno and Bakersfield, Calif., according to Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Dennis McGill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if investors don't all rush for the exits at once, more investor-owned properties are likely to return to the market over the next few years. In part, that's because many investors have bought preconstruction properties that won't be ready for occupancy for another year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, investor demand remains strong in some parts of the country as investors take their profits in markets that have seen double-digit gains and move into areas such as Dallas, where price gains haven't been so steep. And while it's getting tougher for speculators to make a quick buck, brokers say that opportunities remain for investors who plan to hold their properties for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Sandra Geary, a broker in California's Sonoma County, was running seminars that drew as many as 200 would-be investors. She's also taken California investors on out-of-state home-buying expeditions to Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Oregon and bought more than 30 rental properties for her own portfolio. But in recent months, her investor sales have fallen more than 75%. "Now that the market is slowing down, it's scaring investors away," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers are advising speculators to put away their checkbooks. "I'm telling people who want to buy new construction to flip it that the gig is up," says Frank Borges LLosa, a real-estate agent in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mike Morgan, a real-estate broker in Stuart, Fla., set up a Web site designed to attract investors scouring the Internet for preconstruction properties. But with the market softening, Mr. Morgan has cut back on promoting his site. Now, he works only with investors seeking "buy and hold" properties. "I haven't sold an investor a property to flip since June," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors also are backing out of preconstruction properties they bought. In San Diego, cancellation rates for new condominium units climbed 47% in the third quarter over the second, in part because a growing number of investors are getting cold feet, according to the Building Industry Association of San Diego County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancellation rates for condo units are also rising in many other markets, including Florida and metropolitan Washington, according to the National Association of Home Builders. "It's largely because of investors" pulling back, says NAHB staff vice president for research Gopal Ahluwalia. "A whole lot of condo units are sitting empty." Whether a buyer can easily get out of a deal can depend on a number of factors, including the builder's policies and the terms of the buyer's contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With price appreciation slowing, it's getting tougher for investors looking to quickly flip a property to earn a return that's high enough to cover brokerage commissions, mortgage costs and other expenses. Prices for existing homes are expected to rise 12.4% this year, according to the National Association of Realtors, well above the 5.3% average annual gain since 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are already getting pinched. Barry Fiske, an account manager, teamed up with a friend to buy a bungalow in the oceanside town of Hingham, Mass. The pair tore down the house and put up a three-story Victorian home that went on the market in October, priced at $889,000. After three price cuts, the asking price is now $799,000 and the opportunities to profit are "marginal," Mr. Fiske says. "We probably spent more than we originally intended to," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Cayouette, a computer programmer, has put down deposits on 10 homes under construction in Florida, figuring he'd quickly flip them and make a profit of about $30,000 apiece. The first of those purchases, a three-bedroom home in Port St. Lucie, is expected to close this month. But Mr. Cayouette has learned he'll be lucky if the house fetches $285,000, or $10,000 less than his original purchase price. "I wouldn't be able to flip it if I wanted to," says Mr. Cayouette.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices growing faster than rental rates, investors who decide to rent out their properties rather than sell them often can't make enough to cover mortgage payments, taxes and other costs. Arash Yazdi, an information technology consultant, decided to rent out his $465,000 townhouse in Merrifield, Va., this fall after a deal to sell the home fell through. He figures he's losing about $1,000 a month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Jon E. Hilsenrath </div><div>698 words</div><div>7 December 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of U.S. home sales declined in October, in another sign the housing market is cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales, based on contracts signed in October, declined 3.2% from September to a seasonally adjusted 123.8. The reading was down 3.3% from a year earlier. The index was 100 in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few months, the nation's housing market has been showing signs of slowing from the frenzied pace of the past five years, during which home sales set records and prices more than doubled in many areas. Clouding the picture, the Commerce Department last week estimated that new single-family homes sold in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million, up 13% from September. But economists cautioned that a small sample size means the estimate has a wide margin of error.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR index is based on a large sample, covering about 20% of sales of existing homes. A sale is classified as pending if a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed. David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, said the decline in the index indicates "a modest slowing in the housing sector" as interest rates rise, making houses less affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing slowdown could hurt the economy more broadly, because consumers have partly financed their spending by drawing wealth out of their homes through home-equity loans and refinancing packages. But a separate report from the Labor Department pointed to a vigorous underlying economy. It showed that the productivity of U.S. workers grew more quickly during the third quarter than first believed. Meanwhile, an important indicator of inflation declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's index of productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 4.7% from July to September. The increase, raised from 4.1%, is the largest productivity gain since mid-2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The productivity index represents a measure of the nation's output as a percentage of the hours worked by laborers. The government recently raised its estimate of output -- or gross domestic product -- for the third quarter. That helps to explain the upward revision to productivity growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another measure of productivity growth also showed remarkable strength. Productivity at nonfinancial corporations, which is watched closely by Federal Reserve officials, rose at a 3.2% rate in the quarter and was 4.7% higher than a year earlier. In the 1970s and 1980s, the annual rate of productivity growth was less than 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is pretty astounding that we are getting such a high rate of [productivity] growth," said Martin Baily, a senior adviser to consulting firm McKinsey &amp;Co. "Recent numbers seem consistent with a productivity trend for nonfarm business that is close to 3%. For a while, it looked as if we were drifting back toward the two to 2 1/2 range."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McKinsey's research arm, the McKinsey Global Institute, recently found in a study that more sectors are participating in the productivity boom today than in the late 1990s. Back then, productivity growth was concentrated in a few sectors, including retail and wholesale trade, finance and computers and electronics. The latest study said sectors such as restaurants, administrative support, real estate and construction have contributed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity growth is important because it helps companies contain labor costs. The Labor Department said unit labor costs declined at a 1% annual rate in the third quarter, more than the previously reported 0.5% decline. Unit labor costs are the compensation paid to labor for one unit of output. The Fed watches unit labor costs to gauge inflationary pressures within the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest productivity report may be an aberration. The third quarter was heavily affected by unusual events like hurricanes and deep discounting among auto makers. But economists said the decline in unit labor costs should help to ease the Fed's worries that inflation is becoming embedded in economic activity. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severance-pay packages have grown more generous in recent years, especially for the executive ranks, according to a new study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of weeks employers provide severance benefits has grown for senior executives and nonsenior executives, according to the survey. Also, more companies are adopting outplacement benefits -- or services that help terminated workers find a new job -- as well as retention bonuses, payments that ensure terminated employees will continue with the company up to a specified termination date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey, conducted by Lee Hecht Harrison, a consulting and career-services company in Woodcliff Lake, N.J, analyzed responses from 1,030 senior human-resources executives at U.S. organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found that the median maximum severance payout period for senior executives rose to 52 weeks, double the median of 26 weeks reported in 2001, the last time the firm conducted this survey. For non-senior executives, the median maximum payout increased to 28 weeks from 26 weeks. It remained the same, 26 weeks, for professionals and administrative staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industries where severance packages have grown more generous in recent years include aerospace and defense, computers and software, consumer products and electronics, food, beverage and tobacco, insurance and telecommunications. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' index is based on a larger sample, covering around 20% of sales of previously occupied homes. A sale is classified as pending if a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist, said the decline in the index indicates "a modest slowing in the housing sector" as interest rates rise, making houses less affordable. He added: "The index is pointing to a soft landing for home sales, which will help to correct the inventory shortages that have dominated housing over the last five years."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other economists warn that prices could fall, at least modestly, in some areas of the country during the next few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index equates 100 to the average level of activity in 2001. The Realtors said the level of sales remains strong by historical standards. By region, the index edged up 0.8% from a month earlier in the West but declined 2.5% in the South, 6.3% in the Midwest and 6.9% in the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said U.S. productivity grew more during the third quarter than first believed, reflecting a stronger economy, while an indicator of inflation and profit pressures was sharply lowered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 4.7% during the period that stretched from July through September, revised up from the earlier estimated 4.1% rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Productivity is output divided by hours worked. The output figure comes from government data on gross domestic product, which is a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy. Since the original report was issued a month ago on third-quarter productivity, the government revised GDP, saying it grew by 4.3% during July through September instead of an originally reported 3.8% increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revised increase marked the highest productivity gain since mid-2003. Productivity might have been so strong in the third quarter because hurricanes in the South restrained hours worked, some analysts have suggested. Payrolls rose by only 61,000 jobs in September and October. Employment growth rebounded to 215,000 jobs in November alone, an indication the third quarter's 4.7% productivity gain could be a bit of an aberration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit labor costs slipped 1%, a revision from the previously reported 0.5% decline. Unit labor costs are the compensation paid to labor for one unit of output. The Federal Reserve watches unit labor costs to weigh inflationary pressures within the economy.  </p>

</div><div class="author">BRIAN S. WESBURY   </div><div>1166 words</div><div>1 December 2005</div><div>23:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal (Online and Print)</div><div>WSJO</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a quarter century of analyzing and forecasting the economy, I have never seen anything like this. No matter what happens, no matter what data are released, no matter which way markets move, a pall of pessimism hangs over the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is amazing. Everything is negative. When bond yields rise, it is considered bad for the housing market and the consumer. But if bond yields fall and the yield curve narrows toward inversion, that is bad too, because an inverted yield curve could signal a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If housing data weaken, as they did on Monday when existing home sales fell, well that is a sign of a bursting housing bubble. If housing data strengthen, as they did on Tuesday when new home sales rose, that is negative because the Fed may raise rates further. If foreigners buy our bonds, we are not saving for ourselves. If foreigners do not buy our bonds, interest rates could rise. If wages go up, inflation is coming. If wages go down, the economy is in trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This onslaught of negative thinking is clearly having an impact. During the 2004 presidential campaign, when attacks on the economy were in full force, 36% of Americans thought we were in recession. One year later, even though unemployment has fallen from 5.5% to 5%, and real GDP has expanded by 3.7%, the number who think a recession is underway has climbed to 43%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a real conundrum. It is true, bad things have happened. Katrina wiped out a major city and many people are still displaced. GM has announced massive layoffs. Underfunded pension plans are being handed off to the government. Oil, gasoline and natural gas prices have soared. Despite it all, the U.S. economy continues to flourish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One would think that this would give pouting pundits reason to question their pessimism. After all, politicians who bounce back from scandal get monikers such as "the comeback kid." Athletes who overcome personal tragedy or sickness to achieve greatness are called "heroes." This is a quintessential American tradition, and the economy is following the script perfectly. The more hardship it faces, the more resilient it appears. The list of pessimistic forecasts that have been proved wrong grows by the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade deficit was supposed to cause a collapse in the dollar; but the dollar is up 10% versus the euro in the past eight months. The budget deficit was supposed to push up interest rates; yet the 10-year Treasury yield, at 4.5%, is well below its 2000 average yield of 6% when the U.S. faced surpluses as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp declines in consumer confidence and rising oil prices were supposed to hurt retail sales; but holiday shopping is strong. Many fear that China is stealing our jobs, but new reports suggest that U.S. manufacturers are so strong that a shortage of skilled production workers has developed. And since the Fed started hiking interest rates 16 months ago, 3.5 million new jobs and $750 billion in additional personal income have been created. Stocks are also up, which according to pundits was unlikely as long as the Fed was hiking rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, where is all of the pessimism coming from? Some say that the anxiety is warranted. The theory goes like this: Globalization and technology are a massive force that levels the playing field. Because capital and ideas can move freely around the world, foreign wages will move up, while U.S. wages fall, until some sort of equilibrium is found. It's a compelling story. After all, real average hourly earnings in the U.S. fell 1.6% during the 12 months ending in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there are numerous reasons to believe that this statistic is not giving an accurate picture of the economy's health. First, history shows that when oil prices rise sharply, real earnings take a temporary hit. As a result, a snapshot of inflation-adjusted earnings data in the wake of Katrina is misleading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, for the past 30 years, real average hourly earnings have declined by an annual average of 0.1%. But this can't possibly reflect reality. In the past 30 years, cell phones and computers have become ubiquitous. Home and auto ownership have climbed. More people dine out; travel; attend sporting events, movies and rock concerts; and join health clubs. Over those same 30 years, real per capita consumption has increased at an average annual rate of 2.3%. Hourly earnings data do not include tips, bonuses, commissions or benefits, and therefore will always lag actual increases in living standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some observers of the current economy, such as New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman and former Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling, argue correctly that globalization is inevitable and, in fact, good. Nonetheless, they focus on those who are hurt by the transitional impact and suggest that government intervene to offset any damage from plant closures or job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this has never worked. The history of economic progress is one of innovation and change. This "creative destruction" can never be a pain-free experience for every individual involved. The new must replace the old. Attempting to alter this fact of life, and create a utopia where no one experiences pain, has always led to more unhappiness than before. Germany's near 11% unemployment rate and the recent riots in France are the latest evidence of government's inability to successfully fight market forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key reason the U.S. economy has outperformed other industrialized nations, and exceeded its long-run average growth rate during the past two years, is the tax cut of 2003. By reducing taxes on investment, the U.S. boosted growth, which in turn created new jobs that replace those that are lost as the old economy dies. Ireland is also a beautiful example of the power of tax cuts to boost growth and lift living standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth is the only true shock absorber for an economy in transition. To minimize the pain of technological globalization and address the anxiety that these forces are creating, free-market policies must be followed. While tremendous pressures are building to increase government involvement in the economy, it is important that the U.S. stay the course that brought it out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To meet the challenges that lie ahead, a vibrant, flexible and expanding economy is absolutely necessary. While it is tempting to think that government programs are necessary to address anxiety, in reality only the free market can successfully navigate today's rough waters. In the end, it will be the private sector, not the public sector, that quells all this anxiety and creates the opportunities so many desire.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling gasoline prices and an improving job outlook caused U.S. consumer confidence levels to surge in November, said a report released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the U.S. Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes surged 13% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.424 million, the largest gain since sales grew 16.4% in April 1993. Economists surveyed by and CNBC had expected sales to fall 0.3%. September sales rose an upwardly revised 0.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the Commerce Department said durable-goods orders rose 3.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted $214.39 billion after falling a revised 2% in September. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC had forecast orders would advance 1.5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research company, reported that its index of consumer confidence for November improved strongly to a reading of 98.9, from October's revised 85.2. The level achieved in November was above the 90 predicted by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires, and it proved to be the best reading since August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A decline of more than 40 cents in gasoline prices this month and the improving job outlook have combined to help restore consumers' confidence," said Lynn Franco, who directs the survey for the Conference Board. She noted that while the report has not yet fully shrugged off the impact of this year's devastating hurricane season, the gain in confidence is coming at a welcome time, as the holiday spending season kicks off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were small gains in consumers who deemed the economy "good," which rose to 25.5% of the survey, from 23.3% who said the same thing a month ago. Those who consider current economic circumstances "bad" slipped to 17.3% of respondents in November, versus 18.4% in October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group also reported that its present-situation index, which aims to describe how consumer feel about their current lot, stood at 114.0, from October's revised 107.8.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The combined impact of a dropoff in energy prices and continued solid economic performance comforted households, who had been concerned in the immediate aftermath of Katrina and Rita that the expansion would fall victim to the storms' effects on the energy sector," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs, James R. Hagerty and Kemba Dunham </div><div>777 words</div><div>30 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New U.S. home sales in October soared to their fastest monthly pace in 12 years, evidence that while the housing market may be cooling in some sectors, overall it is still relatively healthy. Separately, November's consumer confidence and October's demand for manufactured goods surged -- all signs of stabilizing economic conditions for the remainder of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes rose sharply last month, the Commerce Department said, but many analysts questioned the report's reliability, saying they believe the housing market is on a cooling trend as mortgage rates rise and inventories of unsold homes grow. New single-family homes sold last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million, up 13% from the pace recorded in September, according to the department's latest estimate. The figure is 9% above the level posted for October 2004. Last month's surge is the largest since sales increased 16.4% in April 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales data came a day after the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously occupied homes fell 2.7% in October. The association's figures reflect home sales that were completed in the latest month; most of those sales are based on contracts signed a month or two earlier. By contrast, the data on new-home sales are more recent because they are based on initial sales agreements in the latest month, not completed transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders appear to have maintained sales at a brisk level, partly by holding down prices. The median price of new homes in October was $231,300, up just 0.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's far below the recent trend for price increases. Over the past 24 months, prices for new homes on average have increased 9.7% from the year-earlier levels. Some builders also have been offering generous incentives that don't figure into the price, such as finished basements and golf-club memberships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Oppenheim, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, said the new data "appear to be an aberration." He said his firm's surveys of home builders show that demand generally has been cooling. Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, termed the latest sales data "bizarre." He said his group's recent surveys indicate that sales generally have been slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some analysts read the report as encouraging for the housing market. Though the data "can be extremely volatile" from month to month, said Michelle Girard, an analyst at RBS Greenwich Capital, "these numbers clearly indicate that housing demand remains robust. Some cooling seems likely going forward, but declarations of a collapse in the housing sector are premature."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of homes continue to build, something that eventually could weigh on prices. The department estimated that 501,000 homes were available for sale at the end of October, up 21% from a year earlier. Of those homes, about 20% hadn't yet been started, while 58% were under construction and 21% were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new orders for durable goods rose a surprisingly strong 3.4% in October, following a revised 2% drop in September prompted by the aftereffects of the three Gulf Coast hurricanes and a strike at Boeing Co. that weakened aircraft and parts orders. Also, shipments of manufactured goods increased 1.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The manufacturing sector has held up quite well despite supply-chain disruptions," said Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI chief economist Daniel J. Meckstroth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meckstroth said a better reading is obtained from nondefense capital-goods orders, excluding aircraft, which fell 1.7% in September and rose 1.3% in October. Despite the data's volatility, he said it appears that production is "on an accelerating path in the fourth quarter" in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a pent-up demand for inventories because inventories have been driven to an extremely low level," he said. "The demand to build inventories accelerates industrial production."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence appears to be emerging from a worrisome phase with the report of a 13-point surge in the Conference Board's November consumer-confidence index. The New York-based research group's index rose to 98.9, up from 85.2 in October and 87.5 in September. The rise follows less encouraging numbers from the University of Michigan's November consumer-sentiment index last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's consumer-research director, said declining gas prices combined with an improved job outlook helped to boost consumer confidence. </p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty and Kemba J. Dunham </div><div>2362 words</div><div>30 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT WORTH, Texas -- As a young man, Donald J. Tomnitz watched the arrival of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. doom his aunt's local drugstore in Mexico, Mo. Today, as chief executive of one of America's biggest home builders, D.R. Horton Inc., Mr. Tomnitz likes to compare his company to the steamroller that put his aunt out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Wal-Mart and Horton were founded by folksy entrepreneurs rooted in Arkansas. Both cater mainly to moderate-income customers and have relied on high volume and rigorous cost controls to crush less-efficient competitors. Both have stellar long-term records: Horton, which sells more new homes than any other company in the U.S., says it has recorded a rise in earnings for every single quarter since it was founded in 1978.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Wal-Mart has long inspired awe on Wall Street, Horton and its biggest rivals are struggling to win respect from investors, who tend to view the industry as prone to boom and bust cycles. Fifteen years ago, when housing markets in parts of the country slumped, some large home builders ended up in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as interest rates rise, the boom that has more than doubled house prices in many U.S. cities over the past five years appears to be nearing an end. Investors have driven down home-builder stocks by nearly 18% since their July 20 peak, as measured by a Banc of America Securities index of the industry. Though the Commerce Department estimated yesterday that sales of new homes in October surged to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million, up 13% from September's pace, the median price of those homes was up just 0.9% from a year earlier and most analysts say the market will slow in the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton and other big home builders insist they can keep increasing sales and profits rapidly even if the housing market slumps. They believe any downturn will be short-lived. And as the market consolidates into fewer hands, the big companies say they can squeeze suppliers for lower costs, grab the best land available and take market share from smaller rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can earn our way through any economic cycle, except one like the Great Depression," says Mr. Tomnitz, a former banker and Army captain who has served as D.R. Horton's CEO since 1998, six years after the company went public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton, which dubs itself "America's Builder," says it will sell 100,000 newly built homes in 2010, nearly double the 51,172 it sold during its latest fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The company also projects that earnings will grow 15% to 20% annually over the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte Homes Inc., the No. 2 builder behind Horton in terms of unit sales, forecasts that it will deliver over 10% more homes in 2006 than it will this year. KB Home, the fifth-largest builder, projects annual earnings growth of 20% to 25% for each of the next three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors and analysts are skeptical about these goals. "These are still cyclical companies in a cyclical industry," says Ivy Zelman, a Cleveland-based analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Others are more worried. When the current house-price boom ends, says Peter D. Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital Inc., a stockbrokerage firm in Darien, Conn., home-builder stocks "are going to collapse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. home-building industry still includes some 80,000 companies, most of them tiny local outfits, but it is changing dramatically. Five years ago, the top 10 home builders controlled only about 10% of the U.S. market. Now their share is about 25%, and the big builders predict it will top 50% within a decade. The top 10 had combined revenue of about $73 billion in 2004, up from $13 billion a decade earlier, according to Builder magazine, a trade publication. Five home builders are now in the S&amp;P 500-stock index, including D.R. Horton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As their companies bulk up and Americans obsess over the value of their homes, chief executives of the biggest builders have become regular guests on business TV channels. They also pay themselves like investment bankers. Bruce Karatz, chief executive of KB Home, earned $23.9 million last year, including base salary, bonus, restricted stock awards and long-term incentive pay. Total CEO compensation for the other top five builders last year ranged from about $8.7 million at Horton to $19 million at Centex Corp. That compares with a median of $6 million for CEOs of all S&amp;P 500 companies, according to Corporate Library, a corporate governance advisory firm in Portland, Maine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is turning into one of the nation's "core" industries, as auto manufacturing did in the early part of the last century, KB's Mr. Karatz says. Americans spent around $417 billion on newly built homes in 2004, estimates Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders. That compared with $687 billion of new car sales in the same year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big difference from the auto makers: Builders have relatively small work forces. Horton employs about 8,900 people, compared with 325,000 at General Motors Corp. That's because home builders subcontract virtually all of the construction to specialist firms in such trades as framing, electrical wiring and plumbing. "I view this business as a form of retailing," says Gregory E. Gieber, an analyst who tracks home building at A.G. Edwards &amp;Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Their job is to design, market and sell something which they don't actually manufacture." That means the home builders don't have to pay severance costs if their demand for construction labor suddenly drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton already builds homes in 74 metropolitan areas in 25 states. It expects to branch out further, hopscotching its way from sprawling cities to growing towns nearby. By using the existing staff in the big cities to manage the new areas, it avoids adding new layers of administrative costs. In these smaller "satellite" markets, where few big housing companies venture, Horton believes it can grab business from what Mr. Tomnitz calls "pickup-truck builders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new market where Horton recently acquired lots for new homes is Baton Rouge, La., which is booming as refugees from Hurricane Katrina seek housing there. Horton plans to use existing management teams in Texas to help oversee the Baton Rouge expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton bought 17 companies between 1994 and 2002, a period in which acquisitions accounted for about half of the company's growth. Its most recent major acquisition was the $653 million purchase of Schuler Homes Inc. in 2002, which helped vault Horton into the industry's No. 1 spot in terms of unit sales that year. While he doesn't rule out further acquisitions, Mr. Tomnitz says he is focused on growing the company without them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton and other large builders say they now have enough financial strength to give them a big edge over small and midsize competitors in negotiating with suppliers and in bidding for choice plots of land, which can sell for more than $100 million. Horton estimates that it saves $3,500 per home by negotiating national contracts with suppliers of such things as appliances and roofing tiles. The big builders also can afford to fight long legal battles over zoning or spend years persuading local politicians to back their development plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton also expects to grow by constructing more townhouses and condominium buildings in states like California and New Jersey, where prices of houses with their own yards have soared beyond the reach of many buyers. Until 1996, the company built only detached single-family homes with their own plot of land. In the 12 months to Sept. 30, condo buildings, duplexes, townhouses and other so-called attached homes made up about 17% of Horton's sales and the company expects that figure to grow. By squeezing more families into smaller spaces, Horton executives say they can keep prices affordable and attract buyers who otherwise would have to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's big home builders say they have learned lessons from the past, when the companies often found themselves carrying too much debt and owning too much land during market slumps. Today, big builders increasingly negotiate options to buy land rather than immediately purchasing it outright, a technique that gives them an escape route if their land needs prove smaller than expected. They have stronger balance sheets than before. The median debt load for major builders is 43% of their capital, down from 57% in 1990, according to Ms. Zelman, the CSFB analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Ms. Zelman argues that the home builders haven't insulated themselves from downturns. She thinks housing demand in recent years has been artificially inflated by the lowest interest rates in four decades, an influx of investors speculating on higher home prices and lenient loan terms -- factors likely to diminish as the market cools. Investors and buyers of second homes accounted for 18% of sales of new and previously owned homes in this year's first half. "What happens if 15% of demand goes away?" asks Ms. Zelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman doesn't expect the big home builders to implode. But she does think that profit margins will shrink in the next few years as the market cools. If home prices are flat or fall, she doesn't believe Horton will be able to meet its target of recording double-digit profit growth every year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton executives reject any suggestion that they are vulnerable to a weakening market. "We're a double-digit company," Mr. Tomnitz said on a recent conference call with analysts. Horton and other builders are counting on population growth and immigration to underpin the market in the long term. They also note that land is in chronically short supply near the coasts where rapid job growth fuels demand for housing. That scarcity of space helps support prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton's brash goals reflect the personality of its chairman and founder, Donald Ray Horton. Mr. Horton, the son of a sheriff who later became a real-estate broker, was born in a rural home near Marshall, Ark., with no indoor plumbing. At age 21, he quit college to run the real-estate agency started by his father. A few years later, the younger Mr. Horton moved to Fort Worth, where he found a job selling new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After selling homes for less than a year, Mr. Horton concluded that it would be more lucrative to build them as well. "It looked pretty simple to me," he says. Starting with savings of $3,000, he persuaded a bank to lend him $30,000 to launch the company in 1978. While his first house was still under construction, Mr. Horton sold it for $43,560, giving him the funds to start immediately on two more homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the late 1980s, Horton was one of the biggest home builders in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Mr. Horton then began expanding in other cities -- starting with Phoenix, Orlando, Fla., and Atlanta. The company has concentrated mainly on the Sunbelt because "that's where the job growth is," Mr. Horton says. But the company also has spread north to such states as Oregon, Illinois and New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horton puts part of the company's success down to low costs. In 2004, Horton's sales, general and administrative costs came to about 9.2% of revenue, compared with a range of about 10% to 14% for the four other builders that make up the industry's Big Five, according to an analysis by Banc of America Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Horton executives cherish the company's legends of penny-pinching. Mr. Tomnitz boasts that his office furniture was bought second-hand, as were the company's boardroom table and chairs. Another senior executive says that when he first joined the company in the 1980s he noticed that a clerk was re-rolling adding-machine tape so she could use both sides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's local chiefs get a lot of independence, but Horton watches their spending and results closely. Gordon D. Jones, a chief operating officer responsible for nine central states, says he compares the costs of each local division he supervises "to make sure we're not getting hosed" by suppliers. Mr. Jones says Mr. Horton also scours over the fine details of divisional spending. "He knows how much you're spending on Dumpsters," Mr. Jones says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Horton cautions managers against complacency. According to one of the company's maxims, known as Hortonisms, "It's a quick trip from the penthouse to the doghouse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite soaring sales, D.R. Horton regularly ranks dismally in customer-satisfaction surveys done by J.D. Power &amp;Associates, a Westlake Village, Calif., consulting firm best known for its rankings of automotive quality. In the latest report from Power, released in September, Horton rated average or below in each of the 25 cities where its customers were surveyed. The surveys cover the quality of workmanship and materials, price and value, and home design. Rivals Pulte and Centex do far better on the surveys -- and trumpet the results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horton says the company, in which his family still owns a 13% stake, couldn't sell so many homes if it wasn't pleasing customers. Now 55 years old, he also says he spends most of his time thinking about how to make his company better in the long run, not how to impress Wall Street or outside consultants. One recent thought is that Horton eventually might provide in-home services that would allow old people to keep living in their own single-family houses rather than moving into group homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Christine Haughney and Ruth Simon </div><div>1038 words</div><div>29 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME OF THE nation's largest lenders are cutting back on financing and are tightening standards for condominium projects, a sign that banks, which helped to fuel the run-up in real-estate prices with cheap debt, may be growing more skeptical about the prospects for residential properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, lenders have been requiring developers to put more of their own money into projects, sell units faster, and prove that they have experience completing these condos. Many banks have cut back on loans in markets where there has been the most building and investors already have bought up a large number of new condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lenders are looking toward more worst-case scenarios," says Dwight Dunton, president of Bonaventure Realty Group LLC, a real-estate developer based in Arlington, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo market has been booming. So far this year, the number of existing condo and co-op units sold has risen 37% since 2002, and median prices have risen 53%, according to the National Association of Realtors. The median price of an existing unit increased 15% in October from a year ago to $229,800, the association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the number of units sold declined for the second month in a row, a hint that the market might be cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some banks have stopped lending entirely in particular areas. "We are definitely slowing down and charging a lot more for it," says Brian Harris, managing director and global head of commercial real estate at UBS AG. "We are out of Las Vegas. We are very much out of Miami, and we are hesitant in New York City."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merrill Lynch &amp;Co. is concentrating on lending to condo developers it has worked with before. Commercial-finance company CapitalSource Finance LLC now requires condominium converters to sell about a third of the units in advance compared with about 20% previously. Bear Stearns Cos. recently cut the share of the total cost of a project for which it would lend to about 75% to 80% from 80% to 85% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to make sure that the borrower has skin in the game and is as motivated to sell the units as we are," says Christopher Hoeffel, a Bear Stearns senior managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, developers are rethinking their plans. Dan Kodsi, president of Royal Palm Communities, a developer in Boca Raton, Fla., says his firm is taking a more conservative approach to its next project, a 60-story, 500-unit condo tower in the hot Miami market. Typically, the firm would try to sell units before going to lenders with the sales numbers to lock in financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Kodsi says he wants to make sure he can get financing before he starts selling units he then would be committed to delivering. Mr. Kodsi says he has been approached by brokers representing developers who have presold condo units and now don't want to see the project through in the face of tighter lending standards and higher construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending standards are squeezing out new developers who benefited from the recent largess of these financial institutions. Matthew Texler, a vice president with commercial mortgage brokerage Meridian Capital Group LLC, says developers who want financing have to show what their target market is, how they will get marketing support from local brokers, and how deep a sponsor's pockets are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we saw in the last 12 to 24 months was so many people who had never done a condo deal in their lives getting into the condo market," Mr. Texler says. Now, "it's becoming very difficult for the newbies to get their deals done."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonaventure's Mr. Dunton says lenders are looking more closely at risks, worrying that projects may take longer than expected to sell out, analyzing what would happen if sales prices fall by 10%, 15% or even 20% and calculating what the project's value would be if all of the units had to be rented. Mr. Dunton says his firm has shifted its focus away from Washington and has put it on markets such as Charleston, S.C., where the economics make more sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While scores of developers risk going bust when they can't get financing, tightening lending standards ultimately may help the condo market. "To the extent that supply is slowed down, that's a good thing," says Timothy Martorella, managing director of Miami-based Madison Capital Group, a real-estate investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only better-quality projects are likely to be financed and completed, says Howard Michaels, chairman of Carlton Advisory Group in New York, which has arranged $2 billion in financing for its condominium projects across the U.S. in the past 12 months, including an $840 million condominium-conversion project on Manhattan's Upper East Side. "The easy money is over, and our business is getting stronger," he says. But inexperienced developers may "have trouble on their hands," he says. "They could get stuck holding the bag." Those who paid high prices for land or buildings may have to refinance their loans or turn condominium units that don't sell into rental apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lenders say that with lots of projects under way, they already have a lot of loans on their books. General Electric Co.'s GE Commercial Finance Real Estate division estimates that the number of new condominium units planned, under construction or for sale nationwide jumped to 100,000 a month in January, from 10,000 to 20,000 units a month from 2003 to 2005, leading the firm to limit lending in areas including Las Vegas, Southern Florida and Northern Virginia. Although the company still will lend in cities such as Washington; Phoenix; Jacksonville, Fla., and Manhattan's Upper East Side, it has less than 10% of its $36 billion real-estate portfolio in condominium loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's just nervousness that we're going to end up with too many" units, says Michael Pralle, president and chief executive of GE Real Estate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>575 words</div><div>29 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes slowed in October as inventories of unsold properties continued to grow, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said home sales -- including single-family, townhouses, condominiums and cooperatives -- set a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 7.1 million units last month, down 2.7% from September. Inventories increased 3.5% to 2.9 million homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing activity has peaked and is coming down a bit," said David Lereah, the association's chief economist, "and we expect further cooling in the coming months." He predicted that the boom will settle down gently as interest rates continue to climb, raising the cost of buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other housing watchers are more worried about the outlook. Ivy L. Zelman, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, estimated in a report released yesterday that investors and second-home buyers accounted for 18% of home sales in this year's first half, up from 15% for all of 2004. "We are concerned that investors have artificially inflated home prices in many metro markets," Ms. Zelman wrote. Owners of investment properties and second homes can quickly dump them on the market, putting downward pressure on prices, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, many investors have done very well. The Realtors said the median home price in October was $218,000, up 16.6% from a year earlier. The data are for home sales that were completed in October. Most of those sales are based on contracts signed a month or two earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales declined 7.4% from September in the Northeast, 1.9% in the Midwest, 1.8% in the South and 1.2% in the West. Compared with October 2004, nationwide sales in the latest month were up 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of condos and cooperative housing alone declined 4.4% from September but were up 6.7% from October 2004. The median condo price was $229,800, up 15.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of single-family homes are sufficient to last 4.8 months at the current sales rate, up from 4.3 months a year earlier. Inventories of condos and cooperative homes are equivalent to 5.5 months of sales, up from 4.5 months in October 2004. That means buyers feel less pressure to buy quickly and are more inclined to bargain on pricing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding second-home buyers, investors alone accounted for 10.5% of home sales in the first half, Ms. Zelman estimated, compared with 9.1% in all of 2004 and just 3.8% in 2000. The analyst said she believes investor demand peaked in the second quarter. Markets that are most vulnerable to price weakness if investors' appetite wanes include Daytona Beach, Fla.; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Fresno, Calif.; and Orlando, Fla., she wrote.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Today's Market Forecast]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cracks in the Foundation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is no longer whether housing is slowing, but how severe the slowdown is going to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually every major report on the U.S. housing market that has come out in the past month, including yesterday's tally of October existing-home sales from the National Association of Realtors, has come in below economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the dismal scientists get today's report on new-home sales from the Commerce Department right, it will hardly be cheering. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC reckon that sales came in at an annual rate of 1,218,000 last month, down from 1,222,000 in September and a far cry from July's 1,354,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The details of the report will be most revealing. In September, the number of new homes on the market was 20% higher than the year before. If the supply of new homes continues to climb, and sales continue to cool, what had been a sellers' market could turn into a buyers' one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One mark of a buyers' market is price reductions. In September, the median price of a new home came to $215,700 -- just $4,100 higher than the year-earlier figure. New-home prices last month may come in below the October 2004 mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a steep price decline is unlikely. Home builders, like sellers in general, will be slow to lower prices, opting instead to hold on to inventory in hopes of an eventual buyer. Lehman Brothers economists point out that, even when overheated regional real-estate markets run cold, like Los Angeles did in the early 1990s, the price declines play out over years rather than months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that dynamic, 2006 is likely to be a year full of tedious debate over whether housing will have a soft landing or a hard one. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other subject of (tedious) debate will center on how dependent U.S. consumers are on the housing market. Homeowners have extracted a massive amount of equity from their homes in recent years, and the usual rule of thumb is that half this money eventually will get spent on consumer goods and residential investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key word is "eventually." Even as housing prices decline, homeowners will still have cash left over from refinancings and such to spend. It will be a long time before we know whether consumer spending has dodged the real-estate bullet.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONDITIONS HAVE been almost ideal for the housing industry in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage interest rates hit their lowest levels in more than four decades, making it much easier for Americans to buy houses. Many people who were burned in the stock-market bubble of the late 1990s decided that real estate was the best place to stash spare cash. The children of baby boomers began buying their first houses even as their parents started purchasing second homes or speculating on rental units. And American businesses finally began creating jobs again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders couldn't put up houses fast enough to keep up with all this demand. As a result, home prices are up by an average of 53% from five years ago, according to the closely watched index published by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost everyone agrees that prices can't keep rising this fast much longer. The debate now is whether the boom will lead to a soft landing, with gentler price increases, or to a long, painful bust, in which prices fall considerably in some places before buyers regain confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However the current boom ends, longer-term forces are reshaping the housing industry. Here is a look at some of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. SHORT ON SPACE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America still has lots of wide-open spaces, but many of them aren't where people want to live. And builders are finding it more difficult to get permits to put up new houses in many of the more economically vibrant metropolitan areas, particularly along the East and West coasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing supply has been constrained by government regulation as opposed to fundamental geographic limitations," concludes a paper released in December 2004 by Edward L. Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard University, and two colleagues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners share the blame. Prof. Glaeser's paper says they have grown savvier about organizing themselves to block proposals that would bring new and more densely packed housing to their neighborhoods -- something that they fear could reduce the value of existing homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the more crowded markets, home values no longer have much to do with the cost of building a home. In San Francisco, the paper estimates, the structure itself typically accounts for no more than 30% of a home's value; the rest of the value reflects the costs of land and obtaining regulatory approvals to build. That's why some people pay as much as $1 million for an old home, immediately tear it down and build a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. STRAINED BUDGETS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom has enriched many Americans by pushing up the values of their homes. But it hasn't been splendid for everyone. Nearly a third of American households spend more than 30% of their income on housing, and more than one in eight households spend more than 50%, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Others move to distant suburbs so they can pay less for housing, but then must pay high costs to commute. A third of all households in the Boston area are at least 30 miles from the central business district, according to a Harvard study, and about a fifth live 40 or more miles out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people with modest incomes, housing has soared out of reach in some areas. The California Association of Realtors estimates that only 15% of households in that state earn enough to buy a median-priced home, currently costing about $544,000, without spending more than 30% of their income on mortgage payments, real-estate taxes and home insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. A SHRINKING FORECAST</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, homes have been getting steadily bigger. The median size of new single-family homes in 2004 was 2,140 square feet, up from 1,535 square feet in 1975, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some academics and industry people believe more Americans will embrace smaller, more urban homes, to avoid long commutes. James Z. Pugash, chief executive officer of Hearthstone Inc., San Rafael, Calif., which finances housing developments, predicts that American cities will become more like their European counterparts, with more midrise buildings, higher housing costs and fewer square feet per person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a 2004 paper for the Brookings Institution, Arthur C. Nelson, a professor at Virginia Tech, says there are at least tentative signs of growing demand for more "walkable" living environments combining homes, entertainment and offices. He cites as a model Arlington County, Va., near Washington. In 1990, Mr. Nelson writes, the conventional wisdom was that the county was "built out" and lacked space for more residents. Yet the population continues to grow rapidly. Mr. Nelson says the county is encouraging higher-density housing on former industrial sites and near mass-transit stations, while preserving the character of established neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The desire for more urban living -- and speculation that it will grow -- has spawned a boom in condominiums. In the 12 months ended in August, sales of condos and cooperative housing soared 14%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 942,000 units. In the same period, sales of single-family homes rose a more modest 6.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. TAKING A RISK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices have soared, lenders have promoted loans that help people afford houses that otherwise would be beyond their reach. These "affordability" loans hold down monthly payments in the early years but subject borrowers to the prospect of much higher payments later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most popular of these loans are interest-only mortgages, which allow borrowers to avoid paying down any of the principal in the first few years. Another twist is the payment-option loan, giving borrowers a choice of several payment levels each month, including one that is less than the interest due. If the borrower makes that choice, the loan balance increases, something known as negative amortization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders also have reduced the amount of documentation that many borrowers have to provide to verify their income and assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank regulators have started asking questions about all of these practices. The fear is that some borrowers have exaggerated their income or won't be able to meet the higher monthly payments once they come due. Another concern is that affordability loans have artificially pumped up housing prices by allowing people to bid more than they can really afford to pay in the long run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. THE HOME AS PIGGY BANK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The traditional goal of homeowners is to pay off the mortgage -- well before retirement, if possible. For now, many Americans seem to have forgotten that notion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To take advantage of lower interest rates, Americans regularly refinance their loans. In the process of refinancing, they often borrow a bit more -- in effect swapping home equity for cash to spend on other things. Such "cash out" refinances totaled $139 billion in 2004, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. Egged on by lenders, other people take out separate home-equity loans, using their homes as collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I guess this generation believes that real-estate values will go up forever, so there's no need to pay down principal," said Angelo R. Mozilo, chief executive officer of Countrywide Financial Corp., the nation's largest mortgage lender, during a conference call with investors last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This blithe attitude has fueled consumer spending. A recent Federal Reserve study found that borrowing against home values added $600 billion to American consumers' spending power last year, or 7% of personal disposable income, up from 3% in 2000 and 1% in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. FOREIGN FRENZY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proliferation of riskier mortgage loans comes as foreign investors are playing a larger role in financing the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors in Asia and Europe have long been major buyers of debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored providers of mortgage financing. Now they also are buying an increasing amount of mortgage-backed securities, bonds backed by the payments of interest and principal on large pools of mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no reliable figures on the total size of foreign investments in U.S. mortgage securities, because many of the purchases are indirect, made through U.S. entities. But the direction is clear. Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter, estimates that foreign holdings of one type of mortgage bond -- those not guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie -- jumped to $40 billion as of June 30 from $30 billion six months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. REDUCED-RATE REALTORS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet hasn't slashed transaction costs in residential real estate, as it has in such areas as airline reservations. Commissions paid to agents still average more than 5% and sometimes reach 7% or more, according to industry estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers offering various cost-saving alternatives finally seem to be gaining traction. Many small brokers charge a flat fee, generally around $500, for putting a house into a multiple-listing service and providing a limited menu of other services; the consumer then typically offers to pay an additional 2.5% or 3% of the purchase price to any agent who supplies a buyer. Other brokers offer to rebate part of any commissions to the consumer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some traditional brokers are experimenting with their own discount arms, even as they try to preserve the full-commission business by backing state laws that mandate a minimum level of service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are putting heavy pressure on the industry to give new models a chance. For instance, the Justice Department in September sued the National Association of Realtors, alleging that its policy on sharing of listing information discriminates against brokers that mainly use Web sites to engage with their customers. The association denies that claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. THE BIG GET BIGGER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building used to be mostly a local business, and there are still around 80,000 home builders in the country, most of them tiny. But the biggest builders are gobbling up more of the market. This year, the top 10 builders account for about 24% of the market (excluding homes built for customers on land they already own), up from 10% in 1997, says Ara K. Hovnanian, chief executive of Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a large builder based in Red Bank, N.J. Within a decade, he predicts, that share will be more than 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big players have the upper hand partly because they have the financial resources to acquire prime parcels of land. Robert I. Toll, chief executive of Toll Brothers Inc., Horsham, Pa., says he often approves land purchases of $100 million or more, something small builders couldn't contemplate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ivy Zelman, chief housing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, says the big builders already have grabbed the easiest market-share gains in fast-growing metropolitan areas and now increasingly are butting heads with one another. That may make future market-share gains slower and more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. GIMME MORE SHELTER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans have made so much money from their homes that they can't resist buying more real estate. Investment properties and vacation homes accounted for 14% of new mortgages last year, up from 7% in 2000, the Federal Reserve says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of this buying comes from baby boomers seeking retirement homes or people hoping to strike it rich as landlords. While these purchases have helped to feed the recent strength in housing, they also could make the market more volatile. That's because second homes and rental properties, unlike primary residences, can easily be dumped onto the market if their owners lose confidence or fail to find reliable tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. WATCHING THE RANKINGS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.D. Power &amp;Associates, the consulting and research firm best known for its surveys of automobile quality, also quizzes buyers of new homes. The home surveys, which began in 1997, now cover 30 large metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that have done well in the surveys -- such as Pulte Homes Inc. and Centex Corp. -- are trumpeting the results. That's forcing other builders to try harder to score as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem for the industry is that it relies mainly on a continually changing cast of subcontractors to perform tasks like pouring foundations, installing heating ducts and shooting nails into roofing tiles. That makes it hard to ensure that quality standards are always met. Hovnanian Enterprises is experimenting with using its own employees to do more of the tasks in some markets in an effort to improve consistency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, says Bruce Karatz, chief executive of KB Home, the surveys have nudged his company into communicating better with customers, including giving them earlier estimates of when houses will be completed. If KB is more than 30 days late, he says, "many customers will never forgive us."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell sharply in October as builders adjusted to a moderating housing market. The number of new building permits also plummeted last month, suggesting that the cooling will continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, falling jobless claims and increased industrial production offered some encouraging signs, though a survey says manufacturers' confidence in the economy remains shaky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 5.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.01 million. That reversed September's 2.5% gain, which analysts had interpreted as a positive sign that the economy overall would overcome disruptions from the devastating Gulf Coast hurricanes. Building permits, seen by analysts as a reliable gauge of future construction activity, fell 6.7% in October, their sharpest monthly decline in six years, the department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics add to indications that the housing market is slowing. On Wednesday, the National Association of Home Builders said its November Housing Market Index, which measures builder confidence about the construction market, dropped eight points. Factors cited in the sharp decline were falling consumer confidence and rising mortgage rates, the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steadily rising mortgage rates are one reason for the shift, which NAHB Chief Economist David Seiders described as more of a "topping" of the market than a retreat. Mortgage provider Freddie Mac said the nationwide average for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.37%, the 10th successive weekly increase, taking the rate to its highest level in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are facing an inevitable fade of housing demand," Mr. Seiders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, industrial production rose 0.9% in October, regaining much of a 1.5% September decline driven mostly by a strike at Boeing Co. and hurricane-related disruptions to oil and gas drilling, mining, refining and chemical production along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a Bank of America Corp. survey of manufacturing chief financial officers shows a rift between their optimism for their own companies' prospects next year and their cautious view for the manufacturing sector and the overall economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of U.S. home sales is showing further signs of slowing, amid a widening gap between sellers' asking prices and the amount skittish buyers are prepared to offer, according to an industry survey, real-estate brokerage firms and housing economists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates, higher energy costs, widespread talk about the risk of a "bubble" in housing and a surge in the number of homes on the U.S. market are among the factors behind the apparent slowdown. They have combined to make home shoppers more cautious, economists and real-estate brokers say. Buyers are taking their time to look for bargains, while many sellers have put unrealistically high price tags on their homes. That leads to a standoff, causing the number of sales to drop -- a classic ending to a period of unusually rapid house-price increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey conducted last week, real-estate consulting firm Real Trends found that the number of home-purchase contracts signed last month dropped 8% from a year earlier at 48 large U.S. real-estate brokerage firms. Those brokers responded to an email poll sent to 80 brokerage firms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, U.S. home sales remain strong by historical standards, and prices in most of the country are at or near records. But even some of the biggest boosters of housing agree that the market has finally moved out of the boom phase that has raised prices nationwide an average of more than 50% in the past five years and more than doubled home values in many cities. "The air is coming out of the balloons," says David Lereah, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, the nation's leading real-estate trade group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $2 trillion U.S. housing market has been the primary driver of the country's consumer spending in recent years and accounts for about one-third of households' net worth. There hasn't been a sustained drop in housing prices in any major part of the U.S. in a decade or more, and housing has become a vital barometer for the financial, retail and homebuilding industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The [house-buying] frenzy is over," said Steve Murray, president of Real Trends, Littleton, Colorado. Mr. Murray said it may take six to eight months before sellers accept that the market has softened and reduce their asking prices. He said some of the brokers surveyed were surprised at how rapidly the market seemed to be cooling in recent weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe the market has peaked," said Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Because of brisk sales earlier this year, he expects sales of new and previously occupied homes to reach a record 8.3 million in 2005, up 4% from 2004. But he believes sales will decline 3.5% next year, ending a four-year streak of record-setting totals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cooling of the market is likely to be welcomed by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank has worried that home prices have become frothy and banks' mortgage-underwriting standards have slipped. For the past few years, fast-rising home prices have allowed people to borrow more against their home equity, fueling a spending boom. Last month, Fed governor Donald Kohn, citing "some indications that housing markets are cooling off," said this would force consumers, who aren't saving any of their current income, to save more to build wealth, restoring balance to the U.S. economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slowdown in home-price appreciation would probably restrain economic growth and perhaps encourage the Fed to stop raising U.S. interest rates. However, barring a significant decline in prices, the Fed would be unlikely to cut rates to cushion housing. Ben Bernanke, chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and the nominee to succeed Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in February, said last month that "a moderate cooling in the housing market, should one occur, would not be inconsistent with the economy continuing to grow at or near" its long-term trend next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah of the realtors association still expects the housing market to have a soft landing. He predicts that median home prices in the U.S. will rise about 5% in 2006 after leaping 12% this year. In September, the national median stood at $212,000, according to the Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others fear that the slowdown will be more painful, particularly in areas where prices have soared the most. In a report issued earlier this month, analysts at the New York office of Swiss bank UBS AG said the current upswing in home prices has now matched the unusual surge seen in the aftermath of World War II. Because price increases have been unusually swift and prolonged, the report said, "the odds of a soft landing seem smaller than if the cycle had peaked earlier."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey by Real Trends found that last month's decline in the number of home-purchase contracts was a particularly sharp 14% in the U.S. West Coast region. It found declines of 7% in the Northeast and 8% in the Mid-Atlantic states, while the Southeast was down 1.5% and the Southwest showed a 1% increase.  </p>

D'Ausilio, operating partner of Keller Williams CT Realty in Monroe, Conn., points to a 14% rise from a year earlier in the number of homes put on the market in Fairfield County, Conn., also near New York, in the first 10 months of 2005. "There's a newfound sense of urgency among sellers to get out while the getting is good," Mr. D'Ausilio says. He expects prices to fall 5% to 10% in his area over the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maxine Golden of Re/Max Real Estate Services in Newport Beach, Calif., says that in contrast to this spring buyers are shying away from bidding wars. "They don't want to get involved if someone else is interested," she says. "They are taking a wait-and-see attitude even if it's something they want. They think there will be other things on the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey by Real Trends found that last month's decline in home-purchase contracts was particularly sharp in the West Coast region, down 14%. It found declines of 7% in the Northeast and 8% in the Mid-Atlantic states, while the Southeast was down just 1.5% and the Southwest showed a 1% increase. Though the survey is far from definitive, the trend is clear, Mr. Murray says, particularly because the brokers polled have large local market shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more comprehensive look at the market is due Dec. 6, when the National Association of Realtors plans to release its monthly index of pending home sales. The NAR reported earlier this month that the index based on contracts signed in September was up 3.3% from a year earlier. Sales are considered pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction isn't yet complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a definite change" in supply and demand, says Jacelyn Botti, a senior vice president at Weichert Realtors, a big chain based in Morris Plains, N.J. Along much of the East Coast, she says, inventories of homes available for sale have bloated to a supply sufficient to last five to eight months at current sales rates, compared with three or four months a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With sales slowing, condominium developers in San Diego are appealing to buyers with an array of incentives, says Robert Griswold, owner of Griswold Real Estate Management. "The market has definitely turned," says Mr. Griswold, noting that fliers offering condo buyers a car were being handed out at a recent Rolling Stones concert. "When you see that kind of advertising and promotion, they are clearly getting desperate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many sellers of single-family homes are stubborn in resisting price cuts, some are starting to compromise. Ken Baris, president of Jordan Baris Inc., a real-estate brokerage in West Orange, N.J., says he received an email on Friday from a client suggesting that the firm reduce the price on his five-bedroom home to $829,900 from $849,900. The house has been sitting on the market for 90 days. "It was an unsolicited price adjustment," says Mr. Baris. "I haven't seen that in a very long time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, unusually low interest rates and flexible lending standards were helping Americans keep paying more for houses, despite slow growth in personal income. But that's changing. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is about 6.5%, the highest level in more than two years, according to HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J. That's up from about 5.2% in June 2003, which was the lowest in more than four decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of adjustable-rate mortgages also has been rising, and some lenders have become more reluctant to grant loans that allow borrowers to minimize payments in the early years. The rising cost of credit makes it hard for people who already were stretched to buy homes. Mr. Duncan of the Mortgage Bankers expects mortgage rates to continue rising, reaching about 6.75% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan by the end of next year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Kemba J. Dunham and Ruth Simon </div><div>1256 words</div><div>10 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS THE HOUSING market's red-hot sales pace shifts to a slow burn, some home builders and developers are beginning to offer buyers a richer array of incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with rising inventories of unsold homes and reluctant buyers in many markets, a number of builders and developers are ratcheting up their promotional efforts. One developer is offering as much as $10,000 toward closing costs, while a home builder is throwing in golf-club memberships. Some incentives are available to any buyer, while others are tied to the buyer making use of a builder's preferred mortgage lender. Builders also are pitching higher commissions or special bonuses to real-estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other deals are more creative: A Miami developer is offering to buy back its condo-hotel units at a premium after 18 months. Another builder, taking a cue from last summer's auto makers' deals, is offering "employee pricing" discounts in certain markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moves come as Toll Brothers Inc., a luxury-home builder based in Horsham, Pa., this week lowered its forecast for how many houses it expects to sell in 2006. It cited, among other things, softening demand in a number of its markets, including Chicago, Las Vegas, and Washingon, D.C., and certain parts of Northern California, Maryland and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders often use various types of incentives to help sell homes, even during the strong market in recent years. This practice typically picks up late in the year as companies become eager to close sales and get properties off their books before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts say incentives have gotten more generous, as rising mortgage rates and elevated home prices have slowed sales. Traffic to new-home communities is down, waiting lists are disappearing, and inventories are inching up, analysts say. Ivy Zelman, a housing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, says builders' incentives typically work out to be 2% to 3% of the sales price. In some markets, incentives currently are running as high as 5%, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brian Widic, a 34-year-old systems engineer, bought his new home in Leesburg, Va., a year ago from Winchester Homes, Mr. Widic says he felt lucky to receive about 1% of the home's value, or about $10,000, off the closing costs. Now Mr. Widic says he is being bombarded with mailings from various home builders offering a slew of incentives that range from a finished basement to Redskins season tickets. "I would certainly have a little bit more bargaining power today," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A September survey of 488 single-family home builders by the National Association of Home Builders found that 58% were offering nonprice sales incentives, compared with 51% six months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home buyers, you might have to ask if a builder is offering any special deals, as not all builders publicize their offerings. When it comes time to dicker, buyers are likely to have more success if they ask for upgrades rather than for a price cut, says Rhonda Duffy, broker-owner of Duffy Realty in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offers of reduced closing costs or other incentives tied to using the builder's preferred lender should be examined closely and compared with what may be available from other mortgage lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, the number of builders offering incentives is increasing as the market slows, says Larry Murphy, president of SalesTraq, which tracks the Las Vegas housing market. Among the recent offerings: granite countertops, a $30,000 swimming pool and a one-year pass to a local public golf course valued at roughly $3,000. Denver-based MDC Holdings Inc. is offering $7,500 toward closing costs or $20,000 of upgrades on homes priced around $375,000 at one of its Las Vegas divisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waverton Homes, a builder in Portsmouth, Va., recently increased the amount it will pay toward closing costs to $4,000 from $2,500 if buyers in its Estates at Creekside Landing development use the builder's preferred lender and close before year-end. The builder is also offering agents a $1,500 bonus. "There's no question that it has slowed down," says Penny Boyd, the selling agent for the projects, where homes are priced from $433,000 to $530,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are also pitching incentives at real-estate agents. In Phoenix, Los Angeles builder KB Home is paying agents 4% commissions on the entire sales price on homes at certain area developments. KB also is offering home buyers between $1,000 and $2,000 off the closing costs on spec homes priced in the range of $300,000 to $400,000. The catch? Buyers have to finance their homes through Countrywide KB Home Loans, a joint venture between Countrywide Financial Corp. and KB Home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami Beach, The Mitchell Companies recently rolled out a special offer for buyers who purchase condo-hotel units in its Melia Royal Palm project before the sales office opens. The company is offering units at 10% below the list price and then promising to repurchase them for 12% above that price in 18 months. Buyers who want to keep the units must repay the 10% discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Elad Group Florida, a unit of Elad Group Ltd., recently advertised "Sizzling Savings" of up to $10,000 toward closing costs to some buyers who purchase units in its new condominium development in Miramar, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders are reluctant to admit that their current incentives are any different than their typical offerings at this time of year. Any appearance of a decline in home prices or profits can spook investors and send stock prices lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centex Corp., a big Dallas-based builder, announced last month that it was rolling out an "employee pricing" promotion, in which buyers at one Atlanta development will be offered a 5% discount and up to $20,000 in additional incentives on select homes if they financed through the company's mortgage unit. Normally offered to Centex employees, the discounts are being offered to the general public for a limited time. Centex offers similar programs in St. Louis, Port St. Lucie and San Antonio. A Centex spokesman says the incentive program is a limited offer and is not a "big deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte Homes Inc., based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., recently offered a free gas fireplace, free hardwood floors on the main level, free upgraded cabinets and free washer/dryer at one of its Maryland developments. It also offered a choice of free heat for six months, a free 42-inch plasma television set or free window coverings in the amount of $5,000. "I know this is unbelievable, but it is true!" reads one emailed advertisement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sue Ko, a realtor in Arlington, Va., who received the email, says the Pulte offer "was one of the most incentive-heavy ones" she has ever seen. But Jim Zeumer, Pulte's vice president of investor and corporate communications, says it's all smoke and mirrors. "In terms of price, you're getting a plasma TV, but the rest of the `free' listings are all standard in the house," he adds.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lauren Baier Kim </div><div>879 words</div><div>9 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a slowdown in overall housing sales, the market for condominiums remains strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a condominium surpassed that of a single-family home for the first time last year, according to the National Association of Realtors, or NAR. And it appears that this year will be the 10th consecutive record-setting year in terms of rising condo prices and the number of condo sales, with median condo price tags still above those for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the median condo price of $213,600 was up 9% from September 2004, according to the NAR, and condo sales activity was 10% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some observers question whether the boom will last. The supply of condo units has increased at a record pace, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Much of the demand has been supported by speculative buyers rather than occupants, said Chip Brown, senior vice president and co-director of production at CWCapital, a national multifamily and commercial real-estate lender in Needham, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the face of a market that may be peaking, condo buyers should keep the following five tips in mind, especially when looking in a market where prices have risen sharply, such as Miami or San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location is the key factor. Location is likely to be the biggest factor in your condo's resale value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying in a popular neighborhood will help assure a property maintains its value, although sellers might not always reap such big gains. Buyers seeking large payoffs are likely to be better off purchasing in a new or emerging hot market, though that strategy is a bit riskier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying on a waterfront is usually a good bet for retaining value. Even on the water, not all locations are created equal. End units are preferable, because they have more windows, as are units that face the beach (instead of the parking lot) and ones that have outdoor balconies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avoid "white-vanilla boxes." Distinguishing features help when it comes time to sell. Your condo should have at least one quality that will pique interest, agents say. This something special could be a bit of private outdoor space, a view, a garden or a celebrity resident, said Rob Gross, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman in New York -- "whatever gives it a bit of cachet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo buyers' wish lists include granite countertops and high-end kitchen appliances. Stand-alone refrigerator drawers are popular. These can be installed in the kitchen, or in the master bedroom for refreshments. Other in-demand features include hardwood and bamboo floors, large windows and high ceilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular amenities include a 24-hour doorman, a live-in superintendent, bike-storage rooms and an off-lobby refrigerator for grocery deliveries. Some buildings are installing wine rooms in their basements, while others offer pools and recreational centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for name recognition. A brand name may help fetch a premium price. Donald Trump's residential projects, such as Trump International Hotel &amp;Tower hotel-condominium buildings in Chicago, New York and Las Vegas, tend to generate more buyer interest, Mr. Gross said, especially among foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More high-end projects are being built by well-known designers or architects. French designer Philippe Starck is teaming up with developer Jorge Perez to create Icon Brickell, a condominium complex in Miami. Other well-known names who have gotten into the condo act include architects Richard Meier and Michael Grave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If your builder isn't a household name -- and most aren't -- try to make sure that the builder is at least well-known, and reputable, within the local market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weigh old versus new. If you are buying in an older condo complex, make sure that the building and its grounds have been kept in good condition. If your building isn't kept up properly, your unit will likely be less attractive to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When buying a condo as a short-term investment and banking on quick price appreciation, the better bet is to buy a new condo, preferably in an initial offering, says Florence Shapiro, an associate with Prudential Americana Group in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're willing to invest some elbow grease, purchasing a condo that needs work might be the way to go, says Nick Patterson, an agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Chicago, who deals with many first-time condo buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for good management. A good condo association is crucial to maintaining your condo's value. The association will generally cover expenses to insure and maintain the property, so it is important that it is professionally managed and has the funds to make needed repairs. The type of fixes can vary widely, such as fresh interior paint in the common areas and a new roof, so a condo association's reserve funds are important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a good look at the association's budget: It will help determine the services you will receive and the dues you will be charged.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp;Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSTRUCTION on Qualcomm Inc.'s new facility in North Las Vegas is scheduled to begin by the end of this year. The Blueprint column in Wednesday's Property Report incorrectly said construction would begin in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(WSJ Nov. 14, 2005)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(END) </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Growth Shapes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Beyond `Strip'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casinos and hotels in Las Vegas have about $16 billion in development projects planned or under way, many of them along the legendary Strip. While all of the construction will add 23,000 hotel rooms in the region by 2009, along with a small city's worth of shopping, entertainment and condominiums, a subtler though profound change is taking place in the desert beyond the neon lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The draw of plentiful jobs in the casino industry, combined with housing costs that remain slightly more affordable than neighboring California, makes the Las Vegas region the country's fastest-growing major metropolitan area. Its population rose 83% from 1990 to 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the most recent estimate stands at 1.7 million, according to Economy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population boom and a fast-paced economy are transforming every sector of the region's real estate. Higher land prices and record levels of new-home construction are expanding the region's boundaries as developers scramble to accommodate the influx with new malls, offices and schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city is changing from a gaming community into a metropolis," said Richard Lee, vice president of First American Title Co., which provides real estate consulting to the local hotel industry. Though Mr. Lee said he believes casinos will always be a core part of the economy, "the new Las Vegas is not just about casinos."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has experienced some of the region's most astounding growth. The median home price almost doubled in three years to $300,100 in the second quarter from $159,800 in 2002, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's just below the median of $312,600 in the high-cost western U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 120 mid- to high-rise condominium projects are planned in the region, while conversions of rental apartments into condos helped lower the apartment vacancy rate to 4.1% in the third quarter, the lowest in 54 major markets surveyed by Property &amp;Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston-based real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With land prices rising at annual double-digit rates and 80% of the region's land under federal government ownership, home builders are focusing on higher-density projects and are pushing beyond the mountains that ring the valley into former farm towns such as Mesquite and Pahrump, says Monica Caruso, a spokeswoman for the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman, a former criminal-defense lawyer, also is working to revitalize the city's downtown, which he sees as a place where locals can live and work. He says he has gotten tougher on crime and encouraged the revitalization of the older buildings and casinos along Fremont Street, the city's main drag. "People euphemistically called it mature, but it was seedy," Mr. Goodman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also says he hopes to expand downtown's boundaries with a project called Union Park that will include a performing-arts center, an Alzheimer's research clinic and a new city hall on 61 acres of former rail yard just west of the existing downtown. Mr. Goodman's ambitious vision has had some setbacks lately. Long-running negotiations with Related Cos., one of the country's biggest developers, broke off recently, and the city has decided to act as its own developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A booming job market, especially in tourism, construction and services, increased employment by 7.7% in the 12 months ended in June, the fastest growth rate of any major city, according to PPR. Office buildings have also benefited from the job growth, with vacancies declining almost three full percentage points to a below-average 13.6% in the third quarter from the year earlier. Developers are responding. Work is set to begin this year on a 265,000-square-foot downtown office tower near the proposed Union Park project, and Qualcomm Inc. plans to begin construction in 2007 on a facility on 32 acres in North Las Vegas.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Deborah Schoeneman Special to The Wall Street Journal  </div><div>1116 words</div><div>7 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>31</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT THE MERIDIAN, a condominium tower that opened last month on New York's Long Island, the asking price for two-bedroom units on a high floor with beach views is $1.8 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless you are Billy Crystal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actor, who grew up on Long Island, has been offered one of those two-bedrooms for $1.6 million. The offerer: the building's marketing agent, who thinks Mr. Crystal's name would help to sell units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You need to find innovative ways to sell apartments these days," says the agent, Michael Shvo, who has yet to hear back from the actor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have been on the freebie train for years, from gratis designer fashions to restaurant tabs that never materialize. Now, celebrities are on the receiving end of another shopping break the rest of us don't get: a real-estate discount. With an increasing number of luxury condominiums coming onto the market in New York, Las Vegas and Miami, developers in the U.S. are quietly offering price cuts or sweetened deals to famous faces. The practice is an increasingly important marketing tool to attract full-price buyers in the condominium market, a field some investors worry is becoming overbuilt and attracting a disproportionate number of speculators.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The same way every designer wants to dress Nicole or Gwyneth for the Oscars, every developer wants to say someone fabulous bought in the building or even looked at it," says New York broker Michele Kleier of Gumley Haft Kleier Inc. "All of a sudden, the building becomes an `it' project."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is nothing illegal about celebrities getting preferential treatment, of course. But because the apartments involved are so pricey, the deals often are conducted in secret. Unlike typical home buyers, celebrities often purchase apartments in corporate names to avoid having the details published. For the same reason, deals are sometimes structured so that the unit remains in the developer's name. Often, builders won't discuss discounts, fearing they will give the impression their projects aren't selling on their own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrities, too, are reluctant to talk about the perk because it could create an image issue. Mr. Crystal's publicist, for one, confirms the star was offered a discount on a high-floor, two-bedroom unit at the Meridan but declined to comment further.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How do the deals work? Typically, developers and brokers say a celebrity resident accepts a discount in exchange for allowing their name be used to promote the project. Often, that means having a publicist "leak" the A-list name to gossip columns, or trot it out in news releases and on billboards. Having a celebrity neighbor doesn't increase values necessarily, brokers say, but it does get more potential buyers looking at a building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Cipriani Club Residences at 55 Wall St., luxury condos in New York City slated to open next fall, the celebrities who have allowed their names to be attached to the project are the model Naomi Campbell, actor Mickey Rourke and Margherita Missoni, daughter of the Italian knitwear family.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During an industry preview party of the building in September, co-developer Guiseppe Cipriani touted the building's amenities, including a wine cellar, 24-hour concierge service -- and the trio of famous faces as future neighbors. "They are my friends, and they are moving here," he said, as marketing agents handed out promotional brochures. In one photo, Mr. Cipriani is shown holding a cocktail shaker, standing next to Ms. Campbell, who is wearing a low-cut dress. In another, Mr. Rourke is shown smoking with friends; Ms. Missoni is pictured with a man's head cradled in her lap. Ads using some of the images have run in Vanity Fair and the New York Times Magazine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three received a discount in exchange for allowing the use of their photos in the promotions, says Mr. Cipriani, declining to be more specific. Ms. Campbell's publicist, Rob Shuter, says her modeling fee was deducted from the condo cost. He wouldn't say how much was deducted or how much she paid for her unit. Publicists for Mr. Rourke and Ms. Missoni didn't return phone calls seeking comment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While modern-day condo developers have jumped on the celebrity discount as a sales tool, the practice goes back almost 100 years, or more. According to author Steven Gaines, in 1912, developer Douglas Elliman (who started the eponymous New York brokerage firm) gave Nobel Peace Prize winner Elihu Root about 50% off the rent to move into 998 Fifth Ave., one of the city's first fancy apartment buildings. More recently, Donald Trump says he gave Johnny Carson a discount on an apartment in Trump Tower in 1983 "because it was good for the building."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With increasing competition in the luxury-condo market, developers are looking sell their projects as quickly as possible. According to the National Association of Home Buyers, condos account for 35% of all new-home construction in the U.S. this year, up from 20% in 1998. At the same time, condo prices are rising quickly, with the median price reaching a record $221,700 in June, up 14% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, it is the celebrity -- or his representatives -- who approach the developer. Izak Senbahar, who developed 165 Charles St. in New York, says actor Leonardo DiCaprio's broker, Susan-Gilder Hayes, asked to get the star a 20% discount last year on an approximately $5 million condo. According to Mr. Senbahar, the actor visited the building six times. "The message to me was, `You have to give him a 20% discount,' " says Mr. Senbahar. "I said, `I don't think so.' We don't need gimmicks." A spokesman for Mr. DiCaprio declined to comment. Mrs. Hayes declined to comment. Nine of the building's 31 units, which range in price from $5.3 million to $13 million, still are available after a year of being on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, many residents will have more luck seeing their famous neighbors on the big screen than in their buildings. New York real-estate broker Haley Binn recently bought a loft in Tribeca after reading in a gossip column that the actress Meryl Streep bought a penthouse in the building for $8.95 million. (Ms. Streep paid full price, says the developer. A spokesman for Ms. Streep didn't return phone calls.) Says Mrs. Binn: "I'm still waiting to run into her in the elevator."  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Productivity Rises At Fastest Pace In Over a Year</span>
</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs </div><div>433 words</div><div>4 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. productivity grew at the fastest clip in more than a year during the third quarter, signaling steady growth for the economy, and a gauge of inflationary pressure dropped, a Labor Department report showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, business activity in the nonmanufacturing sector is recovering from the hurricanes that devastated the Gulf Coast, while the number of unemployment claims filed last week fell to prehurricane levels. Also, factory orders sank in September, and a measure of future housing demand slipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonfarm business productivity surged at a 4.1% seasonally adjusted annual rate from July through September, the Labor Department said yesterday. The increase, which exceeded economists' expectations, was about twice that of the second quarter's 2.1% rise. The robust growth helped drive down unit labor costs, which fell to a 0.5% annual rate after a 1.8% rise in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If productivity is rising smartly, employers can boost wages without fueling inflation. But many analysts don't predict a sharp rise in wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The labor pool isn't tight enough to do that," said economist Kathleen Camilli, president of Camilli Economics, a New York City economic and financial-services firm. "It's happening selectively in some areas, but by no means is it widespread as it was in the 1990s."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some indicators offer encouraging signs that consumers are still spending. The National Association of Realtors said its index for pending sales of existing homes slipped 0.3% in September to 128.8 -- the second-highest reading on record and 3.3% higher than in September 2004. Several major retailers are reporting that October sales appear solid based on preliminary numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the Institute for Supply Management reported its Nonmanufacturing Business Activity index rebounded to a reading of 60 in October from September's depressed 53.3 reading, which was attributed to the hurricanes. Eleven of 17 industries reported growth during the month, including entertainment, insurance, communication, health services, utilities, construction and wholesale trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for manufactured goods, however, fell in September. Factory orders dropped by 1.7% after a 2.9% increase in August, the Commerce Department said. Demand for durable goods was revised downward to a 2.4% decline. The results surprised analysts who had been encouraged by an ISM report earlier this week showing growth in the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 8,000 to 323,000 last week, near the pre-Hurricane Katrina level, the Labor Department said yesterday. </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Fed Raises Rates, Signals Additional Increases to Come</span>
</div><div class="author">By Greg Ip </div><div>882 words</div><div>2 November 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for a 12th consecutive time, and will probably have to keep raising them until the economy slows, to keep inflation from rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed, as expected, increased its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4% from 3.75%. Its accompanying statement showed optimism on economic growth and concerns about inflation. "Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment," the Fed said yesterday in the statement accompanying its decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of the damage and disruptions caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.8% annual rate in the third quarter, its eighth consecutive quarter at about that pace. That's above what most economists consider the economy's potential growth rate -- that is, what it can produce with existing capital and labor. Moreover, the Fed appears to see that continuing, thanks to relatively low interest rates, robust productivity growth and "planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the Fed warned that, although oil and gasoline prices have fallen from their levels in the immediate aftermath of the storms, the "cumulative rise in energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures." So far, though, "core" inflation -- which excludes food and energy prices -- has "been relatively low" and "longer-term inflation expectations remain contained."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed suggested it will continue to raise rates, albeit at a "measured" pace, which has come to mean a quarter percentage point per meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 10 voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee agreed on yesterday's increase, unlike Sept. 20 when Fed governor Mark Olson dissented, favoring no increase. (There are normally 12 voting members but two governors' seats are vacant.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 12 regional reserve banks agreed to the accompanying increase in the less-important discount rate, charged on short-term Fed loans to commercial banks, to 5% from 4.75%. Many commercial banks raised their prime rate, the benchmark for many business and consumer loans, to 7% from 6.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy running out of spare capacity and showing no signs of slowing, Fed officials have concluded they need to boost rates further than they previously thought to keep higher energy prices from triggering a price-wage spiral. That will likely require the economy to slow down noticeably in the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may happen on its own. There are scattered signs that the housing market is beginning to cool, and high oil prices have eroded consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But without evidence of a slowdown, the Fed is likely to keep raising rates until it induces one. Last month, Fed governor Donald Kohn said that "the economy would still seem poised to expand more quickly than the rate of growth of its sustainable potential unless monetary policy accommodation is removed further."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets expect the Fed to raise the funds rate to 4.25% on Dec. 13 and 4.5% on Jan. 31, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's last day before retirement. Ben Bernanke, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, has been nominated to succeed Mr. Greenspan. Markets see approximately 50% odds Mr. Bernanke will raise the rate at his first meeting, on March 28, to 4.75%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the Fed began raising the funds rate from a 46-year low of 1% in June last year, it has described rates as "accommodative" -- in other words, below some neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Fed watchers had assumed that at some point the Fed would conclude the rate is at neutral and drop "accommodative." Some Fed officials have recently pressed to drop the description.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it now appears the Fed will keep calling the rate accommodative as long as it expects to raise it further, even if it has passed most estimates of neutral, into "restrictive" territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Hooper, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, thinks the Fed has to get the federal funds rate to 5% because the economy is running out of spare capacity, which heightens the risk that companies and workers will be able to boost prices and wages in response to the jump in energy costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation excluding food and energy prices -- the Fed's preferred price index -- was 2% in August and September, near the top of many officials' "comfort range." Mr. Hooper expects inflation to go above that range, forcing the Fed to slow the economy down, to 3% or slower by 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economic reports yesterday, the Institute for Supply Management said its monthly index was at 59.1% for October, down from September's 59.4% and contrary to expectations for a plunge. With the index continuing to exceed 50 -- seen as an indication that the sector is expanding -- and with new orders and employment continuing to show strength in the report, analysts are optimistic about the sector's future. The Commerce Department said total U.S. construction spending rose 0.5% in September for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.12 trillion.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Ruth Simon </div><div>1575 words</div><div>29 October 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME BUYERS ARE finally starting to catch a break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of soaring real-estate prices -- not to mention periodic bidding wars for third-rate properties -- inventories of homes for sale are rising in many parts of the country. As a result, some buyers are regaining long-lost bargaining power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gives buyers in many markets more room than they have had in years to push sellers to sweeten the pot. Buyers are asking for, and often getting, concessions ranging from help in paying their closing costs to money for repairs or redecorating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And sellers in many markets -- including once-hot areas like Phoenix, San Diego and Boston -- are finding that they can no longer just slap a price on their home and expect it to move quickly. Increasingly, they are being advised to set more realistic pricing expectations and to spruce up their property with fresh paint or some new plantings out front to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rhode Island, where active listings are up 43% from a year earlier, some agents are going even further. Broker Ron Phipps recently offered the buyer of a 2,200-square-foot waterfront condo priced at $550,000 a two-year lease on an Audi TT sports car. The buyer applied the $18,000 value of the lease to the purchase price instead -- then bargained with the seller to kick in an additional $7,000 for closing costs and a new air-conditioning system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The re-emergence of tactics like these is notable because it could signal the end of a prolonged seller's market in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are even cutting list prices outright. In Phoenix, where the number of homes on the market has climbed to 17,000 from 5,400 three months ago, "we're now constantly getting emails that prices have been reduced," says Charles McLean, broker-owner of Century 21 Metro Alliance. His advice to sellers: go "all-out" with marketing tactics like open houses. As recently as this summer, that wasn't only unnecessary, it was often impossible -- properties sometimes were selling in as little as 24 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Northern Virginia, Elaine Raabe, the buyer for three stores run by the local Realtors association, says she's having trouble keeping signs that say "price reduced" in stock. For the previous two years, she says, "you couldn't keep an `under contract' sign in the building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, Steve Krescanko of Century 21 Award is advising clients to offer the buyer's broker a 3% commission instead of 2.5%. On a two-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Escondido, Calif., that recently sold for $420,000, the seller combined a 3% payout to the broker with $6,500 toward the buyer's closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, home sales traditionally slow in the fall. And if mortgage rates remain low, sales could bounce back in the spring. New-home construction surged in September, according to the Commerce Department. Sales of existing homes held steady at their second-highest level on record in September, according to the National Association of Realtors, or NAR. (That's partly because of a boost from Katrina refugees buying homes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many "price cuts" right now are actually deceptive: Sellers who overpriced their properties are being forced to roll back expectations -- but they're still getting more than they probably would have for the same property a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, NAR said it expects sales of existing homes to climb 4.8% this year from 2004 to a record 7.1 million. Next year, however, it believes sales will fall 3.5%. NAR expects the median price of an existing home to climb 12% this year, but just 5.3% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, there are indications the market is in transition. Rising oil prices and higher interest rates may finally be taking a toll, amid concerns about an overheated housing market. A recent survey of real-estate agents by Banc of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim found that selling times were rising in 19 of 20 markets. Prices in 13 markets were flat or falling, up from four in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although buyers in many markets have the newfound ability to start asking for concessions such as closing costs or repairs, whether they get them is another matter. It depends in part on the dynamics of the local market -- and the willingness of the seller to face reality. "We have sellers who refuse to acknowledge that the boom pricing is over," says David Lereah, chief economist of NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, it heightens the importance of pricing a home correctly at the outset. Homeowners can no longer look at what their neighbor received and then simply tack on a big premium. Instead, pay attention to recent sales prices of comparable properties and also size up whether the local inventory of homes for sale is rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers can also do other things to stand out, such as offering the broker a higher payout if the property is under agreement by a certain date or offering to pay the buyer's closing costs, one month's mortgage payment -- or even the heating bill, says Pat Rioux, broker-owner of ListForLess.com, a flat-fee multiple-listing placement service in Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every market is feeling the squeeze. In Charlotte, N.C., sales have been "very brisk," says Pat Riley, president of Allen Tate Co. In Seattle, inventories are down almost 19% from a year ago, says J. Lennox Scott, chairman and chief executive of John L. Scott Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in many areas, some of the excesses of the housing boom are fading. In Washington, D.C., the number of home inspections has climbed because buyers no longer feel they have to forgo inspection to get an offer accepted, says Bo Menkiti, president of the Menkiti Group of Keller Williams Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, asking prices are dropping. Crystal Sullivan, an agent with Liz Moore &amp;Associates in Newport News, Va., put a house she owned in Westhaven on the market in late August, priced at $182,900. She sold it six weeks later after offering a $2,500 credit for closing costs and dropping the price to $169,900. "The hurricanes, the gas prices and the war, coupled with the time of year, have really taken its toll on our area," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Fiedorczyk, an investor in the Boston area, put a three-bedroom home on the market in September, priced at $549,000. Since then, he's dropped the price twice, to $499,000, and hired a broker instead of selling it himself. If a buyer doesn't appear before the listing expires in December, Mr. Fiedorczyk plans to pull the house off the market until spring. "It isn't worth another [price] cut," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average number of showings for homes in Massachusetts fell 25% in September, compared to a year earlier, according to Mapass, an appointment-scheduling service for real-estate brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some sellers, the readjustment has been painful. David D'Ausilio, an operating partner with Keller Williams Realty in Fairfield County, Conn., says one of his clients had to drop the price on an eight-year-old Colonial in Monroe three times, to $664,900 from $724,900, before accepting an offer this month. Nine to 12 months ago, the home would have sold for as much as $695,000, says Mr. D'Ausilio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In certain price points, the market has corrected up to 10% already," he says. For the first time in several years, sellers are accepting offers that are contingent on the buyers selling their own home, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Baron, an agent with Prudential Fox &amp;Roach, Realtors in the Philadelphia suburb of Blue Bell, Pa., says that hiring a professional "stager" helped her to quickly sell a home priced at $3 million. For about $4,000, the stager brought in silk flowers, throw pillows, bedding and rental furniture and filled a basement storage area with furniture and boxes of collectibles so that the upstairs rooms looked more spacious. "Now that we're seeing houses staying on the market longer, we're going to do it across the board," Ms. Baron says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pressure on sellers isn't limited to coastal markets that have seen the biggest gains. In Chicago, where prices have risen steadily but not spectacularly, prices have begun to soften for higher-end properties. "A year ago, you never would hear about going back for a price reduction," says Stephen Baird, president of Baird &amp;Warner. "Now you hear it a little bit." To move a full-floor condo with a view of Lake Michigan, his firm cut the price to $2.975 million from $3.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Houston, where inventories are declining, higher energy prices are putting a dent in the sale of existing homes. Prices are down 3% to 5% over the past year or two, says Julius Zatopek III of Re/Max on the Brazos, with homes that were built a decade or more ago taking the biggest hit because they aren't as energy efficient as new construction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. new-home sales rebounded more quickly than expected in September, while sales for the previous two months were revised down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that sales of new single-family homes increased 2.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.222 million. August sales fell 11.6% to a revised annual rate of 1.197 million from the earlier estimated 1.237 million. Economists surveyed by and CNBC had expected September's sales to rise 1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent housing-market indicators have yet to show sustained cooling of the red-hot activity of recent years. Existing-home sales were reported unchanged in September at nearly record levels, and housing construction staged a surprising rebound during the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a home fell to $285,700 in September from a revised $287,500 in August. The median price was $215,700 last month, down from the revised $228,800 in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Thursday that demand for durable goods, or manufactured goods designed to last at least three years, fell 2.1% last month to a seasonally adjusted $207.03 billion. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC had expected a drop of 1%. The decrease marked the second drop in three months and followed a revised 3.8% increase in August, previously reported as a 3.4% gain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key barometer of business spending -- orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft -- fell 1.2% after rising 4% the previous month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent reports had presented a mixed picture of the U.S. factory sector. This month the Institute for Supply Management, a private research group, reported its manufacturing index increased 5.8 points in September to 59.4 -- any reading above 50 signals expansion in activity. But the Federal Reserve reported that industrial output fell in September by the sharpest amount in more than 2 1/2 years, dropping 0.5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for most goods were down in September, with much of the weakness concentrated in transportation- and computer-related wares. Transportation orders, which have been down three of the last four months, fell 4.7% in September, after increasing 0.8% in August. Commercial-plane orders plummeted 41.6%, and orders for military aircraft dropped 3.5%. But demand for motor vehicles and parts rose 4.7% last month. Excluding transportation, orders for other goods fell 1% in September, after rising 5.1% in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, initial jobless claims fell by 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 328,000 in the week that ended Oct. 22, the U.S. Labor Department said. The four-week average also fell, by 10,000 to 366,500, in the range economists associate with an improving labor market.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs and Kemba Dunham </div><div>566 words</div><div>28 October 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. orders for durable goods fell 2.1% in September, as manufacturers were hit with a strike at Boeing Co. and the aftereffects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate reports yesterday showed that initial unemployment-insurance claims fell to 328,000 from 356,000 last week, and that new-home sales rose last month, but not enough to suppress analysts' view that the housing market is cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said yesterday that orders for durable goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $207.03 billion. The second drop in three months reverses the 3.8% jump in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI Chief Economist Daniel J. Meckstroth said, "September was not normal," noting that "a labor strike at Boeing drastically cut aerospace business and . . . Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf Coast."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report shows commercial-aircraft orders plunged 41.6%, while orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, fell 1.2%. By that measure, Mr. Meckstroth suggested, the longer-term trend isn't so bad. "Nondefense capital-goods orders excluding aircraft, a good indicator of equipment investment, grew at a 5.3% annual rate in the third quarter, and is up 8.6% above the same period one year ago," he said. "There is no question that manufacturing growth has decelerated, but there still is underlying strength that will lead to a rebound early next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Bethune, U.S. economist for Global Insight Inc., in Lexington, Mass., also predicted faster growth lies ahead. "Business investment is still expanding at a solid underlying rate," he said. While growth might be damped slightly for the third quarter, "we are optimistic that a resolution of these issues in the next couple of quarters will set the stage for a near-term re-acceleration," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department's report on unemployment benefits showed initial applications fell for the second week in a row. Initial claims fell 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 328,000, while the four-week moving average fell 10,000 to 366,500 -- in the range analysts say indicates an improving labor market. The department estimates 24,000 of last week's new claims were related to the Gulf hurricanes, pushing the total number of storm-related claims to 502,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales in September rose 2.1% over August, with single-family home sales rising to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,222,000, up from August's 1,197,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week several large home builders have reported impressive earnings, including Centex Corp., whose profit rose 59% for the fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30, and Pulte Homes Inc., whose third-quarter profit climbed 46%. Meritage Homes Corp. nearly doubled its third-quarter profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call, Pulte Chief Executive Richard J. Dugas Jr. said the company saw double-digit growth in new-home orders in all three months of the quarter, though July and August were better than September. Even sales of its active-adult homes in the Washington, D.C., Colorado and Midwest markets -- areas that have been experiencing some weakness -- have been faring well. Still, "the euphoria we've seen in the last few years will probably not be there in '06," he predicted. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- High energy costs and the effects of the Gulf Coast hurricanes continue to take their toll, as consumer confidence fell for the second straight month in October. Existing home sales, meanwhile, saw no growth in September, leading some analysts to question continued robust growth in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index dropped to 85 from a revised reading of 87.5 in September, following a decline from 105.5 in August. Analysts track consumer sentiment closely as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. The downward trend, if it continues, could prove worrisome heading into the holiday season when retailers make much of their profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists originally predicted that the Conference Board index, which is based on survey responses of 5,000 U.S. households, would show an upward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household reaction to business and labor-market conditions remains skittish. The Conference Board said in its report that its present-situation index fell to 108.2 from September's 110.4, while the expectations index -- which shows consumers' expectations for conditions in the next six months -- slipped to 69.5 from 72. Overall, the number saying that business conditions are good decreased by two points, while those saying that conditions have worsened increased by the same number.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of respondents who said jobs are harder to get increased, while those saying jobs are plentiful remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors reported sales of previously owned homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.28 million units for September, exceeding analysts' expectations for 7.2 million. The number was unchanged from August. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE FALLOUT FROM devastating storms and high gasoline prices continues to affect the U.S. economy in different ways, as consumer confidence dropped to the weakest level in two years in October, and September home sales were flat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private U.S. research group, said its index of consumer confidence for the current month fell to 85 from a revised 87.5 in September and 105.5 in August.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout from devastating storms and high gasoline prices continues to affect the U.S. economy in different ways, as consumer confidence dropped to the weakest level in two years in October and September home sales were flat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private U.S. research group, said its index of consumer confidence for the current month fell to 85 from a revised 87.5 in September and 105.5 in August. Economists had expected to see the index gain some ground and come in at 88. The October reading was the worst since the 81.7 seen in October 2003. The index is derived from responses seen through Oct. 18.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Much of the decline in confidence over the past two months can be attributed to the recent hurricanes, pump shock [from higher gasoline prices] and a weakening labor market," said Conference Board economist Lynn Franco.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said in its report that its present-situation index fell to 108.2 from September's 110.4, while the expectations index slipped to 69.5 from 72.3.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in expectations suggests that besides higher winter heating bills, consumers may already be thinking about cutting back on Christmas holiday spending, Ms. Franco said. "in order to avoid a blue Christmas, retailers will need to lure shoppers with sales and discounts," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes held steady in September at the second-highest level on record as demand was bolstered by hurricane victims buying homes, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes last month were unchanged from August at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.28 million. The Realtors said sales would have fallen without the increased demand for houses because of the devastation from Hurricane Katrina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September performance was stronger than economists had been forecasting. They had expected sales to decline by 1.2%, reflecting a belief that rising mortgage rates will begin to cool off the booming housing market. The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to 6.1% last week, its highest level in 15 months, from 6.03% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac, the big government-sponsored mortgage-buying company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As mortgage rates crept higher, the recent rapid gains in home prices showed hints of moderating. The median price of an existing home stood at $212,000 in September, up by 13.4% from September 2004 -- but that represented a slight slowing from the 15.6% year-over-year price appreciation recorded in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katrina had a major impact on sales in areas where it hit, the Realtors said. Sales plunged by 85% in New Orleans but were up 150% in nearby Baton Rouge, Louisiana. "The nearby regions picked up a great deal of activity very quickly," said David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah said the outlook for the housing market is mixed going forward, citing anecdotal reports that there is "some air coming of these very hot markets." Nonetheless, the NAR revised upward its existing-home sales forecast for the year. It sees total existing-home sales of 7.10 million this year, up from 6.78 million in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market was unchanged at 4.7 months in September, the NAR said. Sales among the regions were mixed. In the Northeast U.S., sales were up 0.8%, while in the Midwest sales fell 3%. Sales in the South rose 3.7% and the West region saw sales decline 4.1%.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Home Construction Jumps; Fed Report Notes Cooling Signs</span>
</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs </div><div>563 words</div><div>20 October 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New U.S. home construction surged last month, confounding expectations for a cooling in the broader housing market after two consecutive months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Federal Reserve had a note of caution on the housing sector with the release of its so-called beige book, a summary of current economic conditions. The Fed noted that while residential real-estate activity "remained generally strong," reports that demand for homes has lessened "have become somewhat more common."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the Fed said overall economic growth continued in September, with most districts describing "the pace of activity as moderate or gradual." The survey is comprised of information gathered before Oct. 11 from the Fed's 12 regional banks. Along with a drop in oil prices, the beige book was cited as a factor behind yesterday's stock-market rally that lifted the Dow Industrials 128.87 points to 10414.13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said rising mortgage rates and the prospect of overbuilding suggest that a downturn may still loom, though reconstruction of the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast will sustain the boom in that region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 3.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.108 million units, following a revised 1.2% decline in August. The 3.4% monthly jump was the largest since February and lifted housing starts to a level 10.3% higher than in September 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains weren't uniform, however. The South and the Midwest saw construction gains while building in the Northeast and the West remained flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing-construction industry continued to work at full capacity," said Brian Bethune, U.S. economist at Global Insight, an international economic and financial research firm based in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said building-supply prices, which shot up after the Gulf Coast hurricanes, will eventually affect overall housing construction. "Certainly, it is going to put upward pressure on the cost of housing, which is ultimately going to be passed on to the consumer," Mr. Bethune said. New-home prices as a result will probably rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose 2.6% last month to 1.747 million units, the report said. Construction of apartments with two or more units rose 7.8% to 361,000 units; construction of homes with five or more units rose 2.7% to 303,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the latest data available show August new-home sales fell 9.9% to a 1.237 million annual rate, National Association of Realtors analyst Lawrence Yun said home sales "will easily set a new record in 2005." Looking ahead, he cautioned that there has been "a measurable rise in the inventory of unsold new homes that are under construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against the backdrop of mortgage-rate creep, several Fed officials kept up a drumbeat of warnings on inflation, indicating the Fed likely will continue to raise rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless economic growth "slows unexpectedly . . . the risks may be skewed a little toward the upside on inflation," Fed Governor Donald Kohn said at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The economy will likely continue to grow faster than its ability to supply goods and services unless interest rates are raised further, he said. "Measured" rate increases, he said, "should forestall" inflation pressures. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Housing construction in the U.S. unexpectedly climbed in September, and building permits rose to a 32-year high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted 2.108 million annual rate, the highest pace in seven months after back-to-back declines, the U.S. Commerce Department said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Authorizations in September for future building jumped 2.4% to 2.189 million, the highest annual rate since February 1973. Permits had been projected by economists to decline 3.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street expected a 1.7% decline in September housing starts. The unanticipated increase helped carry construction, year over year, 10.3% higher from September 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has consistently been a significant driver of the economy and barring any major upset to the economic picture, there's no reason to expect that to change in the near future," said Bob Walters, chief economist at Quicken Loans in Livonia, Michigan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect reconstruction from Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent Hurricane Rita to give a boost to starts somewhere down the road.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction last month climbed in the storm-wracked South, rising 6.9% to 981,000. Starts also increased in the Midwest, up 1.9% to 368,000, while remaining flat at 198,000 in the Northeast and 561,000 in the West.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Service-Sector Growth Slows As Costs Rise, Orders Slacken</span>
</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs </div><div>587 words</div><div>6 October 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in the service sector slowed considerably in September amid worries about higher costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported its monthly nonmanufacturing index plunged to a reading of 53.3 last month from 65 in August. The growth rate was the slowest since April 2003, reflecting a deceleration in new orders, employment and new import and export orders, combined with higher prices. The report's price index surged 14 points, to 81.4 in September from 67.1 in August, indicating that service companies saw their costs jumping over the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because a reading of 50 or more is considered a sign of economic solvency, the "overall indication is continued economic growth in the nonmanufacturing sector in September, but at a slower rate of increase than in August," said University of Houston-Downtown Prof. Ralph Kauffman, who conducts the monthly survey of more than 370 purchasing and supply executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six of 17 industries reported declining activity in September, including agriculture, entertainment, real estate, business services, finance and banking, and public administration. Eight reported growth, including construction, insurance, mining, insurance, retail trade, utilities, health services and wholesale trade. Mr. Kauffman said the growth in construction is most likely due to post-Katrina reconstruction efforts. The subindexes for three other categories -- transportation, legal and a broad group of other services -- were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-orders index dropped to 56.6 last month, down from 65.8 in August, and employment growth eased to 54.9 from 59.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many industries complained about rising expenses, especially retailers who said "costs are on the rise in almost all sectors due to energy that seems out of control." Others were concerned about the availability and cost of raw materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday's ISM report stands in stark contrast to the organization's cheerier manufacturing report earlier this week. The earlier report indicated the economy would absorb the shock of Hurricane Katrina, and some analysts said they weren't particularly concerned about yesterday's numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The optics are terrible but we are not too concerned about this," said High Frequency Economics economist Ian Shepherdson in a statement. "We doubt the survey tells us much about the future."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're guessing that these businesses have been alarmed by the possible implications of the post-Katrina drop in consumer confidence and the surge in gas prices; both appear to point to a period of softer consumption. But consumer confidence has now bottomed out," Mr. Shepherdson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could change as winter weather -- and the reality of higher heating bills -- sets in. Yesterday, AccuWeather.com predicted a colder-than-average winter, which, combined with higher heating-oil and natural-gas prices, would boost home-heating costs by 50% to 70%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the ISM report showed real-estate activity declining, the National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales hit another record in August. The index increased 4.7% from a year earlier to a record 129.5. The previous record, 128.1, was set in October 2004. The index measures agreements to purchase homes that haven't been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in a sign that the housing market is cooling, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of applications for mortgages for home purchases slipped 1.9% to 473.8 in the week ended Sept. 30. The index is down about 10% since hitting a peak on June 10. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Joi Preciphs </div><div>637 words</div><div>4 October 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American manufacturers, in a pleasant surprise, said business turned up in September despite Hurricane Katrina and the jump in energy prices, a suggestion that the storm didn't do significant damage to the economy outside of the ravaged Gulf Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management reported its monthly index jumped to 59.4% in September from 53.6% in August, a 13-month high. A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing sector is expanding. Many analysts had expected the September reading to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But manufacturing purchasing managers also reported that prices they paid for materials were up, a sign of incipient inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The across-the-board improvement in orders, production, employment, and exports confirm that manufacturing outside the Gulf Coast region was not hurt by the hurricane disruptions," Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI said. "More time is needed, however, to judge whether the September survey fully reflects the impact of production stoppages that occurred in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi as part of a national picture."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Manufacturers' chief economist, David Huether, called the report "a reassuring bolt from the blue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hurricanes, while devastating to those who live in the affected regions, might actually help create jobs, said Nobert Ore, Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s procurement director, who oversees the monthly survey of about 250 purchasing managers. "I suspect as we identify this new demand that comes about from the hurricanes, it might be good for employment," Mr. Ore said. "Obviously the services sector is going to have to compete for labor, as people go down to the region to do construction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM employment measure inched up to 53.1% in September, from 52.6% in August. Its index of new orders leaped to 63.8% in September from 56.4% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen industries reported growth last month, including paper and wood-product manufacturers, electronic components and equipment; chemicals; instruments and photographic equipment; transportation; textiles; and rubber and plastic products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, chemical manufacturers reported "some real challenges in getting raw materials," especially those produced in the Gulf region and others shipped through the port of New Orleans. Suppliers also reported steep price increases, due in part to sustained increases in energy costs. The ISM prices-paid index reached 78% in September, up from 62.5% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although manufacturers have been "very vocal" over the past year about the prices they pay, the lack of comment on the issue in this month's survey possibly reflects manufacturers' realization that circumstances were driving prices, Mr. Ore said. Purchasers were attempting to cover themselves in lieu of supply-chain disruptions, some manufacturers had to move from regular suppliers to spot suppliers to cover their needs, he said. "There's a tendency to pay a little bit more to cover yourself when you have disruptions," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM survey measures the breadth of strength in the manufacturing sector, not the magnitude. The views of a purchasing manager at a small firm count the same as those at a large firm. The report suggests that the hit from Katrina is highly localized, but this Friday's employment report from the Labor Department and subsequent reports on industrial production from the Federal Reserve Board will provide more comprehensive measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported yesterday that construction spending in August increased 0.4%. However, Hurricane Katrina came too late in August for its effects to be reflected in the construction-spending report. September's report, released in November, is expected to give a better picture of reconstruction efforts.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- The U.S. industrial sector issued an upbeat but also worrisome assessment of itself yesterday: While manufacturing expanded strongly in September, shaking off the impact of Hurricane Katrina, prices for raw materials surged, raising the likelihood of higher inflation and interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index advanced to 59.4 in September from 53.6 the month before, marking the industrial sector's 28th consecutive month of growth. It was the highest reading since the gauge hit 59.6 in August 2004 and well above the 54 reading that analysts had expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding; below 50 indicates manufacturing activity is shrinking. The index is compiled from a survey of purchasing executives in industries across the U.S.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But manufacturers reported a sharp jump in prices last month as higher crude-oil costs and transportation problems caused by the hurricanes boosted input costs. The price index rose to 78 in September from 62.5 in August, the institute said. The price index had jumped 14 points the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norbert Ore, chair of the institute's business-survey committee, said September's strength came from expansion in new orders and production, but he also noted the possibility of higher inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While energy prices and the impact from Hurricane Katrina are major concerns, the manufacturing sector has regained significant momentum," Mr. Ore said in a statement accompanying the numbers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that construction spending climbed to a record in August, helped by a renewed boom in housing. Bigger gains are expected in coming months, spurred by the massive rebuilding required in the aftermath of Katrina, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast on Aug. 29, and Hurricane Rita, which struck the coast last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said total August construction spending rose by 0.4%, the biggest increase in three months. It pushed building activity to a high of $1.11 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase didn't include any hurricane-related activity because Katrina didn't strike until late August. But the government said the spending on the rebuilding of homes and businesses in coming months will add to the construction figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Chan, managing director and senior economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio, said the ISM's report reflects "a level of optimism that was not dented as much as one would have expected by Hurricane Katrina."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the growth in new orders, production and employment suggested that many manufacturers are operating as if they believe "the effects of Katrina will be short-lived." And, he said, this makes sense "when you start to realize all the stimulus that's going to take place . . . with the replacement of machinery and equipment and the rebuilding efforts in the Gulf states."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-orders index expanded to 63.8 in September from 56.4 in August. The production index rose to 63.1 from 55.9 the month before. The employment index rose to 53.1 in September from 52.6 in August.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your Sept. 14 editorial "Justice v. Realtors" concedes that Realtors actually do own their work product -- the listing, which is the agreement between a Realtor and a homeowner that describes the manner in which a home will be marketed and sold. The government should not get involved in dictating to Realtors and homeowners how those marketing plans should be implemented. The industry is already extremely open to competition. It establishes a fair price for its services and then markets its products to the competition, sharing 50% or more of its fee to attract buyers. And it voluntarily makes its inventory available to competitors, empowering them to avoid the costs and infrastructure to produce their own inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a Realtor presents herself to a prospective home seller and makes a listing presentation, she does so with a full understanding of the pricing pressures and competitive issues. The typical homeowner will invite listing presentations from multiple competitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Realtors and firms are obviously better than others, and they are able to demand and earn higher fees. Some choose to discount their fees, which may or may not be reflected in their service levels. In the end, the homeowner decides whether the price/value proposition meets his or her needs. Sales associates are almost always independent contractors, and all commission fees are negotiable. A highly efficient marketplace determines what is acceptable. Real estate commissions have been declining for over 10 years, and the national average is 5.1%.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales  </div><div>679 words</div><div>28 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer confidence skidded to a two-year low in September as energy prices soared, and new-home sales fell more than expected in August in a sign the housing market may be cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together -- high energy costs and a potentially cooling housing market -- the reports point to potential troubles for U.S. consumers, who have been squeezed by soaring gasoline prices and who depend increasingly on rising home values to fund their purchases. U.S. consumers have proved resilient to such squeezes in the past, though it remains unclear whether that will be the case this time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index fell to 86.6 in September. That was down sharply from 105.5 in August and marked the lowest level for the confidence reading since October 2003. The index was equal to 100 in 1985.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group attributed most of the drop to Hurricane Katrina, which battered the Gulf Coast, causing hundreds of deaths and widespread property damage, while hindering oil production and refining in that region. It also cited soaring gas prices, which were partly the result of Katrina, and a less-optimistic job outlook.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically, shocks have had a short-term impact on consumer confidence, especially on consumers' expectations," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "Fuel prices remain high, though they have retreated in recent days, and when combined with a weaker job-market outlook, will likely curb both confidence and spending for the short run. As rebuilding efforts take hold and job growth gains momentum, consumers' confidence should rebound and return to more positive levels by year's end or early 2006."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board revised lower its forecast for rising consumer spending to a 1.5% to 2% annual rate for the fourth quarter from an earlier estimate of 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important wild card for consumers is the state of the housing market. Last year, borrowing against the increasing value of homes added $600 billion, or about 500 billion euros, to household spending power, according to research by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. A slowdown in the housing market could sap that source of spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on August sales of new single-family homes suggested a slowdown might be at hand, though the evidence is far from conclusive. Sales of single-family homes decreased 9.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,237,000, the Commerce Department said. However, it is a very volatile figure. July sales rose at a 5.3% annual rate to 1,373,000, a figure revised down from an earlier estimate of a record 1.41 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales still were higher in August. Moreover, the average price of a home rose to $283,400 from a revised $280,000 in July. The median price increased to $220,300 from a revised $215,000 during July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were an estimated 479,000 homes for sale at the end of August, representing 4.7 months of supply at the current sales rate. That was the highest inventory level since June 2000, when there was an inventory of 4.8 months of supply. In July, an estimated 467,000 homes were for sale, an inventory of 4.1 months of supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One market where inventories of all homes for sale have bloated is Boston. MLS Property Information Network Inc., which provides data on homes for sale in most of Massachusetts, says its total inventory was up 37% at 25,582 homes in mid-September from a year earlier. Some sellers have priced their homes unrealistically high, and buyers "are holding out because they think the bubble is going to burst," said Lisa Coates, a real-estate agent at RE/MAX Advantage in Beverly, Massachusetts.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Murray  </div><div>717 words</div><div>28 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Europe</div><div>WSJE</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALAN GREENSPAN THINKS homeowners are powering the U.S. economy. I have a different theory. It's the Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. If you or I sell a house, we have to turn around and buy another one -- paying for moving expenses, closing costs, origination fees, etc. No cause for a spending spree there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real-estate brokers walk away with a neat 5% to 6% of the sale. When I sold my inflated house in Washington last month (in order to purchase an inflated house in Fairfield County, Connecticut), the brokers earned enough money to buy a new Lamborghini. In many parts of the world, I could have built a house with what I paid them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, they worked for their money. On several fine summer Sunday afternoons, they sat around my pool, while my family and I wandered the city, loitering at successive Starbucks. They also devoted great energy and imagination to arguments and schemes devised to persuade us to accept a lower sales price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that, they deserve something. But a Lamborghini?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is remarkable is that in today's economy, this business model survives -- and not just survives, but flourishes, like some hardy breed of insect. Look at what happened to stockbrokers -- a similar breed, who saw their commissions fall from dollars to pennies in the course of three decades. Or take the even more dramatic fate of travel agents, whose commissions on airline travel plummeted from 12% to nothing in just under a decade in the 1990s. In an age when information was scarce, Realtors could claim big commissions, because they controlled the gold -- the information on houses for sale. In an age when information is ubiquitous, it is hard to understand how they continue to rake in such rents. "Technology democratizes information," says Haim Mendelson, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR THOSE WILLING to use it, the Internet has indeed revolutionized the process of buying a house. In Connecticut, we signed up for a service called MLS-Pulse, provided through a local RE/Max agent. Every time a house came on the market that matched our specifications, I automatically received an email with the details. More than once, I was the first person to see a house after it went on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a great service to me, and a breeze for my agent -- who waited for me to call and tell him which houses I wanted to see. Then he called the listing agent, and both showed up to form a phalanx around me as I toured the home -- protecting their respective commissions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a saner world, this new use of technology would result in a different way of doing business and significantly lower commissions. So far, however, that hasn't. Steve DelBianco, who as a venture capitalist helped start erealty.com, says that firm started out offering a one-percentage-point rebate to home buyers. But erealty.com has been bought by Prudential Rand Realty and the discounts have largely disappeared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative absence of discounting has prompted the U.S. Justice Department to investigate whether the National Association of Realtors is using illegal tactics to fend off Internet competition. In a suit filed this month, the department charged the association with policies that obstruct brokers who use Internet-based tools, by allowing other brokers to keep their house listings off such services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers benefit when real-estate brokers are free to compete vigorously by offering innovative services," says J. Bruce McDonald, the deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALAN GREENSPAN THINKS homeowners are powering the U.S. economy. I have a different theory. It's the Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. If you or I sell a house, we have to turn around and buy another one -- paying for moving expenses, closing costs, origination fees, etc. No cause for a spending spree there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real-estate brokers walk away with a neat 5% to 6% of the sale. When I sold my inflated house in Washington last month (in order to purchase an inflated house in Fairfield County, Connecticut), the brokers earned enough money to buy a new Lamborghini. In many parts of the world, I could have built a house with what I paid them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, they worked for their money. On several fine summer Sunday afternoons, they sat around my pool, while my family and I wandered the city like homeless, loitering at successive Starbucks. They also devoted great energy and imagination to arguments and schemes devised to persuade us to accept a lower sales price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that, they deserve something. But a Lamborghini?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is remarkable is that in today's economy, this business model survives -- and not just survives, but flourishes, like some hardy breed of insect. Look at what happened to stockbrokers -- a similar breed, who saw their commissions fall from dollars to pennies over the course of three decades. Or take the even more dramatic fate of travel agents, whose commissions on airline travel plummeted from 12% to nothing in just under a decade in the 1990s. In an age when information was scarce, Realtors could claim big commissions, because they controlled the gold -- the information on houses for sale. In an age when information is ubiquitous, it is hard to understand how they continue to rake in such rents. "Technology democratizes information," says Haim Mendelson, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR THOSE WILLING to use it, the Internet has indeed revolutionized the process of buying a house. In Connecticut, we signed up for a service called MLS-Pulse, provided through a local RE/Max agent. Every time a house came on the market that matched our specifications, I automatically received an email with the details. More than once, I was the first person to see a house after it went on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a great service to me, and a breeze for my agent -- who waited for me to call and tell him which houses I wanted to see. Then he called the listing agent, and both showed up to form a phalanx around me as I toured the home -- protecting their respective commissions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a saner world, this new use of technology would result in a different way of doing business and significantly lower commissions. So far, however, that hasn't. Steve DelBianco, who as a venture capitalist helped start erealty.com, says that firm started out offering a one-percentage-point rebate to home buyers. But erealty.com has been bought by Prudential Rand Realty and the discounts have largely disappeared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative absence of discounting has prompted the U.S. Justice Department to investigate whether the National Association of Realtors is using illegal tactics to fend off Internet competition. In a suit filed this month, the department charged the association with policies that obstruct brokers who use Internet-based tools, by allowing other brokers to keep their house listings off such services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers benefit when real-estate brokers are free to compete vigorously by offering innovative services," says J. Bruce McDonald, the deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION of Realtors disputes the charge, arguing that its policy merely protects the right of brokers and sellers to control whether or not their listings end up on the Internet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Justice Department succeeds or not, the world of real-estate brokers will, eventually, change. Realtors won't disappear. But like travel agents, they will shrink in number and have to find new ways to create value for their clients.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales  </div><div>685 words</div><div>28 September 2005</div><div>The Asian Wall Street Journal</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2005 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer confidence skidded to a two-year low in September as energy prices soared, and new-home sales fell more than expected in August in a sign the housing market may be cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together -- high energy costs and a potentially cooling housing market -- the reports point to potential troubles for consumers, who have been squeezed by soaring gasoline prices and who depend increasingly on rising home values to fund their purchases. U.S. consumers have proved resilient to such squeezes in the past, though it remains unclear whether that will be the case this time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index fell to 86.6 in September. That was down sharply from 105.5 in August and marked the lowest level for the confidence reading since October 2003. The index was equal to 100 in 1985.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group attributed most of the drop to Hurricane Katrina, which battered the Gulf Coast, causing hundreds of deaths and widespread property damage, while hindering oil production and refining in that region. It also cited soaring gas prices, which were partly due to Katrina, and a less-optimistic job outlook.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Historically, shocks have had a short-term impact on consumer confidence, especially on consumers' expectations," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "Fuel prices remain high, though they have retreated in recent days, and when combined with a weaker job-market outlook, will likely curb both confidence and spending for the short run. As rebuilding efforts take hold and job growth gains momentum, consumers' confidence should rebound and return to more positive levels by year end or early 2006."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board revised lower its forecast for consumer spending to a 1.5% to 2% annual rate for the fourth quarter from an earlier estimate of 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important wild card for consumers is the state of the housing market. Last year, borrowing against the increasing value of homes added $600 billion to household spending power, according to research by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. A slowdown in the housing market could sap that source of spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on August sales of new single-family homes suggested that a slowdown might be at hand, though the evidence is far from conclusive. Sales of single-family homes decreased 9.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.237 million, the Commerce Department said. However, it is a very volatile figure. July sales rose at a 5.3% annual rate to 1.373 million, a figure revised down from an earlier estimate of 1.41 million, a record high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales were still higher in August. Moreover, the average price of a home rose to $283,400 from a revised $280,000 in July. The median price increased to $220,300 from a revised $215,000 during July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were an estimated 479,000 homes for sale at the end of August, representing 4.7 months of supply at the current sales rate. That was the highest rate since June 2000, when there was an inventory of 4.8 months of supply. In July, an estimated 467,000 homes were for sale, an inventory of 4.1 months of supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One market where inventories of all homes for sale have bloated is the Boston. MLS Property Information Network Inc., which provides data on homes for sale in most of Massachusetts, says its total inventory was up 37% at 25,582 homes in mid-September from a year earlier. Some sellers have priced their homes unrealistically high, and buyers "are holding out because they think the bubble is going to burst," said Lisa Coates, a real-estate agent at RE/MAX Advantage in Beverly, Massachusetts.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>755 words</div><div>28 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence skidded to a nearly two-year low in September as energy prices soared, and new-home sales fell more than expected in August in a sign the housing market might be cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the reports point to potential troubles for consumers, who have been squeezed by soaring gasoline prices and who depend increasingly on rising home values to fund their purchases. Household spending has proved resilient to shocks in the past, though it remains unclear whether that will be the case this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said its consumer-confidence index fell to 86.6 in September, down sharply from 105.5 in August. That marked the largest decline in confidence since October 1990, when consumer spending was contracting in inflation-adjusted terms. The level of confidence was the lowest since October 2003. The index was equal to 100 in 1985.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private research group attributed the drop to rising gasoline prices and Hurricane Katrina, which battered the Gulf Coast in late August. A softer job market also seemed to be a factor. The percentage of individuals saying jobs were "hard to get" increased to 25.4% from 23.1% in August. It was the highest percentage in that category since last December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Fuel prices remain high, though they have retreated in recent days, and when combined with a weaker job-market outlook, will likely curb both confidence and spending for the short run," Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, said. "As rebuilding efforts take hold and job growth gains momentum, consumers' confidence should rebound and return to more positive levels by year end or early 2006."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confidence isn't always a good predictor of spending patterns. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, consumer confidence plunged but individuals bought cars aggressively. The International Council of Shopping Centers reported its index of chain-store sales inched up 0.1% for the week ending Sept. 24. However, the index hadn't risen in the prior seven weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even luxury retail sales -- which usually are less sensitive to energy-price swings -- suffered in September because of high gas prices, said Michael Niemira, the council's chief economist. "There are lots of worries and few positive signs out there," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has warned that energy prices could pressure sales, though the retailing giant also says it is on track to meet September monthly sales growth of 2% to 4% at stores open more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is an important wild card for consumers. Last year, households supplemented their spending power by borrowing nearly $600 billion against the value of their homes, according to research by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. A housing slowdown could sap that source of spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on August sales of new single-family homes hinted at a slowdown, though the evidence is far from conclusive. Sales of new homes decreased 9.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.237 million, after rising 5.3% the month before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of new homes for sale grew to 479,000 homes in August, from an estimated 467,000 in July, representing 4.7 months of supply at the current sales rate. The rate of inventories was the highest since June 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boston, inventories of homes on the market -- mainly existing homes -- are up 37% from a year earlier, according to MLS Property Information Network Inc. In that market, sellers have set high prices and buyers "are holding out because they think the bubble is going to burst," said Lisa Coates, a real-estate agent at RE/MAX Advantage in Beverly, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, economists and home builders were reluctant to conclude the nation's housing market is cooling. New-home-sales figures are volatile and compared with a year earlier, sales were higher in August. Moreover, the median home price increased to $220,300 from a revised $215,000 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a slowdown, executives at Lennar Corp., a big Miami home builder, don't see it. They announced a record earnings increase of 50% this week. "Orders for the quarter were strong," said Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar. "We didn't see a weakening pattern."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALAN GREENSPAN THINKS homeowners are powering consumer spending. I have an additional culprit: Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think about it. If you or I sell a house, we have to turn around and buy another one -- minus moving expenses, closing costs, origination fees, etc. No cause for a spending spree there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real-estate brokers walk away with, on average, a neat 5% of the sale. When I sold my inflated house in Washington, D.C., last month (in order to purchase an inflated house in Fairfield County, Conn.), the brokers earned enough to build their own house in most parts of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, they do some work for that money. Most people don't sell houses that often in life. Having a trusted professional who can help them price it, prepare it, show it and negotiate multiple offers is certainly of value. For that, real-estate brokers deserve something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 5%? With a report this week showing existing home prices up nearly 16% in the past year, and the median price now at $220,000, that large commission amounts to a rapidly increasing windfall -- even as technology, arguably, should be making Realtors' work easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's remarkable that in today's economy, this classic middleman business model survives -- and not just survives, but flourishes, like a hardy breed of insect. There are more Realtors out there today -- 1.2 million -- than there were a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare that with what happened to stockbrokers, a similar breed who saw their commissions fall from dollars to pennies over the course of three decades. Or look at the even more dramatic fate of travel agents, whose commissions on airline travel plummeted from 12% to nothing between 1995 and 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an age when information was scarce, Realtors could claim big commissions, because they controlled the gold -- the information on houses for sale. But in an age when information is ubiquitous, it's hard to understand how they continue to rake in such fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those willing to use it, the Internet has revolutionized the process of buying a house. In Connecticut, we signed up for a service called MLS-Pulse, provided through a local RE/Max agent. Every time a house came on the market that matched our specifications, I automatically received an email with the details. More than once, I was the first person to see a house after it went on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a great service, and a breeze for my agent, who waited for me to call and tell him which houses I wanted to see. Then he called the listing agent, and both showed up and formed a phalanx as I toured the home -- protecting their respective commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, this dramatic change in technology should not only result in a different way of doing business, but also dramatically lower commissions. So far, however, it hasn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative absence of discounting has prompted the Justice Department to charge that the National Association of Realtors is using illegal tactics to fend off Internet competition by allowing brokers to keep their house listings off such services. "Consumers benefit when real-estate brokers are free to compete vigorously by offering innovative services," says J. Bruce McDonald, the deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Cook, vice president for public affairs for the National Association of Realtors, says the Justice Department's case is based on a rule that no longer exists, and that the department has informed the group it's revising its complaint. "It's kind of difficult to respond until we know what we're responding to," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cook also disputes the notion that the Realtors' business model is obsolete. "There is a major difference between real estate and the other products you mentioned," he says. "Airplane seats are all basically the same. Shares of stock are all basically the same. But houses are all different." That, he says, is why skilled professionals are needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm more inclined to agree with Eric Danziger, chief executive of Internet home seller ZipRealty Inc. "We have an industry that truly has not changed since Dwight Eisenhower was President," he says. "That's principally because people in the industry don't want it to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My guess is that change will come eventually, regardless of the fate of the Justice Department's suit. Realtors won't disappear. But like travel agents, they'll shrink in number and find new ways to create value for their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once that happens, attention can turn to another remaining member of the Overpaid Middleman's Club: Investment bankers.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in the U.S. in August logged the second-highest pace on record, but inventories crept up as homes are taking longer to sell, suggesting that price appreciation could cool by year's end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing-home sales, which include single-family dwellings, townhouses, condominiums and co-ops, increased in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.29 million units. That was up 2% from July, the National Association of Realtors reported. In June, existing-home sales reached a record annual pace of 7.35 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price for all housing types was $220,000 in August, up 15.8% from a year earlier. The median is the figure at which half sold for more and half sold for less.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The demand for housing is very strong" and being fed by low interest rates, a growing population and strong buying among baby boomers and their adult children, said David Lereah, the association's chief economist. The association's August data weren't affected by Hurricane Katrina. The data reflect transactions that were completed in August and generally agreed upon by buyers and sellers in June or July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing inventories at the end of August were up 3.5% from a month earlier to 2.86 million units, which represents a 4.7-month supply at the current sales pace, according to the association. That marks five straight months of climbing inventories since March, when the supply was at four months. In the past, a supply of about six months has meant a "market in balance" between buyers and sellers, the Realtor group said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As inventories climb, home prices should cool and grow at a single-digit rate by the end of this year and into 2006, Mr. Lereah said. Inventories are rising partly because buyers are balking at high prices of expensive homes in markets including San Francisco, Chicago and Baltimore, he added. Slowing price appreciation could benefit the market. "We want to see a soft landing in housing. We don't want to see a bubble burst," Mr. Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, single-family-home sales increased 1.9% to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.35 million units. The median single-family-home price was $219,400 in August, up 16.2% from a year earlier. Existing condo and co-op sales rose 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 942,000 units in August. The median condo price was $226,800, up 14.5% from a year earlier.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Allison Bisbey Colter Dow Jones Newswires </div><div>682 words</div><div>22 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B9A</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As concerns mount that the U.S. housing market may be overheating, home builders are taking steps to limit sales to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buyers who resell homes for quick profit may help drive prices higher, potentially putting more money in a developer's pocket, home builders worry that speculative buying could also have a destabilizing effect on the local property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't want to sell [units], and then when you go to settlement, signs start popping up all over the subdivision -- sale, sale -- that compete with the builder," said Gopal Ahluwalia, vice president of economics at the National Association of Homebuilders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ahluwalia said measures such as sales contracts limiting a buyer's ability to rent or resell a property for a specified period of time are more common for condominium developments, where speculative buying is rife. But some builders are also trying to restrict sales of single-family homes to investors, particularly in markets like Florida and Southern California, where prices have been shooting up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., based in Red Bank, N.J., has had an addendum in place since the beginning of the year for contracts in all 13 states in which it operates stipulating that a buyer can't resell the property for 12 months. "We're trying to build nice communities for families to live in," said Doug Fenichel, a spokesman for the company's K. Hovnanian unit in Edison, N.J. "Our primary customer is someone who's going to purchase a home and live in it." He said so-called property flipping creates turmoil that isn't conducive to that kind of stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how prevalent is speculative buying? According to the National Association of Realtors, the practice is actually declining, at least on a nationwide basis. It says just 3% of all residential-property sales in 2004 were properties that had been held for a year or less. That's down from 6% in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a study released this week by First American Real Estate Solutions, a unit of First American Corp., shows flippers represent a much larger -- and growing -- part of three hot markets: Orange County, Calif., Miami-Dade County, Fla., and Clark County, Nev., which encompasses the city of Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, homes held between six and 12 months accounted for 11% of all residential sales in the first half of this year, up from 8% for all of 2004, according to the study; In Las Vegas, they represented 12% of all sales in the first half, up from approximately 7% in 2004. In some zip codes in these three markets, properties turned over within two years represented nearly half of all residential sales this year and last. The study didn't look at preconstruction flips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Cagan, director of research and analytics at First American Real Estate, said one way home builders try to discourage fast resales is by limiting the number of condo or townhouse units they will sell to a single buyer, since that person probably isn't going to live in more than one property at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cagan notes that builders often construct large developments in several phases, and the last thing they want to see is for-sale signs popping up before a project is completed. "It's not about maintaining a stable community, it's about maximizing their own returns," he says. "They don't want to leave money on the table."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When buyers violate the terms of a purchase contract, home builders may have legal recourse. Mr. Fenichel says that if buyers attempt to flip a property before a sale closes, Hovnanian can terminate the contract and keep the deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when a property is flipped after the sale is completed but before 12 months have elapsed, the company can sue for damages; he said states other than New Jersey allow builders to sue to recover the profit earned on a resale. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Rafael Gerena-Morales </div><div>551 words</div><div>21 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction fell for a second straight month in August as construction of condominiums and apartments tumbled, suggesting that rising concerns about overbuilding in the condo market may have prompted developers to pull back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported yesterday that construction starts of new homes declined 1.3% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.009 million units. In July, starts were down 1.5% to 2.035 million. The government said the effect from Hurricane Katrina was minimal in August because it disrupted construction activity for only the last few days of the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop was attributed exclusively to declines in multifamily housing. Construction starts of single-family homes edged up 0.1% to 1.709 million. Starts of housing with two or more units dropped 8.5% to 300,000 units while construction of homes with five or more units fell 12% to 256,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although statistics for multifamily homes tend to be volatile month to month, economists said the August decline was the second straight drop and the level of starts in August was below the average for the past year. Joel Naroff, chief economist at Commerce Bancorp., said it may be too early to discern a clear trend, but two consecutive months of downward movement may indicate that "builders are starting to throttle back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Homebuilders, said that while the recent declines in multifamily starts could be an "early sign of an oversupply" in the condo market, he cautioned that the declines also could be weather-related since multifamily starts in the South fell sharply last month. "If this is weather-related, these declines will be temporary," Mr. Seiders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the possible slowing in the multifamily market, the single-family-home market remains strong. Some economists say the rebuilding efforts along the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will increase housing starts. Even if certain segments of the housing market cool, the overall "residential housing sector is going to be OK for a while," Mr. Naroff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Secretary John Snow yesterday also dismissed the idea that the overall housing market is in trouble or that there is a bubble in the market. Speaking to credit-union executives in Washington, Mr. Snow said that predictions of a nationwide collapse of the housing market were improbable at best. "There's some easing off going on and that's expected," he said, but added, "I think the bubble is a gross misnomer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported yesterday that permits for future building declined 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.124 million units. In July, permits rose 1.8% -- revised from a previously reported 1.6% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce report showed that residential construction fell 4.1% in the Northeast, 6.6% in the South, and 5.2% in the Midwest; starts climbed 13% in the West. Nationwide, an estimated 184,600 houses were started in August, based on figures unadjusted for seasonal factors. An estimated 199,600 building permits were issued last month, also based on unadjusted figures.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home construction in the U.S. fell for a second consecutive month during August, and permits for future building also declined, suggesting the nation's housing boom might be easing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts declined 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted 2.009 million annual rate, the U.S. Commerce Department said. July starts, originally estimated at 2.042 million, fell 1.5% to 2.035 million from June's 2.065 million rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed permits for future building fell 2.2% in August to a 2.124 million annual rate. Permits rose 1.8% in July to 2.171 million -- revised upward from a previously reported 1.6% increase to 2.167 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government said the effect from Hurricane Katrina was minimal. "The hurricane impacted construction activity only for the last few days of the month," the Commerce Department said. Economists predict expanded home building in Gulf Coast areas ravaged by the storm, but say construction could be drawn out over a long time -- perhaps several years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of sentiment among home builders slipped this month but remained at a favorable level. The National Association of Home Builders' index for sales of new, single-family homes fell to 65 in September from 67 in August, according to a report issued this week. It was at 72 in June. Levels of more than 50 indicate the prevailing view among builders is of a good sales environment.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Chris Mayer and Todd Sinai </div><div>1214 words</div><div>19 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past several years, Chicken Littles have squawked that the sky -- or the ceiling -- is about to fall on the housing market. And it's tempting to believe them. The market sure feels like a bubble: The rampant growth of house prices over the past decade, the rising price of houses relative to rent and the astonishing gap in many cities between price and income are almost unprecedented in recent history. The last time things felt this way, in the late 1980s, real house prices subsequently dropped by one-third in cities like Boston and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet basic economic logic suggests that this apparent evidence of a bubble is anything but. Even in the highest-price cities, housing is, at most, slightly more expensive than average. Here's why: While house prices over the last decade have gone through the roof, the annual cost of owning a house has not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The annual cost of owning, not the price of the house itself, is what homebuyers should (and do) consider when contemplating a purchase. And when comparing the cost of owning with annual rent or annual income -- which is a good way of determining whether house prices are out of whack in relation to the rental market or families' ability to pay -- annual cost is the right measure to use. That cost is simply the net cash outflow required to own a house for a year -- namely, the after-tax cost of financing the purchase price either by borrowing or through the lost risk-adjusted return on the equity tied up in the house, plus carrying costs such as maintenance and economic depreciation -- less the expected appreciation on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We, along with Charles Himmelberg, a research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, computed annual housing costs for 46 housing markets from 1980 to 2004 in a study due to be published this fall in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. Our findings are striking. In none of the hottest housing markets did the ratio of the cost of owning to rent in 2004 exceed the average over the sample period in their own market by more than 13%. The highest was in Portland, Ore. Miami's ratio was 12% above average. But the ratios in the other oft-cited "bubble" cities such as Boston, L.A., New York and San Francisco were no more than 3% above their long-run averages. A similar pattern arises when we compare a city's cost of housing to its mean family income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, in the late '80s, immediately prior to the large house-price declines of the early '90s, the ratio of the annual cost of owning to rent peaked 52% above the long-run average in San Francisco and New York. Boston and L.A. topped out, respectively, at 37% and 42% above the long-run average. Even allowing for growth in house prices during 2005, it is clear that while owning a house is not cheap, it is not inordinately expensive by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland and Miami, and to a degree San Diego, are cities where we have a nascent concern. In those cities, the previous peaks exceeded 2004 levels by just 14 (Portland) to 25 (San Diego) percentage points. Of course, we don't know what ratio of owning to renting costs, or owning costs to income, would precipitate declines in house prices. But in these three cities the ratio of the cost of owning to the cost of renting was higher in 2004 than in at least 17 of the prior 25 years. In almost all other cities, the annual cost of owning in 2004 was no higher than their median values over the previous 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number one reason the current cost of owning differs so much from the price of a house is the historically low level of real, long-term interest rates. Low rates reduce the yearly cost of financing and lessen the cost of tying up capital in the house. At a lower cost-per-dollar of housing, families are willing to spend more for a house, bidding up prices. A further decline in interest rates yields an even greater percentage reduction in the cost of owning because the base cost is already low. This relationship helps explain the increasing growth rates of house prices in the last several years in those cities where new home building is constrained by scarce land and regulation. (Ease of development is why the dislocation caused by Hurricane Katrina should have little lasting effect in many Southern markets around New Orleans, despite the inevitable near-term disruptions. For example, even in the face of strong population growth, Houston and Dallas have seen no real house-price increase over the last 30 years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of that, the priciest U.S. markets are themselves the most sensitive to interest rates. These cities have the highest rates of expected house price appreciation and thus their costs of owning -- which are reduced by capital gains -- are especially low relative to their prices. And a given change in interest rates has a larger percentage effect in those places where the cost of owning is the lowest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the fact that some cities have higher price-to-rent ratios than others does not necessarily make owning there more expensive than renting. For example, the growth rate of house prices in San Francisco has exceeded the national average for more than 60 years, so relatively high financing costs are offset by above-average expected capital gains, reducing the owning cost-to-rent ratio. Indeed, owning a house in San Francisco is like buying a growth stock -- it may have a high price-to-earnings ratio, but no higher a risk-adjusted return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We obviously don't think the sky's the limit for house prices. But when you combine the annual cost concept with recent growth in rents and incomes, today's pricing looks justifiable in most of the U.S. Despite all the talk of a bubble, we find little evidence that house prices are being bid up based on unreasonable expectations of future price growth. While annual costs have risen a bit faster than rents or incomes in the past decade, they started from a historic circa-1995 low in most cities. (A caution: Our study did not consider condominiums or second homes, where new construction is much easier and investors are more prevalent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the same logic that says today's market price of housing is reasonable also implies that house prices are especially sensitive to real, long-term interest rates. In the absence of an offsetting increase in housing demand, an unanticipated rise in real mortgage rates could cause appreciable declines in house prices. For this reason we don't think speculation is justified in the housing market -- gambling on above-average capital gains is simply an interest-rate bet.</p>

</div><div class="author">By James R. Hagerty </div><div>1924 words</div><div>17 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONCE, A HOME was a castle. Now it is looking more like Fort Knox -- a pile of money in need of protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid warnings from economists that real-estate values in some parts of the country may drop eventually, there is a nascent movement to offer new investment products designed partly to hedge against falling property prices. The goal: Offer limited protection against the risk of riding real-estate prices back down again after the record run-up in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, Merrill Lynch &amp;Co. and other investment banks have started offering investment products that will rise in value if a basket of housing-related stocks declines. Already, nearly $400 million of these investments have been sold, according to Daniel Carrigan, vice president for new-product development at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago Mercantile Exchange also is preparing to announce plans to introduce in the second quarter of next year futures contracts based on home prices in each of 10 cities. It will also offer a composite contract covering all 10 cities. That plan follows the introduction last May by HedgeStreet Inc., based in San Mateo, Calif., of financial contracts called Hedgelets that let investors bet on a rise or a fall in home prices in six individual cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strategies like these are far from foolproof, however. Derivative products like these can be complicated and risky, and none of them offers a perfect hedge against the risk that the value of any individual home will fall. But they do provide a new strategy for people worried about an eventual slump in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people who shy away from the complexities of derivatives, there are an array of other options for shielding home equity. These strategies range from the straightforward -- for example, locking in a fixed-rate mortgage while rates are still low -- to riskier approaches, including perhaps becoming a renter for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes are high for homeowners: In the past five years, home prices nationwide have jumped an average of 50%. That has bulked up the net worth of many Americans but also left a much larger proportion of their wealth locked up in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1999, Americans' equity in their homes has soared 68%, to nearly $10 trillion in this year's first quarter, according to Federal Reserve data. During the same time, the value of stocks and mutual-fund shares held by households and nonprofit groups has declined 18% and also equals about $10 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Atkin, a 58-year-old marketing consultant, nine years ago paid about $335,000 for a three-bedroom ranch house in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles. He figures it is now valued at well over $1 million, and has thought about selling his home now while the market is hot and moving to a less-expensive area. One problem, he says: "I wouldn't know where to put all the cash [from the sale] that would earn as good a return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many economists warn that prices in some regions eventually could level off or fall, the housing market has thrown off mixed signals in recent weeks. Inventories of unsold homes are up sharply in some areas, including Boston and the Virginia suburbs of Washington, suggesting that buyers have become more cautious and are taking their time. Another indicator of concern is that houses have become hard for most people to afford in some places. A new study by Carl Haacke, a consultant who was a White House economics aide in the Clinton administration, found that nearly a third of homeowners in Miami, for instance, are paying more than 40% of their incomes in housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the same time, there are optimistic signals. Applications for mortgages by prospective home buyers have rebounded in the past two weeks after slumping on a seasonally adjusted basis during most of the summer. And prices are continuing to rise steeply in much of the country, though that only adds to worries that any eventual decline might be more severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is impossible to protect yourself entirely from the possibility of a decline in home prices, there are strategies for shielding yourself against at least part of the risk. Here is a sampling:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Dabble in derivatives: There are a variety of ways to use the financial markets to provide a limited hedge against a weak housing market. All of them are far from perfect, and most would be too complicated or risky for the average homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the newest twists in this area are the housing-related notes recently offered by Merrill and other investment banks. Merrill's Protected Bear Notes, introduced this past spring, offer a way to bet on a decline over the next eight years in the Philadelphia exchange's Housing Sector index, which is based on the stock prices of 21 companies involved in home building or closely related businesses. The notes will gain in value if that index declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other firms, including Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada, have offered similar notes. ABN Amro Holding NV, the Dutch banking concern, has offered a version of these notes to investors outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While these notes offer a way to profit from a slump in the housing industry, they aren't an ideal hedge. House prices in certain areas could fall or rise based on such factors as the health of the local job market, regardless of how national home builders are performing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is focusing more directly on house prices. It recently reached an agreement to launch housing futures contracts devised by Macro Securities Research LLC, Morristown, N.J. The owners of Macro include a Yale economics professor, Robert J. Shiller, who is known for his gloomy views on the housing market. The futures will be based on indexes of prices in 10 large U.S. metropolitan areas, says Sam Masucci, chief executive of Macro. "We believe there is tremendous interest from people who are interested in hedging home prices," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HedgeStreet, whose Web site is www.hedgestreet.com[http://www.hedgestreet.com] , has a jump on the Chicago Merc. The firm offers its Hedgelets as a way to allow buyers to bet on a rise or a fall in home prices in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the site on a recent day offered the possibility of betting that the median San Diego home price at the end of the current quarter will be either above or below $643,000, compared with about $605,000 in the second quarter, as calculated by the National Association of Realtors. If a client correctly bet $1,000 that the third-quarter price will be lower than $643,000 when it is reported in mid-November, the Hedgelet would be valued at $1,140, or 14% more than the amount invested. However, if the price rose above $643,000, that Hedgelet would be worthless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little trading in these contracts so far. Also, the contracts expire quarterly, so it is impossible to buy a long-term hedge. "It's small but growing steadily," says Russell Andersson, a vice president and co-founder of HedgeStreet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Reiss, a financial consultant in New York, says he has been experimenting with housing Hedgelets and has made some money by betting on a weaker market. Mr. Reiss, who owns a home in Manhattan, says the Hedgelet market is too illiquid to allow any real hedging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Switch to a fixed-rate loan: Over the past few years, more Americans have been taking out adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower rates but expose borrowers to the risk that they will have to pay much higher rates later on. So far this year, around a third of all applications for home loans have involved adjustable rates, though that proportion has been falling in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many financial planners say it is time to ditch those adjustables and lock into long-term fixed-rate loans, taking advantage of fixed rates of around 5.75%, very low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the general level of interest rates goes up, so do payments on adjustable-rate loans. "You kind of put yourself in a vise if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and you see your property value going down while your mortgage payments are going up," says Michael Maloon, a planner in San Ramon, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, adjustable-rate loans are cheaper, at least in the short run, and can make sense for people who know they are going to move within a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Make sure you have cash reserves or a credit line. Financial planners recommend that homeowners make sure they could keep paying their mortgage even if they lose their jobs or suddenly can't work for health reasons. "You need something between you and the equity in your house," says Phil Cook of Cook &amp;Associates in Torrance, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is vital because in a weak housing market you may need lots of time to find a buyer for your home. If you are unable to meet monthly payments, you would have the choice of defaulting (and destroying your credit rating) or slashing the price to fire-sale levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having enough savings would let you keep paying the mortgage while waiting for a buyer. An alternative for those without much savings is to take out a home-equity line of credit now, says Charlie Fitzgerald, a financial planner in Maitland, Fla. That provides a standby loan that could be used temporarily to meet mortgage payments in a pinch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Sell some property. People who own second homes or rental units might consider selling some of them while prices are high. Seok H. Jo, a financial planner in Los Angeles, says some wealthy clients are cashing out of rental properties and second homes, putting the money into municipal bonds or large-cap stocks instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill and Linda Cronin were so worried about the danger of a housing collapse that they recently sold their primary residence in Lake Helen, Fla. -- and moved into a recreational vehicle, which they are using to tour the U.S. Mr. Cronin, 58, a retired management consultant, figures the housing boom "is going to come to a screeching halt eventually."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Cronins have hedged against the risk that house prices will keep rising: They still own a rental home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tactic: If you live in a frothy housing market and expect to move within a year or so, it may be worthwhile to consider selling now and renting for a few months. Last year Dean Baker, a Washington economist who is bearish on U.S. real-estate prices, decided to take profits on the two-bedroom condominium he and his wife owned in Washington's Adams Morgan neighborhood. Having bought the condo for about $160,000 in 1997, Mr. Baker says, they sold it for nearly $450,000 in May 2004. The couple now live in an apartment nearby, costing $2,250 a month in rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since they sold, Mr. Baker concedes, the market value of his old condo probably has gone up even further. But he says he is happy with his decision. "Realistically," he says, "you're not going to be able to pick the exact top" of the market. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by J.D. Power &amp;Associates found that two of the nation's biggest home builders -- Pulte Homes Inc. and Centex Corp. -- are doing the best job of satisfying new-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.D. Power's annual survey of home-buyer satisfaction included 569 builders that operate in 30 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas. The firm said it found that Pulte Homes, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., ranked highest in 16 of these markets, including Detroit, Houston and Orlando, Fla. Dallas-based Centex ranked highest in 10 markets, including Sacramento, Calif., San Diego and Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.D. Power, a Westlake Village, Calif., marketing-information and business unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., said satisfaction with builders has improved over the years. "More builders are realizing that customer satisfaction impacts their bottom line," said Paula Sonkin, an executive director at J.D. Power, which has conducted the survey since 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Dugas, president and chief executive of Pulte, said customer satisfaction is particularly important as the home-building industry consolidates and large builders continue to increase market share. As its name becomes more prominent, Pulte relies on "repeat and referred" customers to buy homes, he explained. In fact, about 45% of Pulte's homes are sold to these customers, nearly triple the percentage of five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.R. Horton Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, the nation's largest builder, didn't fare as well; it was consistently among the lowest-ranked of the large builders. The company was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rankings of KB Home, the Los Angeles builder that has faced public complaints from customers in the past, varied widely. "We did well overall . . . but we also had a few markets that didn't do as well, so you focus on them and make sure you do better next year," says Jeff Mezger, KB Home's chief operating officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the survey, the factors that most drive satisfaction are the warranty and customer service, home readiness and the builder's sales staff. The least important include the location of the home and its recreational facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also includes overall satisfaction index scores by market. Customers were most pleased with builders in Austin, Texas, and Orange County and Sacramento, Calif. They were least impressed with builders in the Jacksonville, Fla., and Philadelphia markets. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Christine Haughney  </div><div>1157 words</div><div>14 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWO WEEKS after Hurricane Katrina destroyed swaths of commercial and residential properties across three states, lenders still don't know how many mortgage holders will default, but pockets of pain in the market for real-estate bonds seems likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At risk are some commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, which are created by pooling together mortgages on buildings such as shopping malls, office towers and hotels, then selling them off as bonds to big investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 3% or so of all commercial mortgage-backed securities nationwide are affected by Hurricane Katrina, but some of the bonds are backed by high-profile properties, like the Hyatt Regency New Orleans and apartment buildings in Mobile, Ala. Across Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama there are about 1,100 properties whose loans are tied to 345 CMBS deals, according to New York analytics firm Trepp LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are specific properties that have larger exposures to New Orleans," says Rob Bloemker, managing director and team leader of the mortgage-backed securities and government group for <span class="companylink">Putnam Investments</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, one office complex called Causeway Plaza in Metairie, La., accounts for 43% of the assets in one security issued in 2000, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>, and Trepp says the Causeway loan may account for even more of the bond. The condition of the complex is unclear, but any uninsured damages or loss of tenants could hurt the value of the bond if investors perceive problems with making payments on the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spreads briefly widened for CMBS since Katrina, and Fitch Ratings analysts predict that the hurricane will hurt the industry's glowing 1% default rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Issuers of commercial mortgage-backed securities are still trying to get a sense of what kind of insurance policies their borrowers have. The National Flood Insurance Program says that commercial-property owners are eligible for as much as $500,000 in insurance for the building and $500,000 for the building's furniture, fixtures and equipment. Beyond that, lenders encourage commercial owners to take out private full-coverage insurance for windstorms and floods. Some hotels affected by Hurricane Katrina had as much as $1 billion in private all-risk insurance, says Gary Thompson, a partner at Gilbert Heintz &amp;Randolph, a Washington, D.C., law firm advising real-estate investment trusts active in the Gulf area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks that issue securities, credit-rating agencies and loan servicers have spent the past two weeks trying to gauge how generous insurers may be to commercial-property owners. Servicers collect monthly payments and manage relations between real-estate borrowers and investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're hearing anecdotally from servicers that there will be many loans which will be underinsured for coverage of flood," says Larry Kay, director of structured-finance ratings for <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>. "We don't know each individual situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding out more will take time -- and legwork: <span class="companylink">GMAC Commercial Mortgage</span>, which services 479 properties valued at $2.8 billion in the affected area, has dedicated 75 staffers to reach borrowers or managers of these properties. GMAC has already reached half of the borrowers -- and half of those say that they still don't know the status of these properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though we've done extensive research, we are dispatching employees to that area," says Mark McCool, GMAC's global servicing senior vice president and managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even without a full property picture, the CMBS market has recovered: Following the hurricane, prices for the highest-quality securities fell slightly and their yields rose a tad relative to blue-chip Treasurys; these bonds are now back to pre-Katrina levels. "Absent some extraordinary new information about New Orleans, the market seems to have adjusted and is moving forward," says <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> senior managing director Randy Reiff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CMBS investors say they are confident about the overall market but they keeping an eye on specific bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other real-estate bonds are less of a concern: The Mortgage Bankers Association estimates that 360,000 residential mortgages on properties on the Gulf coast could be affected: While many of these have likely been packaged into securities, they still account for a small number of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry experts don't expect a rush of residential defaults that would lead to problems with the bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is going to be federal assistance to these people," says Pramila Gupta, senior vice president in the residential mortgage-backed securities group at Moody's Investors Service. "It's really in everyone's interest to get them back to their lives again rather than push them into bankruptcy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury Bonds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A relatively favorable government report on producer prices and technical factors helped lift Treasurys prices. At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year note was up 12/32 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face value, at 100 31/32. Its yield fell to 4.132% from 4.176% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was up 17/32 point at 114 17/32 to yield 4.418%, down from 4.450% Monday. </p>

</div><div class="author">By June Fletcher </div><div>1424 words</div><div>9 September 2005</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>W10</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2005, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR MONTHS, Richard and Sher Pestino have watched real-estate prices in their neighborhood in Loomis, Calif., climb toward, and pass, the $1 million mark. But it was only this week that the couple decided to sell their own four-bedroom house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the deciding factors: A neighbor's home wasn't selling, leading them to believe the market was cooling. Then came a series of confusing economic indicators, and Hurricane Katrina. "We decided it's time to be sensible," says Mrs. Pestino, an office manager for a venture-capital firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who've been trying to pick the right time to sell are grappling with a new set of questions. Over the last two weeks, as Katrina reeled through the south, a less-noticed array of at-times contradictory economic data were also released. On one hand, median prices for existing homes climbed at a record pace, and mortgage rates last week dropped yet again. On the other, according to a report issued Aug. 23, existing-home sales declined in July, the second time this year. Rising oil prices, meanwhile, could result in lower interest rates that would keep the boom going -- or could prompt a recessionary trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimistic view, held by economists such as David Lereah of the National Association of Realtors, argues that housing prices could continue to grow. In July, for example, existing-home prices rose to a record median price of $218,000. In the second quarter of 2005, 24 states and the District of Columbia showed double-digit annual price growth, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. Indeed, Katrina has had the surprising effect of lowering mortgage rates, a development that's likely to keep people buying houses. The bond market has pushed down the long-term rates on which mortages are based, partly because it expects the Federal Reserve to be less aggressive in raising rates despite some jitters about inflation. For the week ending Sept. 2, the average contract rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 5.64%, down from 5.78% two weeks earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the more pessimistic feeling among other economists is that the rapid home-price growth over the last eight years is winding down. In July, existing-home sales dropped 2.6%, while new-home prices in June fell to $219,500, from a record $237,300 in February 2005. As of Aug. 26, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that its index of demand for mortgages used to purchase homes was 470.6, down 11% from the peak of 529.3 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that has prompted Michael Aston to begin researching an asking price for his 80-foot-by-120-foot canal-front lot in Punta Gorda, Fla. The retired businessman worries real-estate prices have climbed too high in the area -- prices overall in the neighborhood have increased almost 30% since June 2005 -- and about future hurricanes. Though he hasn't decided whether to offer the lot now or to wait until January when the "snowbirds" start heading south for their vacations, Mr. Aston says he's committed to selling, because "a nosedive is possible." He's also begun receiving entreaties from brokers: One, the 58-year-old says, offered to cut his 10% commission to 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, economic indicators coupled with the impact of Katrina prompted Robert Campbell to take a different tack. Watching news accounts of the storm, Mr. Campbell, an economist and self-employed investor, became convinced that the post-Katrina landscape included high oil prices that would slow job growth and prompt a recession. In this scenario, he concluded that homeowners would cash out of high-priced areas and move to more affordable ones. After identifying Austin, Texas, as one likely destination, Mr. Campbell began calling fellow investors, looking to raise $3 million to buy raw land in Austin. His plan: Buy up land at $10,000 an acre, spend about $300,000 subdividing it, then sell it for $20,000 an acre to homebuilders. "I think things are ripe for a correction," says Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of worries about Katrina's immediate impact, over the long term, some economists say that high oil prices may well be the factor that puts the brakes on soaring home prices. Since the Gulf of Mexico supplies about one-fourth of U.S. demand for oil, Katrina's devastation has already yielded higher oil prices. That will make it more expensive to produce and transport building-related materials, from windows to drywall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Muddling the picture further: the rebuilding of New Orleans, which will attract construction workers for months or years, and take them away from other parts of the country. That may cut into the supply of new homes that can be built elsewhere, says William C. Young, an economist in Arlington, Va., and as supply shrinks, prices will rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers in the nation's hottest housing markets, the thought that the peak may have passed is sobering. In the suburban Washington, D.C., market, the number of contracts for single-family homes fell 8.9% in July from the year before. Brokers who used to oversee bidding wars of houses that hadn't had a makeover in decades are now pushing sellers to fix up their places to sell faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivian Donahue says she encouraged one client in Falls Church, Va., to spend $6,000 to put in new carpeting and refinish her hardwood floors, to compete with similar homes nearby that had been on the market for weeks. "You wouldn't have had to do this a year ago," she says. Her client's spruced-up house sold in a few days at a little more than its $475,000 asking price; the others are still for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cape Cod, broker Jack Cotton says things have changed since a year ago, when prices were in a "frenzy" and he was advising clients to price their homes at or slightly above the market. Following Katrina, he's expecting a slowdown, at least in the short run, and has started telling sellers to price about 5% below the asking price of comparable homes that have sat on the market for at least a month. "That will create urgency," he says. For sellers who don't want to lower their prices, he's recommending they pull their homes off the market for at least a year, when he expects the national economy to have recovered from Katrina's effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">--- </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"></p><pre class="articlePre">                            Decoding the Data 
 
  Starting two weeks ago, the federal goverment and trade groups released 
seemingly contradictory data on the state of the housing market. Hurricane 
Katrina created more confusion about whether this is a good time to buy or 
sell. There's no simple answer, but here's how economists we contacted 
decoded some of the signs: 
 
  FACT: 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have dropped to 5.64%, the lowest level 
since mid-July. 
  BUY: Y 
  SELL: N 
  REASON: The Federal Reserve may hold off trying to raise interest rates, 
at least temporarily, if Katrina's economic impact curbs inflation fears. 
 
  FACT: Gasoline prices have risen to $3.03 a gallon, from $2.34 a month 
ago; prices will  probably remain high in the near future. 
  BUY: N 
  SELL: Y 
  REASON: Rising prices reduce buyers' purchasing power, and eventually may 
lead to layoffs that shrink the buyer pool. 
 
  FACT: New-home prices fell to $219,500 in June from a record $237,300 in 
February 2005. 
  BUY: Y 
  SELL: N 
  REASON: New home prices may rise again if Katrina rebuilding efforts 
siphon off materials and manpower, constricting supply. 
 
  FACT: Existing-home prices reached a record $218,000 in July. 
  BUY: Y 
  SELL: N 
  REASON: Prices rose at their fastest pace in 25 years earlier this year, 
and could go higher. 
 
  FACT: Existing-home sales dropped 2.6% in July from the month before. 
  BUY: N 
  SELL: Y 
  REASON: It's a sign that the ferocious sales pace of the past year has 
started to cool. 
 
  FACT: The Pending Sales Index, the National Association of Realtors' 
measure of homes that are under contract, dropped 1%, to 125.1, in July. 
  BUY: N 
  SELL: Y 
  REASON: Although the index level is still high, the drop is a sign that 
cooling could continue.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices leapt 13.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the largest gain in 25 years, but the housing market showed signs of cooling in July, two reports released Thursday showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13.4% average price rise, based on an index compiled by the U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, was the biggest recorded since 1979. It compares with average annual increases of about 6% in the past three decades. The index is based on purchase prices and appraisals of home value made during refinancings; stripping out refinancings, the index was up 11% from a year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price increases were concentrated in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona, according to Ofheo. Topping the list were jumps of 36% in Naples-Marco Island, Florida, 34% in Bakersfield, California, and 33% in Merced, California. The Phoenix area, attracting speculators and others priced out of California, was up 30%. Among the weakest markets were Mansfield, Ohio, up 0.4%, and Lafayette, Indiana, up 0.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its pending home-sales index in July declined 1% on a seasonally adjusted basis from June, though it was still up 3.5% from a year earlier. A sale is considered pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has shown other tentative signs of cooling recently. Inventories of unsold homes have been rising in some cities, and houses have been sitting on the market longer. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported earlier this week that its index of demand for mortgages used to purchase homes stood at 470.6 as of Aug. 26, down 11% from a peak of 529.3 on June 10.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the market appears to have lost some of its "frenzy" but remains "very robust," said Lawrence Yun, an economist at the NAR. Dave Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said he believes home sales will begin trending down in the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lowest mortgage rates in more than four decades have allowed Americans to bid more for houses. Most economists long have been predicting that those rates will rise, but there is little sign of that yet. Freddie Mac reported Thursday that its latest weekly survey showed that the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was 5.71%, down from 5.77% a week before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Zelman, chief housing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, noted in a report that 53% of metropolitan areas showed double-digit price appreciation over the past four quarters. "We wonder how much longer the exuberant pricing can continue," she wrote.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices leapt 13.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, the largest gain in 25 years, but the housing market showed signs of cooling in July, two reports released yesterday showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13.4% average price rise, based on an index compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, was the biggest recorded since 1979. It compares with average annual increases of about 6% in the past three decades. The index is based on both purchase prices and appraisals of home value made during refinancings; stripping out refinancings, the index was up 11% from a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price increases were concentrated in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona, according to Ofheo. Topping the list were jumps of 36% in Naples-Marco Island, Fla., 34% in Bakersfield, Calif., and 33% in Merced, Calif. The Phoenix area, attracting speculators and others priced out of California, was up 30%. Among the weakest markets were Mansfield, Ohio, up 0.4%, and Lafayette, Indiana, up 0.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its pending home-sales index in July declined 1% on a seasonally adjusted basis from June, though it was still up 3.5% from a year earlier. A sale is considered pending when a contract has been signed but the transaction hasn't been completed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Incomes among Americans grew at a slower pace in July as their spending surged, and the personal-savings rate dropped to its lowest point on record. A yardstick for inflation fell.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower-than-expected pace in August, amid rising worries over the state of energy prices. A report from the Institute for Supply Management said the group's index of manufacturing activity slipped to 53.6 in August, from 56.6 in July and 53.8 in June. Readings over 50 point to expansion in activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Commerce Department said personal income rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.3%, after climbing an unrevised 0.5% in June. July personal consumption advanced 1%, matching a revised 1% increase the month before. June spending was originally seen up 0.8%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disposable personal income -- income after taxes -- rose 0.3%, following an unrevised 0.5% advance in June. Income after taxes and inflation was flat after rising 0.5% in June. The growth of private-sector wages and salaries sped up in July. Wages and salaries rose $29.4 billion, having climbed $17.9 billion the month before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on durable goods increased 4.7% in July, after rising 4.2% in June. Car sales were strong for a second straight month as motorists seized sharp price discounts by the auto industry. Previously released government data on U.S. retail sales showed demand at car and parts dealers rose 6.7% in July, the biggest increase since a 25.7% advance in October 2001. June sales climbed 4.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Personal savings as a percentage of disposable income was a negative 0.6%. That marked the weakest performance since monthly records began in 1959, the Commerce Department said. The rate was flat in June and was 0.5% in May. Personal savings are tallied by subtracting spending from disposable income; the savings rate, in turn, is savings as a percentage of disposable income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report showed nondurable-goods spending rose 0.6%, after increasing 0.7% in June. July spending on services advanced 0.4%, after a 0.5% increase a month earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A price index for personal-consumption expenditures excluding food and energy rose 0.1% in July from June. The price index increased 1.8% from a year earlier, compared with a year-to-year climb in June of 1.9%. The U.S. Federal Reserve watches the PCE price index closely for signs of growing inflation. The central bank's so-called comfort zone for the gauge ranges from 1% to 2%. Citing "elevated" price pressures in the growing U.S. economy, the Fed raised its key interest rate to a four-year high last month and said it aims to extend the campaign of gradual interest-rate increases it began in mid-2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the ISM manufacturing report, Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee, said, "While not as strong as in July, the PMI still indicates significant economic growth in both manufacturing and the overall economy." But he added, "This month's comments from supply managers indicate great concern over recent new highs in the energy commodities. Many express concerns as to whether current business strength can be sustained if high energy prices persist."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, inflation pressures in the manufacturing sector grew in August. The group said its prices index was 62.5, compared with 48.5 in July. The August reading was the highest since the 71 hit in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, the components of the ISM report were largely positive, although less so relative to the month before. The group said its new-orders index moved to 56.4 from July's 60.6, while the production index hit 55.9, versus 61.2. The pace of hiring among U.S. manufacturers showed a modest slowing, at a reading of 52.6, after 53.2 in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM also said its inventories index for August was 45.7, from July's 47.5.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose an average 13.4% during the 12 months ended June 30, reflecting the largest yearly gain in 25 years, new statistics show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said U.S. house-price growth doesn't look as if it will slow anytime soon. "On the contrary, house-price inflation continues to accelerate as some areas that have experienced relatively slow appreciation are picking up steam," Ofheo Chief Economist Patrick Lawler said in a statement. "There is no evidence here of prices topping out."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, construction spending was flat during July as outlays rose on housing but took the biggest fall in six months for government building of roads, offices and other projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total spending was unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.099 trillion, the Commerce Department said. Spending dropped 0.6% in June; it was originally seen down 0.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July residential-construction spending rose 0.2% to $622.2 billion. Spending decreased 0.2% in June; it was originally seen down 0.4%. Nonresidential-construction spending declined 0.3% in July. Outlays for manufacturing facilities slipped but rose for sewage and waste disposal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private-sector construction outlays increased 0.2% to $856.2 billion. Spending sank 0.6% in June; it was originally seen down 0.2%. Public, or government, construction spending fell 0.8% to $243.2 billion, the biggest drop since January's 1.4% decline. Spending decreased 0.6% in June; it was originally seen falling 0.5%. Federal government construction outlays slipped 0.1%, and state and local spending -- much larger than federal spending in dollars -- fell 0.9% to $226 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims rose 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted level of 320,000 in the week ended Aug. 27, the U.S. Labor Department said. The four-week average climbed to a four-week high of 316,750.  </p>
