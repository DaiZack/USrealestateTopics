<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks stalled after their latest push to record highs, with small losses ending a six-session winning streak for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of a handful of corporate deals provided the only significant driver of activity for traders in an otherwise uneventful session for broad market benchmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> industrials slipped 9.82 points, or 0.1%, to 16937.26. The S&amp;P 500 index eased 0.26 to 1962.61.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had some merger events and some good economic data, but it hasn't been enough to get the market to care," said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at brokerage Robert W. Baird. "We're just kind of treading water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.64 point to 4368.68. It is up 4.6% in 2014. The <span class="companylink">Russell 2000</span> index of small-company stocks declined 0.3%; it is up 1.8% for the year to date at 1184.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As has been in the case for many recent sessions, trading volumes were low. Monday marked the ninth-slowest session of the year, with 5.1 billion shares changing hands, below the year-to-date average of 6.4 billion shares a day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, broad market benchmarks have been confined to small moves. Monday was the 46th consecutive session in which the S&amp;P 500 closed with a move higher or lower of less than a point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the modest moves, the S&amp;P 500 has posted 22 records this year and is up 6.2% for 2014. The <span class="companylink">Dow</span> is up 2.2% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal activity captured much of investors' attention Monday. Shares of <span class="companylink">Micros Systems Inc</span>. rose $2.21, or 3.4%, to $67.98 after The Wall Street Journal reported that <span class="companylink">Oracle Corp</span>. is close to sealing a deal to buy the software company for about $5 billion. <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> edged up 28 cents, or 0.7%, to 41.10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Integrys Energy Group Inc</span>. surged 7.40, or 12.1%, to 68.35 after the company agreed to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Wisconsin Energy Corp</span>. for $5.71 billion in cash and stock. <span class="companylink">Wisconsin Energy</span> shares fell 1.62, or 3.5%, to 45.27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lululemon Athletica Inc</span>. rallied 1.02, or 2.5%, to 41.25 after the Journal reported that the yoga-gear maker's founder, Dennis "Chip" Wilson, is working with bankers at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span>. to find a way to gain more influence over the company's operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Central Garden &amp; Pet Co</span>. climbed 58 cents, or 6.4%, to 9.58 after <span class="companylink">Harbinger Group Inc</span>. said it has offered to buy the company for about $505 million, or $1.1 billion including debt. Harbinger shares rose 15 cents, or 1.2%, to 13.11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management, which manages $5 billion, said he has been encouraged by the recent pickup in merger activity, which is a sign that corporations feel more comfortable putting cash to use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of pent-up demand for companies to deploy cash and put it into a productive asset like a company," Mr. Veru said. He said he has benefited by owning some stocks that have been acquisition targets, and expects the rise in deal making to power the market higher this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the economic news front, existing home sales increased 4.9% in May to a higher than expected annual rate of 4.89 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the government-bond market, the yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note eased slightly to 2.622% from 2.625% late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold futures gained 0.1% to $1318 an ounce, its fourth session in a row of gains. Crude-oil futures fell 0.6% to $106.17 a barrel. The dollar edged higher against the euro but lost some ground against the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, Markit's preliminary June purchasing managers index for the euro zone, which measures activity across both the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 52.8 from 53.5 in May, missing expectations of 53.3.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales of underwater homes have fallen sharply amid the expiration of a key tax break, a situation that could slow the housing recovery and further limits an already thin supply of houses for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sales, where owners sell their homes for a price below the balance on the mortgage, reduce the number of houses that end up in foreclosure. In most cases for the sale to proceed, lenders must approve the purchase and agree to forgive the unpaid portion of the mortgage owed by the homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales had been especially common in recent years in hard-hit states like Florida, Michigan and Nevada, where most homes remain valued at prices that are substantially lower than during the housing boom. In March, about 5% of home purchases nationwide -- some 18,258 -- were short sales, according to mortgage-technology-and-services firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Financial Services</span>. That was down from 6.4% in February and off sharply from the 19.7%, or 51,909, that were short sales in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's drop can be traced in part to the December expiration of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, which Congress originally passed in 2007. Before the act, when a home was sold through a short sale and the lender forgave a portion of the mortgage debt, the seller would typically be required to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven. The act made the forgiven debt tax-free, which paved the way for short sales and helped speed the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a big concern," said Veronica Malolos, a real-estate broker in Kissimmee, Fla. Ms. Malolos said some underwater sellers delisted their properties in January and February after learning that the tax provision wouldn't be extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Malolos's clients Javier and Mayra Gonzalez in Kissimmee said they tried to sell their home last summer after Mr. Gonzalez found a new job but took it off the market in the new year. The couple received offers of about $145,000 on the home, on which they owe about $206,000, including debt from a home-equity line of credit, but their bank wouldn't accept them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the mortgage act wasn't extended, the couple estimate they would owe about $15,000 in additional income taxes based on the $61,000 difference, something they say they couldn't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the couple's bank began foreclosure proceedings on their home, but they said they are working things out with the bank and are staying put, even though Mr. Gonzalez now has a commute of about an hour and 40 minutes each way to his new job in Vero Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales also have tumbled because of rising home prices, which pushed many homes back above water or closer to it. The median existing-home price nationwide was $201,700 in April, 5.2% higher than in April 2013, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> . In the first quarter, about 19% of homes were worth less than their mortgage, according to the real-estate-information website Zillow, down from 31% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With would-be short sellers on the sidelines, the housing market may take longer to work through remaining underwater homes, restricting the already tight home inventory on the market. If some potential short sellers decide to go through a foreclosure instead, that could cause higher losses for mortgage-bond investors, or companies that guarantee payment of mortgages, which tend to recover less in a foreclosure because of the costs of carrying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate Finance Committee in April passed a bill to extend the forgiveness provision, along with many other tax breaks that had expired. But the bill stalled in May after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republicans couldn't agree on how to amend the measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some analysts don't expect Congress to move on a bill until December, after the midterm elections. Any extension would likely come as part of a wider package of tax-break extensions. "This is trapped, and there's little hope of prying it loose," said Jaret Seiberg, financial-policy analyst for <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Securities LLC</span>,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, real-estate agents say sellers are loath to consider short sales on homes, even when facing foreclosure as the alternative. That is a problem not just for troubled homeowners, but also for banks and mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> , which typically lose more money when homes are sold through a foreclosure than through a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are still millions of homes underwater, but short sales have fallen off considerably," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It's gumming up the system" and could be limiting home-buyer activity.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Eric Morath </div><div>580 words</div><div>23 June 2014</div><div>09:10</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously-owned homes rose strongly in May but remain shy of last year's pace, a sign the housing market has tentatively regained its footing this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 4.9% the past month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million homes, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday. The pace was the highest since October, the last month annualized sales topped the five-million mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coupled with an improvement in April, the May figure points to a housing market that has bounced back from a dismal winter and shows buyers are adjusting to modestly higher interest rates compared with the spring of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, May sales were down 5% from the year-earlier level and the recent rebound could be slowed if interest rates on mortgage loans begin to increase, as many economist project. Because of the sluggish start to 2014, the Realtors group expects a 3% reduction in sales this year compared with 2013's total of 5.09 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be risky to assume this gain marks the start of a sustainable rebound," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The recent sales gains are largely "a reversal of the winter hit," and other reports do "not support the idea that demand is recovering," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a strong start last year, the pace of home sales began to ease in August before perking up this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roller coaster coincides with interest rates that jumped a percentage point in the spring of 2013 but have moderated recently, touching a six-month low in May. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 4.17% last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower mortgage rates make home purchases more affordable for borrowers. But Realtors economist Lawrence Yun said he expects rates to start moving back up soon, reaching 5% by the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have edged lower this year even as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> scaled back its bond-buying program designed to push down long-term interest rates. That program is expected to end later this year, and then the Fed will contemplate increasing short-term rates from near zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rate increase, which most Fed officials say will happen next year, likely would put upward pressure on mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed the median sale price for a home in May was up 5.1% from a year earlier to $213,400. That was the slowest annual gain since March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes available for sale rose 6% from a year earlier. At the current pace, it would take 5.6 months to exhaust the supply, just below a typical level. The increased inventory drove May's strong sales pace, said <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight U.S. economist Stephanie Karol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A larger inventory of homes could set up a virtuous cycle where the better selection draws buyers to the market, which sustains price gains, which then entice additional sellers to list. One weak link in that chain, however, could be first-time buyers. The share of first-time buyers fell in May even as sales rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market can only retain its strength for so long if move-up buyers cannot find a first-time buyer to purchase their starter homes," Ms. Karol said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKETS AT A GLANCE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Data as of approximately 5 p.m. ET)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SNAPSHOT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks finished little changed in quiet trading, as investors paused to assess the market's recent gains. Treasurys finished flat to slightly higher on mixed global data. Upbeat Chinese manufacturing data boosted commodity-based currencies against the dollar. Oil futures ended lower as worries about Iraq's oil production eased. Gold settled slightly higher as investors paused after last week's rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPENING CALL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Asian data calendar will remain quiet the next few days now that <span class="companylink">HSBC</span>'s preliminary data on the Chinese manufacturing sector is out of the way. The main event in the region Tuesday is the release of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's second growth strategy package. Despite widespread skepticism from foreign investors, the program Mr. Abe will unveil has the potential to alter Japanese business practices and create new efficiencies in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EQUITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks stalled in their push for fresh record high Monday, as investors paused to assess the market's recent gains and attention shifted to a spate of corporate deal news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of a handful of corporate tie-ups drove buying and selling in select stocks, according to Wall Street trading desks, but overall trading activity was subdued, extending a lull in stock trading that has lingered since early spring. Volume was the ninth lowest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had some merger events and some good economic data, but it hasn't been enough to get the market to care," said Michael Antonelli, an equity sales trader at brokerage Robert W. Baird. "We're just kind of treading water."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors continued to sound an upbeat note on the outlook for stocks. Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management, which manages $5 billion, said he has been encouraged by the recent pickup in merger activity, which is a sign that corporations feel more comfortable putting cash to use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of pent-up demand for companies to deploy cash and put it into a productive asset like a company," Mr. Veru said. He said he has benefited by owning some stocks that have been acquisition targets and expects the rise in deal-making to power the market higher this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were also cheered by an upbeat report on the housing market. Existing home sales increased 4.9% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a rate of 4.75 million for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deal activity captured much of investors' attention. Shares of Micros Systems rose 3.4% after The Wall Street Journal reported that <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> is close to sealing a deal to buy the software company for about $5 billion. Oracle edged up 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Integrys Energy Group</span> surged 12.1% after the company agreed to be acquired by <span class="companylink">Wisconsin Energy Corp</span>. for $5.71 billion in cash and stock. Wisconsin Energy shares fell 3.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Lululemon Athletica</span> rallied 2.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported the yoga-gear maker's founder, Dennis "Chip" Wilson, is working with bankers at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> to find a way to gain more influence over the company's operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Central Garden &amp; Pet</span> climbed 6.4% after <span class="companylink">Harbinger Group</span> said it has offered to buy the company for about $505 million, or $1.1 billion including debt. Harbinger shares rose 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asian trading Monday, markets were mixed as investors assessed upbeat manufacturing data out of China. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.1% on expectations that the data might urge policy makers to hold back on stimulus measures. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.1% to close at a near five-month high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOREX</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commodity-based currencies held onto most gains made against the dollar and the yen after a surprise jump in factory activity for China, the world's second-largest economy, pointed to increased demand for the natural resources produced in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese HSBC preliminary manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed fresh signs of strength in June. The index came in at 50.8, up from 49.4 in May. It was the first time this year that the index showed expansion from the previous month. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Australian and Canadian dollars also benefited from an improved trading backdrop. The conclusion of last week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting removed a degree of risk from the marketplace, said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've gotten the big risk hurdles out of the way last week," Ms. Sutton said. "That has provided a stable backdrop [for carry-trade currencies]. Higher-yielding currencies, like the Australian dollar, have a better outlook, because in the low-volatility environment, they do well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BONDS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds eked out slim gains as softening data out of the euro zone bolstered hopes that major central banks would keep interest rates low to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were kept in check by upbeat reports on the U.S. housing market and China's manufacturing industry. Bond investors also face $107 billion in new <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> debt supply in the next three sessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading was lackluster, which might have exaggerated part of the price swings. About $147 billion worth of Treasury bonds changed hands as of 2 p.m. EDT, said Adrian Miller, a fixed-income strategist at <span class="companylink">GMP Securities</span>, It marks the lowest daily volume in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary June purchasing managers index for the euro zone fell to a six-month low of 52.8. The main weak spot was France, where activity contracted for a second straight month, and at a quickening pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Weak data from Europe support the case that additional measures remain on the table for accommodation, keeping bond yields lower," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of trading in Seattle at <span class="companylink">D.A. Davidson &amp; Co</span>. Geopolitical tensions in Iraq also encouraged some investors to seek safety in Treasury bonds, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMODITIES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil futures slipped as Iraq's oil production continued to be untouched by ongoing violence in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is kind of catching its breath after last week's strong rally," said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn. "Without a supply disruption, I think the majority of the political risk has been priced in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest danger to Iraq's oil production is not that current output will be disrupted, but that continued uncertainty will prompt international oil companies to retreat from Iraq, lowering future production growth, said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this juncture, there's no particular reason for oil prices to move that much higher or that much lower from the gains they've already made," Mr. Tchilinguirian said. "You would need a new event to provoke that kind of change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold prices shuffled between gains and losses, eventually settling slightly higher, as investors tried to gauge how the precious metal will trade after last week's rally.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds eked out slim gains on Monday as softening data out of the euro zone bolstered hopes that major central banks would keep interest rates low to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were kept in check by upbeat reports on the U.S. housing market and China's manufacturing industry. Bond investors also face $107 billion in new U.S. government debt supply in the next three sessions.</p>

It marks the lowest daily volume in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury yield has dropped from 3% at the start of January. Bond prices have been boosted by the uneven pace of global economic growth, geopolitical risk in some developing countries and the record-low interest-rate policies of major central banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary June purchasing managers index for the euro zone—which measures activity across the manufacturing and services sectors—fell to a six-month low of 52.8. The main weak spot was France, where activity contracted for a second straight month, and at a quickening pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Weak data from Europe support the case that additional measures remain on the table for accommodation, keeping bond yields lower," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of trading in Seattle at <span class="companylink">D.A. Davidson &amp; Co</span>. Geopolitical tensions in Iraq also encouraged some investors to seek safety in Treasury bonds, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro-zone data sent bond yields lower broadly in the region. The yield on the 10-year government bond in Spain fell to 2.696% while that on the 10-year government bond in Italy slid to 2.798%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Treasury bonds offer superior yields compared with Germany, the benchmark for the euro zone's sovereign debt markets, enticing investors who are seeking relative value. The 10-year <span class="companylink">German government</span> bond's yield fell to 1.324% Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports out of China and the U.S. offered some optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of China's manufacturing sector hit a seven-month high, which reduced fears about a sharp slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Existing home sales in the U.S. increased 4.9% in May, and the pace was faster than economists forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major central banks have cut interest rates to near zero following the 2008 financial crisis. The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> earlier this month even cut one of its key interest rates below zero, aiming to spur banks to lend to consumers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECB President Mario Draghi suggested earlier in June that the bank hasn't finished stimulating the economy. The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> has called for the ECB to launch a large-scale asset purchase program, including buying of government bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last week the U.S. central bank may keep interest rates low for a considerable period even as debate has grown on signs that inflation is picking up from very low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yellen described recent inflation data as being on the "high side," but she stressed that those figures are "noisy" and that inflation is evolving in line with the central bank's expectations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales of underwater homes have fallen sharply amid the expiration of a key tax break, a situation that could slow the housing recovery and further limits an already thin supply of houses for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sales, where owners sell their homes for a price below the balance on the mortgage, reduce the number of houses that end up in foreclosure. In most cases for the sale to proceed, lenders must approve the purchase and agree to forgive the unpaid portion of the mortgage owed by the homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales had been especially common in recent years in hard-hit states like Florida, Michigan and Nevada, where most homes remain valued at prices that are substantially lower than during the housing boom. In March, about 5% of home purchases nationwide -- some 18,258 -- were short sales, according to mortgage-technology-and-services firm <span class="companylink">Black Knight Financial Services</span>. That was down from 6.4% in February and off sharply from the 19.7%, or 51,909, that were short sales in January 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's drop can be traced in part to the December expiration of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, which Congress originally passed in 2007. Before the act, when a home was sold through a short sale and the lender forgave a portion of the mortgage debt, the seller would typically be required to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven. The act made the forgiven debt tax-free, which paved the way for short sales and helped speed the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a big concern," said Veronica Malolos, a real-estate broker in Kissimmee, Fla. Ms. Malolos said some underwater sellers delisted their properties in January and February after learning that the tax provision wouldn't be extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Malolos's clients Javier and Mayra Gonzalez in Kissimmee said they tried to sell their home last summer after Mr. Gonzalez found a new job but took it off the market in the new year. The couple received offers of about $145,000 on the home, on which they owe about $206,000, including debt from a home-equity line of credit, but their bank wouldn't accept them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the mortgage act wasn't extended, the couple estimate they would owe about $15,000 in additional income taxes based on the $61,000 difference, something they say they couldn't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the couple's bank began foreclosure proceedings on their home, but they said they are working things out with the bank and are staying put, even though Mr. Gonzalez now has a commute of about an hour and 40 minutes each way to his new job in Vero Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales also have tumbled because of rising home prices, which pushed many homes back above water or closer to it. The median existing-home price nationwide was $201,700 in April, 5.2% higher than in April 2013, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> . In the first quarter, about 19% of homes were worth less than their mortgage, according to the real-estate-information website Zillow, down from 31% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With would-be short sellers on the sidelines, the housing market may take longer to work through remaining underwater homes, restricting the already tight home inventory on the market. If some potential short sellers decide to go through a foreclosure instead, that could cause higher losses for mortgage-bond investors, or companies that guarantee payment of mortgages, which tend to recover less in a foreclosure because of the costs of carrying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Senate Finance Committee in April passed a bill to extend the forgiveness provision, along with many other tax breaks that had expired. But the bill stalled in May after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republicans couldn't agree on how to amend the measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some analysts don't expect Congress to move on a bill until December, after the midterm elections. Any extension would likely come as part of a wider package of tax-break extensions. "This is trapped, and there's little hope of prying it loose," said Jaret Seiberg, financial-policy analyst for <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Securities LLC</span>,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, real-estate agents say sellers are loath to consider short sales on homes, even when facing foreclosure as the alternative. That is a problem not just for troubled homeowners, but also for banks and mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> , which typically lose more money when homes are sold through a foreclosure than through a short sale. In the first quarter, for example, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said that in short sales, it recovered 68.4 cents for every dollar of unpaid principal. In foreclosures, Freddie recovered 64.4 cents for every dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are still millions of homes underwater, but short sales have fallen off considerably," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It's gumming up the system" and could be limiting home-buyer activity.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A gauge of new-home construction fell in May after several months of gains, the latest sign of the housing sector's uneven recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 6.5% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.001 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That marked the first decline in four months and was bigger than the 3.7% drop forecast by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was broad-based across regions and type of construction. Single-family housing starts fell 5.9%, while multifamily fell 7.6%. April's surge in home building was revised down slightly to 12.7% growth from 13.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has yet to establish clear upward momentum again," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly approved applications for building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell 6.4% in May to 991,000 on a sharp decline the volatile multifamily segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in one bright spot, single-family permits jumped 3.7% to 619,000, their fastest rate of increase since September 2012. Single-family construction represents the bulk of the housing market and is considered a better gauge of demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a note to clients, economists from <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight described the rise in single-family permits as "one nugget of very good news."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Tuesday's report showed that the road to recovery for the housing industry remains a bumpy one. Home building came roaring back in 2012 and the early part of 2013, only to be derailed by a rise in mortgage rates and a run-up in home prices that sidelined many prospective buyers. Unusually cold weather further depressed housing-market activity over the winter months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some recent data point to strengthening activity. Housing starts grazed postrecession highs in April, while sales data for that month indicate buyers are coming back into the market. April sales of existing homes -- which account for 90% of the market -- rose for the first time this year, while sales of new homes jumped 6.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index, released Monday, rose in June for the first time this year. But it reflected builders' continued concern with a lack of demand for new housing. The index rose to 49, just below the 50 level which indicates more builders generally see conditions as good in the market for new single-family homes than bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAHB chief economist David Crowe said builders perceive potential home buyers to be "still hesitant" and that "builders are reacting accordingly, and are moving cautiously in adding inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's largest Realtors' trade group, meanwhile, says more new homes are needed to increase the supply of homes available for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would help to lower housing prices and put the industry on a healthier growth path. In a recent analysis, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> noted that the rate of job creation -- a proxy for demand -- has far outstripped the pace of home building over the last three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally believe home building will pick up this year from the 930,000 units built last year and make a modest contribution to economic growth. Steady job growth and interest rates that are still low by historical standards should support demand while the pace of home building remains well below historical averages. Since the year 2000, 1.3 million new homes have been built each year on average in the U.S.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Laura Kusisto and Josh Dawsey </div><div>1304 words</div><div>16 June 2014</div><div>20:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventeen months after <span class="companylink">Congress</span> authorized up to $16 billion to fix homes wrecked by superstorm Sandy, tens of thousands of people still are living in damaged houses or paying rent on top of a mortgage as they wait for rebuilding help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 15,000 New York City residents are seeking aid, but city officials say only 352 have so far received a check or city-provided home construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, 2,032 homes are being built or repaired, for more than 11,500 homeowners deemed eligible for rebuilding help, according to the state department of community affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October 2012 storm damaged about 200,000 homes from New Jersey to eastern Long Island, N.Y., while killing 87 people in that region. Three months later, Congress approved the aid, to be distributed by New Jersey, New York state and New York City programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But delivering it has been slowed by a combination of federal rules invoked to prevent fraud and misspending after Hurricane Katrina, local rules, and certain missteps by local officials and contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm still homeless how many months later, and how many billions are sitting in the bank?" said Allison Galdorisi, wondering when work will begin on her battered Staten Island home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waits contrast with vows of quick help. The day after the storm, for instance, President Barack Obama said, "My message to the federal government: No bureaucracy, no red tape."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating that goal have been requirements such as full-scale environmental reviews, taking two to six weeks, for any home rebuilt with federal money. In New York City, with thousands of homes to review, 50 assessors do the first stage of collecting data, and 30 analysts complete the second step of producing reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mandate that low- and moderate-income people get priority helped prompt the city to create a complex, three-tiered system that left some applicants in limbo for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications were further slowed because the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> staff told homeowners to apply for government loans, which are subtracted from any other aid they are approved for. The city hired financial counselors who helped applicants demonstrate they couldn't afford to take on such a loan, and thus qualified for the full amount in grant form—another time-consuming process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEMA said it encourages applying for low-interest loans in certain situations because they are another source of disaster-recovery aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applicants also have complained of lost paperwork and unresponsive staff involving some contractors hired by New York City and New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal money is being distributed in three rounds, each of which requires a state or city government to submit detailed spending plans; these are subject to public review and approval by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>. Only the first round, of about $5 billion, has gone out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for strict rules from HUD, the agency charged with long-term rebuilding after disasters, is that "they all remember very well the Katrina experience," said Jamie Rubin, director of New York state's Sandy recovery program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Katrina, the U.S. waived certain rules and let Louisiana send money to homeowners without requiring them to spend it rebuilding. Thousands took it and never returned. The Sandy relief program has avoided any significant fraud so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York state has been relatively successful at distributing its chunk of federal aid, handing nearly $330 million to about 6,500 of 15,000 eligible homeowners, mostly on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the New Jersey coast and in New York City, help has been harder to come by. Most boardwalks and amusement parks on the Jersey Shore are back, but some neighborhoods just off the beach are filled with boarded-up bungalows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc Ferzan, New Jersey's top recovery official, said "onerous regulations" from Washington make it impossible to distribute money quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state has also been hobbled by its own missteps. In January, it cut ties with a firm managing two rebuilding programs after complaints from applicants and other performance issues. The firm, <span class="companylink">Hammerman &amp; Gainer Inc</span>., has said it met its contractual obligations. It and the state are negotiating a settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey officials also have acknowledged using faulty data that led to improper rejections for some homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, where the waterfront has many blue-collar enclaves of homes passed down through generations, foreclosures are up in storm-hit neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents are leaving by choice, selling homes cheaply or taking advantage of a state buyout program. In communities where most residents agreed to leave, such as Ocean Breeze and Oakwood Beach on Staten Island, the program has offered to purchase more than 500 properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allison Galdorisi and Claire Watson are trying to hold on. Their bungalow in Staten Island's New Dorp Beach neighborhood was inundated. They need $173,000 to repair and elevate the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They applied for aid in June, but their case was held up until November by paperwork issues. In December, they learned they had been placed in the second tier of New York City's three-tier distribution system, behind people with lower incomes whose homes might have been less damaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They don't know when reconstruction will begin and are paying for both a mortgage and a rental home. "I'm going to be using all of my insurance money to pay rent and expenses," said Ms. Galdorisi, a 49-year-old real-estate appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's tier system was created in part because of a focus by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg on preparing for future storms with resiliency projects such as dunes and sea walls. Fearful that this priority would siphon funding from housing, city officials created the tiers to make sure people who most needed housing money got it if there wasn't enough for all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system also helped the city meet a HUD requirement that at least half of its aid go to low- or moderate-income people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some federal officials call the tier system overly complicated. "They spent months trying to pick winners and losers among homeowners," said Rep. Michael Grimm, a Staten Island Republican. "Meanwhile, they weren't giving a dollar to anyone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc La Vorgna, a former press secretary to Mr. Bloomberg, said that among other things, officials were trying to satisfy Republicans who "complained about the risk of fraud and waste after seeing the disasters post-Katrina." Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration said it now is eliminating this priority system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. La Vorgna said right after the storm, workers made emergency heat, power and water repairs that let some 20,000 city families return home. "We directly injected $650 million into the damaged housing stock in 120 days," Mr. La Vorgna said. "The only difference between that lightning-fast program and this one: HUD."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, HUD said its "focus has been on helping families get back into their homes as quickly as possible, spending taxpayers' money wisely, and rebuilding the region to be more resilient." Secretary Shaun Donovan said this month HUD is working with New York City to find ways to cut red tape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio has said at least 500 damaged city homes would be rebuilt and 500 reimbursement checks issued by September. Asked when he expects most homeowners who sought aid to have rebuilt their homes, he declined to say.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Isn't Your Father's American Dream</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many Americans, middle-class success looks like a nice colonial with a lawn, white picket fence and two cars in the driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only was that vision interrupted for millions during the housing crisis, but it may be outmoded. When investors parse economic data to see how close the U.S. economy is to getting "back to normal," they must redefine normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Tuesday's data on housing starts for May. April starts rose by 13.2% from March and jumped back above one million on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis. Starts had only surpassed that one-million mark in November for the first time since the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with delayed activity from a harsh winter less of a factor, starts are seen having cooled slightly to 1.03 million in May, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One million starts is actually a modest level, even in a data series going back to 1959, and low on a population-adjusted basis. For example, rebased to the number of Americans in 1959, starts averaged 1.185 million through 2002 when the housing bubble began to inflate. The three-month average now stands at an adjusted 545,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History provides a cracked lens for anyone trying to gauge how far residential-construction activity will have to climb to revisit glory days. Even in the housing-bubble from 2003 through 2006, activity fell slightly short of the long-run, population-adjusted average. Yet there is little disagreement home builders got ahead of demand then. And today there is less demand than there once was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1960, nearly three-quarters of adults were married, compared with barely half today, and people tied the knot six years younger on average, according to Census Bureau data. Furthermore, the fertility rate in 1960 was 80% higher, resulting in more babies born to a smaller population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is less need for self-standing suburban homes today and more for smaller, cheaper apartments. April's housing data reflect this, with multifamily starts up nearly 40% from a year earlier while single-family ones barely changed. No wonder June confidence figures from single-family home builders, reported Monday, remained in pessimistic territory for a fifth consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American dream just ain't what it used to be.</p>

</div><div class="author">Gabby Warshawer </div><div>893 words</div><div>13 June 2014</div><div>16:47</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After decades marked by blight and lackluster economic growth, Jamaica, the large, south-central Queens neighborhood, was poised to benefit from new zoning rules in 2007, but then the bottom fell out of the real-estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community leaders say development is only now beginning to move forward with new construction. Examples of new work set to begin include an apartment building with 500 units as well as retail space, and a hotel with more than 200 rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood has long benefited from several economic tentpoles, such as courthouses, a college campus and more than a dozen landmark buildings, though they haven't added up to a cohesive whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also benefits from Jamaica Station, a regional transportation hub that serves most <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> lines and has an AirTrain station to John F. Kennedy International Airport, which is just south of the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamaica's boundaries aren't universally agreed upon, but under commonly used borders, it stretches roughly from Hillside Avenue to the north, Linden Boulevard to the south, the Van Wyck Expressway to the west and 191st Street to the east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Settled by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, Jamaica was a center of commerce in Queens until the first half of the 20th century, with banks, department stores and government buildings. The second half of the century was marked by white flight from the Irish-American enclave and the departure of major retailers such as <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>. The majority of residents today are African-American, and there are large numbers of Hispanic and West-Indian immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's old zoning regulations had been in place since the early 1960s. The rezoning covers 368 blocks and allows for larger residential and commercial structures in Jamaica's downtown surrounding the transit hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I wish we had made more progress since 2007, when the zoning allowed it, but it's exciting to envisage what can happen," said Carlisle Towery, president of the nonprofit Greater Jamaica Economic Development Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new apartment-and-retail structure is poised to be "the largest private investment in Jamaica in a long time," said Meredith Marshall, a managing partner with the firm planning the building, BRP Development Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marshall said proximity to the transit hub made the investment especially appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel will also rise in close proximity to the transit hub and have 220 rooms, replacing blighted properties, according to Mr. Towery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Municipal structures include Queens Civil Court and the Queens Borough Public Library's Central Library. CUNY's York College also has a 50-acre campus. City landmarks include the Queens General Court House and Jamaica High School. In addition, there is the Loew's Valencia Theatre, one of five opulent Wonder Theaters opened by the Loew's chain in the New York City area in 1929-30 that is now owned by a church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood had one of the highest foreclosure rates in the city, and the effects of the subprime-lending bust are still being felt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, at the peak of the foreclosure crisis, there were 2,136 notices of foreclosure in the neighborhood, according to statistics from the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. Last year there were 1,662 foreclosure notices in the area. In both 2012 and 2013 the area had the seventh-highest rate of foreclosure notice of all community districts in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home sale price in the neighborhood between March and May of this year was $333,000, according to real-estate website Trulia.com. That was 30% lower than the median price in all of Queens during the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of Jamaica's housing stock consists of one- and two-family homes constructed from the 1920s to the 1960s, with architectural styles such as capes and ranches predominating. It draws many first-time buyers and investors, according to brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Jamaica is one of the most affordable neighborhoods in Queens and it has improved quite a lot over the past 20 to 25 years," said Gregory Scotidas, a broker who has been active in the area for more than two decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parks: The 11-acre Rufus King Park is home to King Manor, an 18th-century Dutch-style house that is a national and city landmark and is run as a museum. The park also has playgrounds and handball courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schools: The neighborhood has a number of public schools, including P.S. 48, an elementary school with more than 400 students that received a B grade from the city in its 2012-13 progress report. I.S. 238, a middle school with an enrollment of around 1,600, received a C from the city in its last progress report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restaurants: Jamaica and Hillside avenues have a variety of ethnic eateries and restaurants, such as Papusa Market, a casual Salvadoran eatery. Margherita Pizza, on Jamaica Avenue, is known for its classic New York slices and pies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shopping: The Jamaica Colosseum Mall on 165th Street has more than 100 stores, many of them discount shops. Jamaica Avenue is the area's main commercial thoroughfare and has national retailers such as <span class="companylink">Old Navy</span> and <span class="companylink">Walgreens</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainment: Jamaica Multiplex Cinemas shows first-run movies.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Keiko Morris   </div><div>677 words</div><div>10 June 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-story building that sits on 25 acres of wooded land in Ossining has served over the decades as a home and training center for Maryknoll missionaries. Now the Roman Catholic religious society is hoping to sell the property to aid its work helping the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We felt if we weren't going to use the property, why not turn it into something more beneficial for the people we serve," said Mike Virgintino, a spokesman for the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until last year, the 43,000-square-foot former convent housed lay missionaries, who are now in a renovated building on the main Maryknoll complex two blocks away. The idea was to incorporate the lay missionaries, who work closely with members of the Maryknoll religious orders, into the main campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 25-acre site, Mr. Virgintino said, the group is open to a variety of options: an outright sale; leasing the building and front section of the property and selling the rear portion; or leasing the property with an option to buy it in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The property on the market is surplus to us," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the value of real estate rises, more nonprofit organizations are likely to sell their land or buildings to pay for activities, said Naomi Levine, executive director of the George H. Heyman Jr. Center for Philanthropy and Fundraising at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. "It's hard to get support," she said. "If you have the property and it's worth a lot of money, now is the time to sell it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the last four months in Manhattan alone, the nonprofit organizations the China Institute in America, the <span class="companylink">Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies</span> and the owners of the United Charities Building have put up for sale long-held buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike some nonprofit groups, the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers aren't struggling financially, Mr. Virgintino said. The organization received generous donations leading up to its centennial celebration in 2011 and has steadily raised money over the past six years. Money earned from the property would help finance Maryknoll work with the poor, which has included a literacy program in Tanzania as well as the renovation and expansion of an eye clinic in South Sudan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first part of the building on the Maryknoll site was built in the 1920s, and the second in the 1950s, said Thomas LaPerch, a broker with the Houlihan Lawrence Commercial Real Estate Group who is marketing the property. The sprawling facility includes 36 dorm rooms, eight apartments, 17 offices, a large dining room, a library and a kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Maryknoll Sisters purchased the property and built a convent on the foundation of a building that burned down in a 1924 fire, Mr. Virgintino said. The convent was their home when not doing mission work in foreign lands, he said. The Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers bought the property from the sisters in 1958.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other orders of Roman Catholic clergy, the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers have experienced a declining membership starting in the 1960s, Mr. Virgintino said. In its heyday -- from 1920 to the mid-1950s -- the organization had 1,500 to 2,000 members at any given time. Today there are 363 Maryknoll priests and brothers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property is zoned for single-family homes on 1-acre lots, but the facility is also suitable for a range of uses -- such as a school -- with a special permit, Mr. LaPerch said. "There is nothing to build on in Westchester County," said Mr. LaPerch. "On the residential side, people are knocking down houses and putting up big houses. There is just no land."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the property has drawn interest from other nonprofit organizations, including private schools, artist groups and a group that works on autism issues, Mr. LaPerch said. His focus is finding a tenant, but he said most interested organizations probably would prefer to buy because they will have to invest money in the buildings.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' wealth hit a fresh record in the first quarter amid a rise in home values and stock prices, a trajectory poised to continue as U.S. markets push higher but one that doesn't necessarily figure to rev up the sluggish recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net worth of U.S. households and nonprofit organizations -- the value of homes, stocks and other assets minus debts and other liabilities -- rose roughly 2%, or about $1.5 trillion, between January and March to $81.8 trillion, the highest on record, according to a report by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> released Thursday. The figures aren't adjusted for inflation or population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are hoping improvements in household balance sheets could help propel an economy that wobbled early this year when an unusually harsh winter took a bite out of growth. Recent reports on trade and the housing market have raised doubts about just how strongly the economy is likely to bounce back from the first quarter, when the economy contracted at an annual pace of 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Feroli, an economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>, said rising stock markets and rebounding home prices aren't pumping up the economy the way they used to, largely because many of the gains are going to affluent Americans, who tend to save. Indeed, the so-called wealth effect -- the extent to which rising wealth leads to consumption and growth -- is roughly half as strong as that of previous economic expansions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another gauge of Americans' wealth -- U.S. net worth as a share of disposable income -- remains slightly below levels seen in 2006, <span class="companylink">Fed</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. stock market rose in the first quarter, with the broad <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index nudging up about 1% after a 30% gain last year. Real-estate values also rebounded strongly last quarter, helping spread the benefits of the nation's economic improvements. The value of stocks and mutual funds owned by households rose $361 billion last quarter, while the value of residential real estate grew more than twice that, $751 billion, according to the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent jump in the value of real-estate holdings "could increase the wealth effect," Mr. Feroli said, though he warned Americans' responses to housing gains generally "kick in slowly over time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many Americans, housing is the most important financial asset. As real-estate values rise, Americans are gaining more equity in their homes, which makes it easier to sell them, refinance debts, borrow and spend. A measure of owners' equity as a share of the value of real-estate holdings hit 53.6% in the first quarter, up from 51.6% in the fourth quarter, a postrecession high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another positive sign in Thursday's report: Americans are feeling a little more comfortable about borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall household borrowing rose at an annualized 2% pace in the first quarter, compared with 0.2% in the fourth quarter. While mortgage debt shrank 0.9%, the drop was less than the previous quarter's 1.1% fall. Other types of consumer credit, including student loans, grew 6.6%, above the fourth quarter's 5.3% pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of digging out from heavy debts assumed during the boom years, Americans are now finding their debt burdens easing. Total U.S. household debt was about 108% of disposable income in the first quarter, down from a peak burden of roughly 135% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more manageable debt burden, along with rising levels of equity in homes, could prompt American households to borrow and spend more at a time when unemployment remains high and wages are only starting to rise after years in the doldrums.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as New York City's commercial property market recovers, the purchase of a large delinquent commercial loan tied to a Midtown tower shows some creditors are still nursing wounds they suffered during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $160 million commercial mortgage secured by a 22-story office tower at 119 W. 40th St. was sold to the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LLP</span> earlier this year, more than four years after it fell into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, creditors lost almost $49 million in the deal, according to <span class="companylink">Trepp LLC</span>, a New York-based data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the loan's sale price -- $165.7 million -- is a sign that values of properties are rising to pre-crash levels, and the total value of delinquent commercial-property loans is falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the larger delinquent commercial loans, including the one associated with 119 W. 40th St., have been in default for a while, said Joe McBride, research analyst for Trepp. "Seeing it get sold for as much as it did is a good sign," he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many properties bought across New York City during the boom times came with high prices and a lot of debt, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan on the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex is among the city's largest commercial mortgages in default, with an original principal amount of $3 billion. The special servicer representing bondholders in that case recently took steps toward a sale later this year or in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value associated with loans more than 30 days delinquent in New York City dropped in April to $3.7 billion, down almost 30% from $5.2 billion in 2011, according to Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest losses in the fourth quarter of 2013 for commercial mortgage-backed securities deals, New York had the lowest percentage loss at 25.3%, and Detroit had the highest at 60.5%, according to Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many commercial property investors buying before the financial crisis, the group that purchased 119 W. 40th St. in 2007 envisioned a renovated building that would command rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">L.H. Charney Associates Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">George Comfort &amp; Sons Inc</span>., and Fortis Property Group LLC formed a joint venture and bought the 1915 tower for about $162 million. L.H. Charney Associates and Fortis Property Group declined to comment; <span class="companylink">George Comfort &amp; Sons</span> didn't respond to inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal required another $42.7 million for reserves and closing costs, according to CWCapital Asset Management LLC, the special servicer representing bondholders. The group financed the deal with a $160 million mortgage and a $22.25 million mezzanine loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But renovations took longer than expected. Signing leases for market-rate rents fell behind schedule, according to a 2009 <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings Inc</span>. report on a pool of commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2008, the office building had an average rent of $21.95 a square feet, far below the $45 a square feet appraisal for market-rate rent, according to Trepp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan was transferred to CWCapital in June 2009 because the loan was on the verge of default, according to Trepp. The joint venture defaulted on the loan in July 2009, and CWCapital eventually started foreclosure proceedings in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the joint venture filed motions alleging CWCapital had refused to release reserve funds set aside for repairs and renovations. In response, CWCapital said there were insufficient funds in the reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some tenants withheld rent because of renovation delays. Court documents for some of the tenant disputes show that the complaints against the property owner were dismissed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure of the property had been on schedule for mid-2014 when the debt was sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2013, the mezzanine loan, which had been acquired at a discount in 2007, was repaid at a negotiated lowered amount. CWCapital put the debt of the original mortgage along with other unpaid loans worth billions of dollars on the auction block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> emerged as the highest bidder. It views the $165.7 million price tag as a "sizable discount" for an office building in the neighborhood that surrounds Bryant Park, said Frank Cohen, a partner in <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s real-estate investment group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the amount paid for the debt was about the same that the venture paid in 2007, creditors still lost money because of accrued interest payments, reimbursement of principal and interest advances made over the years and other fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bryant Park has become one of the most desirable office locations not only because of the attractiveness of the park but the proximity to Grand Central and Penn Station and quick access to Times Square," Mr. Cohen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> owns several buildings in the area, including 1095 Sixth Ave., which will soon house a <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> on the ground and second floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm intends to improve the property at 119 W. 40th St. and eventually sell it for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> is in the process of negotiating an agreement with the involved parties to take ownership of the building without formal foreclosure proceedings, according to someone familiar with the discussions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Homes paid $99 million to Kushner Real Estate Group and Ironstate Development Company for the location at 281 Fifth Ave. at 30 Street, about four blocks from Madison Square Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale closed Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yoav Oelsner and Glenn Tolchin, both executive vice presidents at JLL, represented both sides in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location has development and air rights that would allow Victor Homes to put up a 40-story residential tower with 132,000 square feet, said Jonathan Kushner, president of Kushner Real Estate Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase price works out to $750 a buildable square foot, one of the highest rates paid for a residential site in Manhattan, according to city property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pricing that this group offered us was attractive enough," Mr. Kushner said. "It's one of the hottest neighborhoods in New York City."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Victor Homes completed a luxury high-rise at 241 Fifth Ave., about two blocks from the land it just purchased.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A company that makes exercise bikes with sweat-resistant video screens has picked an office-and-retail tower building in Chelsea to be its new headquarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peloton Interactive LLC is taking the fourth floor of the 12-story building at 158 W. 27th St., between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. Its offices are now at 227 W. 29th St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team—Ethan Silverstein, Mark Mandell, Mattias Li and Bruce Mosler-- represented the building's owner, Emmes Asset Management. Ben Shapiro and Ben Birnbaum of <span class="companylink">Newmark Grubb Knight Frank</span> represented Peloton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new space totals 9,661 square feet; the asking rent was $59 a square foot, according to Mr. Silverstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emmes is fitting out the space for Peloton, which expects to move within a month; Iconic Entertainment Inc. had occupied the space, Mr. Silverstein said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. stocks rose on Thursday as investors weighed a weak report on economic growth and a strong one from the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 22 points, or 0.1%, to 16656 in midday trading. The S&amp;P 500 advanced five points, or 0.3%, to 1915 and the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> Composite Index added 16 points, or 0.4%, to 4241.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major indexes traded in a narrow band in below-average volume after the second estimate of first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product showed the economy contracted at a seasonally adjusted 1%, more than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors largely brushed off the weak report, saying that it essentially told the market what is already known: that the economy was sluggish in the first three months of 2014, in large part because of harsh winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest GDP report does little to change the monetary-policy trajectory of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is reducing its bond purchases but remains committed to keeping interest rates low for an extended period, according to Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, which manages about $242 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are dismissing some of the weakness and expecting that there is going to be strength in the future," Mr. Jacobsen said. "It's not about what was, it's about what will happen. A lot of what will happen will be driven by central-bank policies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anastasia Amoroso, global market strategist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> Funds, which oversees about $400 billion, was similarly unmoved by the weak economic reading, which she likened to "looking in the rearview mirror."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, she is focused on more-recent economic data that has shown signs of improvement. Jobless claims in the week ended May 24 fell more than expected and remained near prerecession levels, according to the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span>. The number of Americans filing claims for new jobless benefits fell by 27,000 to a seasonally adjusted 300,000, versus an expected to decline to 319,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report on pending home sales for April rose 0.4%, below expectations for a gain of 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note rose to 2.424% from 2.440% late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European markets were little changed. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.1% to 344.51. Traders positioned for next week's <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> monetary-policy meeting, at which the central bank is widely expected to announce new stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures added 0.8% to $103.52 a barrel, while gold futures lost 0.3% to $1,255.60 a troy ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar fell against the euro and the yen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In U.S. corporate news, <span class="companylink">Apple</span> rose 0.8% after it confirmed late Wednesday that it would buy headphone and audio software company <span class="companylink">Beats Electronics</span> and subscription streaming music service Beats Music for a combined $3 billion.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Jon Huntsman, Sr. Lowers the Price of Park City Home to $34 Million; The house was first listed in 2009 for $55 million and has since seen several price cuts.</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back on the construction of his 12-bedroom, 16-bath ski house in Park City, Jon M. Huntsman, Sr. said: "I went a little bit overboard when I built the thing, I have to admit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one reason the billionaire Utah businessman, founder of <span class="companylink">Huntsman Corp</span>. and father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon M. Huntsman, Jr., is cutting the price of the house again, this time to $34 million, from $44 million. The house was first listed in 2009 for $55 million and has since seen several price cuts. It was listed at $44 million about a year ago, according to listing agent Paul Benson of Summit Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the price cut, it is still the highest-priced property for sale in Utah, according to Mr. Benson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 22,000-square-foot house sits on over 60 wooded acres in Deer Valley, and is constructed of timber reclaimed from Yellowstone National Park. With two "bunk rooms," it can sleep about 44 people, Mr. Huntsman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He purchased the land—16 separate parcels—and built the home in the late 1980s. He and his wife have nine children and 56 grandchildren, he said, so he needed to ensure the house would be big enough to fit the whole family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was what Mr. Huntsman called "one of the most grandiose homes ever built in America," with an indoor swimming pool, a fitness center and a 22-car garage. The furniture, much of which was custom-made for the home, is for sale along with the house. The home is decorated with the Huntsmans' extensive collection of Native American artifacts, but those aren't for sale, he said. (Mr. Huntsman disputed previous reports in The Journal that the house cost more than $100 million to build and furnish, saying he's not sure how much money he put into it over the years.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family used the property—which has a lake, a stream and hiking trails—in all seasons for years, he said. But he now owns a resort in Idaho, where he was born and raised, and spends much of his time there. "We don't use Deer Valley much," he said, noting that he is planning to keep his primary residence in Salt Lake City as well as his home in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Huntsman, 76, said he hopes the reduced price will help the home sell quickly, so he can use the proceeds to help fund construction of a new 220,000-square-foot research facility at the <span class="companylink">Huntsman Cancer Institute</span> at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. </p>

</div><div class="author">Min Zeng </div><div>650 words</div><div>29 May 2014</div><div>11:40</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roaring U.S. government bond market pulled back Thursday after the yield on the benchmark 10-year note hit an 11-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year note's yield at one point Thursday tumbled to 2.401%, the lowest intraday level since June 21, 2013. At the end of the session, it rose to 2.445%, and the note's price was 2/32 lower, according to Tradeweb. When bond yields rise, their prices fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said investors who deemed the price strength overdone cashed out some chips. As a sign buying interest was sated, a sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes drew the lowest foreign investors' demand in six months as the auction offered the lowest yield since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield, a key global benchmark to set long-term interest rates for consumers and businesses, has dropped nearly 0.2 percentage points in May. The yield traded at about 3% at the start of January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, analysts and traders said factors that have boosted the allure of haven <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> bonds remain in place: concerns over the uneven pace of global economic growth and firm commitment by major central banks to keep interest rates near zero for longer to support growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bonds are overbought so profit taking seems legit to me," said Adrian Miller, director of global markets strategy at <span class="companylink">GMP Securities</span>. "But that's not to suggest yields have bottomed out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors had scooped up bonds earlier Thursday after pending new home sales rose 0.4% in April, much lower than the 2% forecast. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen earlier this month has cited weakness in the housing market in recent months as a risk to the growth outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data Thursday pointed to an uncertain growth outlook. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter for the first time in three years. On the positive side, initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by a bigger-than-forecast 27,000 to a seasonally adjusted 300,000 in the week ended May 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is just relentless buying in Treasury bonds," said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading at <span class="companylink">Bank of Nova Scotia</span>. "Maybe the bond market is predicting that growth would be weaker than people think and the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> may hold rates near zero longer than people think."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Comiskey said that buyers included Asian investors who see U.S. bond yields as more attractive compared with those of Japanese government bonds. The 10-year Japanese government bond yielded 0.566%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One thing is for sure-don't stand in front of the train right now," he said, referring to the rally in Treasury bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said month-end buying has been another boost for bonds. Some fund managers need to reshuffle their portfolios to align with benchmark indexes. On the last trading session of each month, new bonds replace maturing debt in bond indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Erik Schiller, senior portfolio manager for global government bonds at <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>.'s fixed-income unit, which oversees $405 billion, said he expects the 10-year yield could drop to 2.2% before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling yields this year have dealt a blow to bond bears this year who called for bond yields to extend last year's rise. Leading into the year, optimism reigned supreme that the U.S. economy would pick up more momentum from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders said short bets--which wager that bond prices to fall and yields to rise--have been forced to dial back in recent weeks as the bond market's strength continued to confound bond bears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a tough time to fight against the rallying market,'' said Michael Franzese, senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets in New York.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kathleen Madigan </div><div>302 words</div><div>27 May 2014</div><div>07:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices across the U.S. are still inching up but the pace continues to lose momentum, according to a report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices increased 0.2% in the first quarter of this year from the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index report. Compared with a year earlier, national home prices are up 10.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller increases in home prices mean less wealth for many Americans via home equity, dulling some confidence in the economy. Stalled price growth also will limit choices for builders of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 12.6% in the year that ended in March, while the 20-city index advanced 12.4%. That is a slowdown from February's 12.9% yearly pace, but better than the 11.8% expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Annual price increases for the two composites have slowed in the last four months," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data on the housing market recently has been decidedly mixed. Existing home sales in April rose for the first time in 2014, while new home sales for the month jumped 6.4%. However, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' confidence index for May dropped to its lowest level in 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pricing slowdown reflects weaker demand for buying a home. The report noted mortgage rates have risen from a year earlier. In addition, "Recent comments from the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> point to bank lending standards as a problem. Other comments include arguments that student loan debt is preventing many potential first time buyers from entering the housing market." </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 hit a record, but the peak was reached against a backdrop of subdued trading activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index rose 8.04 points, or 0.4%, to 1900.53, topping its previous record close of 1897.45 from May 13.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock-market bulls have stayed the course amid continued evidence of slow-but-steady improvement in corporate profits and the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, some money managers say stocks look attractive compared to bonds, which are offering historically low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some traders said the week's gains in major stock indexes stemmed partly from investors' response to the rout in fast-growing technology stocks in recent months. Investors who had fled during that selloff were snapping up shares again, helping to drive the market broadly higher, said Doug Crofton, head of U.S. cash equity trading at <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"From a positioning standpoint, clients are under-invested," Mr. Crofton said. "There's a chase to increase exposure" to stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 63.19 points, or 0.4%, to 16606.27 Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 31.47 points, or 0.8%, to 4185.81.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With little in the way of economic data or corporate earnings reports, it was a quiet week on Wall Street ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend in the U.S. Friday saw 4.5 billion shares change hands, the lowest volume of any day this year. The <span class="companylink">Chicago Board Options Exchange</span> Volatility Index, a measure of traders' expectations for future stock-market swings, fell to a 14-month low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many financial markets in the U.S., including the stock market, are closed on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the economic front, sales of newly built homes in the U.S. rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000 in April, the Commerce Department reported, topping the 420,000 median estimate of economists in a Wall Street Journal poll. March's rate was revised higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders' shares rose on the report. The iShares U.S. Home Construction exchange-traded fund, which tracks a basket of such stocks, added 2.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a week of light earnings data, the economic calendar has been light, but what we've seen has been positive," said Neil Massa, senior equity trader at John Hancock Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics point to the fact a long-awaited acceleration in economic activity has yet to emerge, and last year's rally has left stocks less attractively valued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro slumped to a fresh three-month low against the dollar as a measure of business sentiment in Germany, the economic engine of the euro zone, came in below expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak reading heightened expectations that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will take measures to ease monetary policy at its next meeting in June, which could weigh on the euro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro weakened 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3630, its lowest late New York level since Feb. 12. For the week, the common currency fell 0.5% against the greenback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net wagers against the euro in the futures market increased to $1.6 billion in the week ended May 20, from $373 million in the previous period, according to data from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But European stocks edged higher, with the Stoxx Europe 600 rising 0.2%, to cap its sixth consecutive weekly gain, the longest such streak this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian markets were mostly higher. Japan's <span class="companylink">Nikkei</span> Stock Average rose 0.9% to a three-week high, and China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crude-oil futures rose 0.6% to settle at $104.35 a barrel, while gold futures eased 0.3% to settle at $1,291.60 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In corporate news, <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> added $1.94, or 6.1%, to $33.72, after reporting quarterly earnings in line with analysts' forecasts and announcing an additional 11,000 to 16,000 job cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shale-oil driller <span class="companylink">Parsley Energy</span> jumped 3.70, or 20%, to 22.20, in its trading debut. Late Thursday, the Midland, Texas, company and some of its early equity holders sold more shares than expected for a greater price than forecast in an initial public offering.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Mark Magnier   </div><div>656 words</div><div>23 May 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Asia</div><div>AWSJ</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING -- A pickup in China's exports and factory orders is likely to reduce pressure on the government for broad-based stimulus to boost an overall slowing Chinese economy, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A preliminary gauge of manufacturing activity released Thursday showed a bump-up in business for factories for May. That follows broader April export growth for China, as well as for South Korea and Taiwan, which supply components for many Chinese products shipped abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing signs of life in China's export engine appear to result from consumers in the U.S. and Europe, which are China's major markets, prying open their wallets a bit wider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the improved factory sentiment is good news, even if sustained, it is likely only to cushion but not counteract a deceleration in economic growth that was already under way. And growth is being slowed further by a crumbling housing market, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seems that exports are bouncing back quicker than expected, but there are lots of signs of domestic weakness, especially in the property market," said Citibank economist Ding Shuang. Nonetheless, he said he expects no major fiscal or monetary stimulus in the near future. "This year we'll see weaker domestic demand and better export demand," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest pickup in exports and factory orders follows the rollout of targeted government measures to prop up growth, chiefly accelerating spending on public housing and infrastructure, among others. But economists said Beijing can be expected to do more of the same, rather than reach for broad-based fiscal or monetary stimulus. "I don't believe monetary stimulus is necessary," said Fan Zhang, an economist at CIMB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's economy grew 7.4% in the first quarter from a year earlier, more slowly than the 7.7% pace in the final quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> lowered its 2014 full-year economic growth forecast for the country to 7.3% from 7.5% and its 2015 forecast to 6.8% from 7.0% because of worries over the property market. That lowered projection came a day after <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> cut its outlook for Chinese real estate to negative from stable. New construction starts in the property sector fell 24.5% year-to-year in the January-April period measured by area, according to government statistics released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should Beijing want to strengthen its measures for growth, one of the biggest tools would be a cut in the amount of funds banks are required to keep in reserve. That would make more money available for lending but could also add to already high debt burdens, economists have said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do not expect further macro easing," said RBS economist Louis Kuijs in a research note. "Policy makers will first want to see the impact of the easing already in the pipeline. Also, despite concerns in the markets about growth, from the perspective of policy makers, things do not look so bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's preliminary purchasing managers index released by <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> and research firm Markit stood at 49.7 for May, a four-month high, compared with a final reading of 48.1 for April. A reading of 50 or above signals growth, while a number below that suggests contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's factory- and export-order components both rose above 50, which economists attributed to more orders tied to government spending on infrastructure and higher overseas demand. U.S. consumer spending rose 0.9% in March, the largest gain in more than four years. Retail sales in the battered euro zone also ticked up marginally, 0.3%, beating expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> index tends to survey sentiment among smaller companies. Economists also expect an upturn in the official factory outlook to be released early next month, which tracks larger state-owned concerns.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A broad measure of U.S. home sales rose in April for the first time this year, a sign that the housing recovery regained momentum during the crucial spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 1.3% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.65 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That was slightly lower than a 4.68 million rate forecast by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and was 6.8% lower than the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick followed a rise in the trade group's March tally of pending home sales, which typically precede existing home sales by one or two months and signaled a rebound for the sector after a harsh winter. The coming months are crucial for the U.S. housing market because families generally prefer to move to a home in a new school district by the end of the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think the recent slump in home sales may now be in the past," said Daniel Silver, economist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, which account for roughly 90% of transactions in the U.S., surged in 2012 and in the first half of 2013, helping to spur investment in home building and drive the broader economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales started to weaken last summer as rising prices and mortgage rates pinched affordability. Unusually cold and stormy winter weather depressed sales further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing investment -- including expenditures on home construction, improvement and brokers' commissions -- fell in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the first time in over three years and declined again in the first quarter of 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect the housing industry to strengthen this quarter as improving weather releases pent-up demand. But they are unsure about the strength of the sector's underlying momentum. The Commerce Department will release its tally of new home sales in April on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern over recent weakness in housing. Minutes of their April 29-30 meeting published Wednesday showed that their outlook for a gradually improving economy hadn't changed, but that some officials had "pointed to possible sources of downside risk to growth, including a persistent slowdown in the housing sector."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing-home-sales report showed that home-price gains moderated in April while the supply of homes for sale increased, both factors that could help sustain demand for housing in the months ahead. Nationally, home prices were up 5.2% to a median of $201,700 in April, the slowest annual price gain since March 2012. The inventory of homes available for sale rose to 5.9 months of supply from five months in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> economist Lawrence Yun said he considers a six- to seven-month supply to be a "normal" level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are getting close to balanced market conditions," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building should also help to ease supply shortages. Data released last week by the Commerce Department showed that U.S. home construction in April surged to its highest level since November.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of new homes rose in April, a possible sign the housing market is picking up after its rebound moderated over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales climbed 6.4% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. That partly unwound a drop the prior month, with home sales rising at a revised 407,000 pace. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast monthly sales would jump to a 420,000 annual pace for April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The tone of the April new home sales report was quite encouraging," said Millan Mulraine at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>. The report and other measures of the housing market "are collectively pointing to a rebound in U.S. housing market activity after the recovery essentially stalled during the prior nine months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report included new seasonal adjustments for the sales pace for all months from January 2012, the Commerce Department said. Those revisions showed that the rate of home purchases was slightly weaker in the second half of last year through February than previously estimated. However, a Commerce Department economist said the new monthly figures didn't affect the overall sales estimate for 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data have yet to show a meaningful pickup in activity early on in the spring following the unusually harsh winter," said <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> economist Daniel Silver. "But at least the recent sales data now look more favorable than what had been evident in the March report."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family houses represent a fraction of homes purchased in the U.S. and can be subject to large revisions. But the report provides a more timely reading of the housing market than other measures because it tallies sales at the moment a contract is signed rather than at its closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be home buyers have been stifled in recent months by rising home prices and mortgage rates that can crimp affordability. Unseasonably cool winter weather may have also held home builders back earlier this year, many economists believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, sales of new homes were down 4.2%. The median price of a home remained elevated at $275,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have been very conservative in this recovery and continue to drag their feet in terms of providing new-home supply, which represents one of the reasons that prices have risen so fast over the past two years," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there may be signs of growth under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders ramped up construction on new homes for the third straight month in April, with project starts rising 13.2% from the prior month, the Commerce Department said in a separate report last week. The increase was fueled by a jump in multifamily homes, but construction of single-family houses rose as well. New applications for building permits, a sign of future construction, grew 8% in April from the month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more reliable building permits data suggest that demand for new single-family homes bottomed out in the first quarter after a rate-related pullback in late 2013, and has resumed mild growth," economists at Wrightson ICAP said ahead of Friday's report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of sales of previously owned homes rose 1.3% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.65 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Existing-home sales account for roughly 90% of transactions in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are some signs of caution ahead. U.S. home builders were downbeat in May, with an index of confidence down one point to its lowest level in 12 months, according to a <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> survey released last week. The decline was driven by negative view of current sales conditions, although builders' expectations for sales in the next six months improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is expected to keep short-term interest rates low until 2015. Mortgage rates have ticked up since last summer when the Fed first signaled it would pull back on its easy-money policies. But a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage had an average interest rate of 4.33% at the end of April and has fallen slightly so far this month, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a survey of its members done this month by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> showed builders' confidence falling to its lowest level in a year, which could be a bad sign for future construction.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing activity remains tepid with the vast majority of sales in the multi-family unit space," said Lindsey Piegza, economist at Sterne Agee.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Robbie Whelan and Conor Dougherty </div><div>913 words</div><div>21 May 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a buying binge that helped drive the housing recovery, big investors are being forced to rethink the home-rental business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With bargains less plentiful, executives are slowing property purchases and turning their focus to generating steady income from tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spike in home prices over the past two years was quicker and more striking than many expected, squeezing returns and raising concerns about the industry's growth prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small investors long have bought and sold homes. But two years ago when companies such as private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span> got into the business, backers said it could emerge as an asset class rivaling publicly owned apartment-rental companies, which own over 600,000 units and have a stock-market value of $88 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies jumped into distressed markets, buying foreclosed properties and other homes at depressed prices with plans to fix them up, rent them and eventually sell at a profit. But buyers have slowed their pace after acquiring roughly 140,000 homes worth about $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason: the unexpectedly sharp recovery in the price of homes over the past two years. In housing markets hardest hit by the bust -- places like Phoenix, Las Vegas and much of Southern California -- prices have risen as much as 55% off their postcrash lows. Nationally, prices are up 11.4% in the past two years, according to <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The distressed wave has largely passed," said Jonathan Gray, head of real estate for New York-based <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, which has spent $8.6 billion on some 45,000 homes and is the biggest player in the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of its buying in July 2013, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> was spending about $140 million a week on homes; now it is spending roughly $30 million to $40 million. "We didn't anticipate prices going up 20% a year," Mr. Gray said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices have forced many investors to accept lower returns than they originally had projected in certain markets, or to buy homes in new cities where the price appreciation has been less rapid. Two years ago, investors could buy in Sunbelt markets such as Phoenix and Las Vegas for gross yields that were in the 15% range, according to Green Street Advisors. That has fallen to around 10%, often lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors have decided to hold onto homes for longer than they originally expected because a larger proportion of investor returns is coming from rent instead of the home's rising value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The initial investment thesis was to invest in these homes, make a nice return on the way, and be positioned to sell them for a nice profit," said Gary Beasley, co-CEO of <span class="companylink">Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust</span>, one of four public companies in the business. "As we got into it in the first year or two, it became clear that it might be more valuable to hold onto these homes in the long term, and really treat them like a scattered-site apartment building."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> report found that buy-to-rent investors have bought about $400 million worth of homes a month in the first few months of 2014, down from about $520 million a month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor demand has cooled for stock in the four rental-home companies that went public to fund their expansion. Only <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> has a stock trading above its IPO price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Puryear, director of real-estate research for <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp; Associates</span>, said investors have been cool to the stocks in part because home-price growth has leveled off, and because the industry still hasn't grown to a critical mass. "There are too many skeptics in the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives say there is plenty of money to be made from renting. They say more households became renters after the downturn because of the high rate of foreclosure and the inability or unwillingness of many to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, apartment rents have been steadily rising for 17 quarters, according to real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. They are now 11% higher than they were in late 2009 when they hit their postcrash low, Reis says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irvine, Calif.-based American Property Group's search for yield in the Midwest is paying off, according to its CEO, Saman Shams. Recent acquisitions include a three-bedroom house with a big front yard on North Cherry Lake Lane in Indianapolis. About a month ago, the company paid $67,000 for the home and is spending $15,000 on renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to rent the house for $1,150 a month. After costs, this will produce just under $10,000 in net income, or an annual net yield of 11.2%, much higher than the 5% to 7% net yields most investors are getting in other markets. "We're holding these homes for the long term," Mr. Shams said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say the growth of the industry will depend in large part on whether investors can continue to get the better of traditional buyers. Investors have had an advantage in many markets because they have been able to pay cash and close quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could change if the economy improves and mortgages get easier to obtain. Individuals may be able to outbid investors because they can get lower interest rates and aren't as concerned about rate of return.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home construction surged in April and building permits rose to the highest level in more than five years, a sign the industry is rebounding after a weak winter and sees room for growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 13.2% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.07 million, the Commerce Department said Friday, though the bulk of the gain came in the volatile multifamily segment. The overall gain was still the strongest showing in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly approved applications for building permits, a bellwether of future construction, grew 8% in April from the prior month to a pace of 1.08 million, reaching the highest level since summer 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday's report shows that a crucial piece of the economy, battered during the recession, is improving slowly after taking a dip over the winter. "The further behind us that we put the bad news of several years ago, the better it gets" said Joel Shine, chief executive of Woodside Homes in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the demand for new homes has been coming from upper-end buyers rather than those purchasing their first home. The median price of a new home rose to $290,000 in March, the highest level on record, as builders targeted wealthier borrowers, according to an earlier government report. Many first-time buyers, who may have blemishes on their credit records, have a hard time getting a mortgage, so builders have been focusing on larger, more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been coping with a soft housing market so far this year. Sales of newly built homes fell in March to the lowest level since last July, after stormy winter weather slowed down construction. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said this past week that builders' confidence in the market for single-family homes fell to the lowest level in 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many in the housing industry took encouragement this past week that the new chief of the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> will make it easier for more Americans to qualify for loans. Mel Watt, who in January took over as chief regulator of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, said he would push the mortgage-finance companies to ease lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Friday's report, housing starts were up 26.4% from a year earlier. The pace of construction for March was revised lower, showing a 2% gain from the previous month, compared with an initially reported 2.8% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall increase in housing starts was fueled by a jump in multifamily homes rather than the single-family market, which provides a bigger lift to the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures for multifamily homes, including condominiums and apartments, are volatile from month to month. Construction of multifamily homes rose by nearly 40% in April, the report said. Construction of single-family homes was up 0.8%, reaching the fourth-highest level since the start of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For observers tempted to conclude that recent worry about the housing market's health "was much ado about nothing, we suggest you curb your enthusiasm, at least for now," wrote Richard Moody, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>, in a note to clients. The report, he wrote, "shows more of the same -- a vibrant multifamily segment with a single-family segment still awaiting takeoff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After fueling the economy in recent years, the housing market has struggled to regain momentum since last summer. Higher interest rates, coupled with a run-up in home prices, have priced out many prospective home buyers, damping overall demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the housing industry will provide only a small lift to the economy this year. "We expect housing to contribute positively to economic growth this year, but the magnitude of its contribution likely will be only modest," wrote <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> economist Dana Saporta.</p>

Construction of multifamily homes with at least two units rose by nearly 40% in April, the report said. Construction of single-family homes was up 0.8%, reaching the fourth-highest level since the start of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For observers tempted to conclude that recent worry about the housing market's health "was much ado about nothing, we suggest you curb your enthusiasm, at least for now," wrote Richard Moody, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>, in a note to clients. The report, he wrote, "shows more of the same-- a vibrant multifamily segment with a single-family segment still awaiting takeoff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After fueling the economy in recent years, the housing market has struggled to regain momentum since last summer. Higher interest rates, coupled with a run-up in home prices, have priced out many prospective home buyers, damping overall demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say the housing industry will provide only a small lift to the economy this year. "We expect housing to contribute positively to economic growth this year, but the magnitude of its contribution likely will be only modest," wrote <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> economist Dana Saporta.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- Less than a year after buying New York's One Chase Manhattan Plaza, Shanghai conglomerate Fosun Group has again reached out for overseas real estate, this time in Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday,Fosun, whose interests in China range from real estate to mining and pharmaceuticals, said it has bought Tokyo-based real-estate management firm <span class="companylink">IDERA Capital Management Ltd</span>. from <span class="companylink">Unison Capital</span>, a Japanese private-equity firm. A spokesman for Fosun declined to comment on how much the company paid. The acquisition follows a run-up in Japanese real-estate prices in the past year, as investors seek out fresh opportunities in a recovering economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Explaining the attraction of IDERA, a Fosun spokesman said the company'smanagement team had experience navigating the property market after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Japanese firm also has raised money from global institutional investors, a network that Fosun would see "whether it's possible" to tap into in the long term, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is the latest in a string of purchases overseas that is garnering international attention for Fosun, including luxury brands in Europe and a landmark building in New York City. Last year, Fosun spent $725 million on the 60-story tower at One Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York, in what was among the biggest purchases of U.S. property by a Chinese investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its first overseas real-estate acquisition, Fosun bought the office building Lloyds Chambers in London for GBP 64.5 million ($108.1 million) last year. Outside of real estate, Fosun bought what used to be Portugal's largest insurer, the insurance arm of state bank <span class="companylink">Caixa Geral de Depositos</span>, for $1.36 billion in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun has also taken minority stakes in brands such as the Greek jeweler <span class="companylink">Folli Follie Group</span> and French hotel operator <span class="companylink">Club Mediterranee SA</span>, which Fosun got approval from the French government to take over in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun bought the Japanese real-estate management firm through its Hong Kong-listed unit, <span class="companylink">Fosun International Ltd</span>. IDERA managed 160 billion yen ($1.57 billion) as of the end of last year, including office, residential and retail properties, as well as real-estate funds. The company was founded in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase is Fosun's first acquisition in Japan as well as its first acquisition in real-estate management. Fosun has an in-house real-estate management arm that oversees its domestic properties, which include landmarks such as the Yu Gardens tourist shopping complex in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fosun's spokesman said the company would continue to look at buying landmarks in global financial centers, including in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may not be in the next six to 12 months," but Fosun is "seriously considering" the city, the spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's interest in buying real estate abroad is increasing, especially as the market at home slows. Many Chinese developers are facing tighter credit conditions, lower returns and slower demand for residential properties, as well as increased competition due to a deepening supply glut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese developers spent $2.1 billion on commercial and residential property overseas in the first quarter, up 25% from the same period in 2013, according to data from <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Spending on commercial buildings has largely focused on Chicago, London, Sydney and other gateway cities in the U.S., Australia and the U.K. However, individual Chinese buyers have also branched out beyond traditional markets to places such as Miami Beach, Edinburgh and other second-tier cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's real-estate industry is on the rebound, benefiting from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic and monetary policies, which are known as Abenomics. In particular, total commercial property transactions in Tokyo were higher than in any other major city in the world in the first quarter, according to Jones Lang. LaSalle.</p>

</div><div class="author">Patrick Fitzgerald </div><div>468 words</div><div>14 May 2014</div><div>11:21</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A U.S. bankruptcy judge signed off on the sale of some €15 billion ($20.6 billion) of soured loans on the books of what was once one of Ireland's largest banks as the country digs out from the wreckage of its collapsed property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Christopher Sontchi on Tuesday approved <span class="companylink">Irish Bank Resolution Corp</span>.'s sale of the loan portfolios at a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IBRC, a state-backed bank liquidating the former Anglo Irish Bank Corp., is selling the bad loans at a discount to a group of distressed-debt buyers, including affiliates of <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank AG</span>, and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group</span>. Liquidators sought approval from the U.S. bankruptcy judge because of ties that some of the loans have to the U.S. Such ties include properties located in the U.S., or a borrower who is a U.S. resident or has become one since the loan was made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The green light from Judge Sontchi allows the sales to go through free of liens, claims and encumbrances as part of a Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. that is linked to the Irish recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals relieve Irish taxpayers of the worry of cleaning up after Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and <span class="companylink">Irish Nationwide Building Society</span>, which were swept under when prices for homes and commercial real estate collapsed during the global financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irish government stepped in, and the two distressed institutions were put together to create IBRC in July 2011. The toxic debt burden continued to weigh on Ireland, however, prompting a decision to get rid of the portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Anglo Irish collapse, in particular, still echoes in Ireland. Last month, two former Anglo Irish executives were found guilty of illegally lending money to prop up the bank's shares in 2008. The bank's former chairman was acquitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan-portfolio sales are the last major burden the Irish government shouldered when it took over the failed banks and began managing their assets. They involve loans from IBRC's Stone, Pebble, Rock, Blackrock and Sand portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S. is designed to allow international corporations to safeguard their U.S. assets from creditors while working out their financial difficulties in proceedings governed by the laws of their home countries. Special liquidators at <span class="companylink">KPMG</span> initiated a Chapter 15 bankruptcy for IBRC last year, after Ireland began to exit the bad-bank business that was weighing on its national finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, IBRC's liquidators have sold nearly €20 billion of commercial and real estate mortgage loans.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandra Lee -- the celebrity chef and the live-in girlfriend of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- settled multiple building code violations at her Westchester County home with the help of a state official.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee didn't apply for the proper building permits at the Westchester County property she owns on Bittersweet Lane in the town of New Castle, N.Y., when she made changes there sometime before 2012, said William Maskiell, a town building inspector. Mr. Cuomo lives at the home and shares the cost of property taxes with Ms. Lee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has since received approval for the changes to the $1.2 million property, though it took her about six months to apply for the necessary permits, Mr. Maskiell said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Journal-News in Westchester County reported on Ms. Lee's building permits on Sunday. The Food Network, on which Ms. Lee appears, declined to comment. A representative for Ms. Lee didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maskiell said he began investigating in late 2011 after driving by the home and noticing changes to the property, including a new gazebo and a building shed, Mr. Maskiell said. He said the renovations that Ms. Lee described in interviews in Elle Decor, USA Today and other publications would have likely needed permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he reached out to Ms. Lee in writing and soon a government representative of Mr. Cuomo returned his inquiries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I sent out a notice to Ms. Lee. And a gentleman, I guess he worked for the governor, got back to me," Mr. Maskiell said. "He asked me what was required in terms of building permits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Journal-News identified the official as Larry Schwartz, Mr. Cuomo's highest-ranking aide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months later, when the Cuomo aide hadn't returned Mr. Maskiell's phone calls and emails requesting more information about the property, the building inspector said he got fed up. "After months of that, it was enough, so I sent a violation notice," he said. "We had to act on it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maskiell said the violations were for failure to secure building and wetland permits. Town records weren't available for inspection on Sunday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometime in the first part of 2012 Ms. Lee applied for and received the proper permits, with fees totaling about $1,000, Mr. Maskiell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, Mr. Cuomo's Republican rival in this year's gubernatorial election, questioned why a government official intervened on Ms. Lee's behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the governor should be subject to the same local ordinances as his neighbors. "If the average person has to go through this then the governor should as well," Ms. Proud said of the permit process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A campaign spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said: "This is just Rob Astorino playing his little Westchester political games about a gazebo when he should be doing his job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maskiell said he has no plans to take further action against Ms. Lee, despite a spate of recent magazine interviews in which she talks openly about renovations she and Mr. Cuomo have made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really don't know what was done," Mr. Maskiell said. "Sometimes the people in the magazines, they get a little carried away with how grandiose a job they did when it may just be that they put in new tile and painted the walls."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France, Germany: Europe Divided</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a widening gulf at the heart of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">France and Germany account for half of the bloc's economy and 44% of its population. The euro zone's success relies on both countries flourishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But gross-domestic-product data, due this week, will likely show that Germany had a strong first quarter while France barely expanded and was probably outpaced by crisis-hit Spain. Worse, the French malaise that President Francois Hollande has belatedly started to recognize is deeply entrenched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly a decade ago, Germany, then seen as the sick man of Europe, got serious about overhauling its economy, something France has yet to do. The results started to become clear in the middle of the last decade, when German growth rates started to decisively overtake those in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, Germany's economy has expanded 11.6%, including 2009's recession, which was far more severe than in France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter has expanded just 5.5%. And France's recovery since the crisis owes much to rising government spending, which stood at 57% of GDP in 2012, versus 45% in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German unemployment peaked in early 2005 and is now at record-low levels just over 5%. French unemployment, meanwhile, has risen to 10.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs of a structural deterioration in France's labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Beveridge curve, which tracks the relationship between unemployment and vacancies, has shifted in the wrong direction, economist Hetal Mehta at <span class="companylink">Legal &amp; General Investment Management</span> points out. For a given level of vacancies, unemployment is now higher in France than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the big four euro-zone economies, France is the only one where labor-market regulation has increased, rather than decreased, since 1990, <span class="companylink">Legal &amp; General</span> notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany is running a balanced budget, while the <span class="companylink">European Commission</span> may have to demand more fiscal action from France.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The willingness of the euro zone to force France to comply with strict new budget rules will be an important test of the postcrisis architecture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one indicator that has moved in Mr. Hollande's favor has been French bond yields versus Germany. But the credit for that can be put more at the door of the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> and strong technical factors that have supported demand for French debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hollande sounds like a man who has started to grasp the scale of the problem, pledging to cut spending and taxes. Yet in coming months, France may not only fall further behind Germany, it also may start to look like a laggard compared with Spain and Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given how deep the problems lie, it will take more than fiscal tweaking to turn France around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Richard Barley</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing Out China's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish Economy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard for China's economy to gain steam in a sea of falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese consumer prices rose at their slowest pace in 18 months in April, while producer prices fell 2% compared with a year earlier and have now contracted every month for more than two years. Falling commodity prices globally and subdued vegetable and pork prices are easy scapegoats. Industrial overcapacity and sluggish income growth are more worrying explanations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever is causing the lack of inflation, it is hard for companies to increase profits when they can't raise prices. In the first quarter, profits at nonfinancial listed companies on the mainland rose just 3.9% year over year, a sharp slowdown from the 17.7% pace of the final quarter of 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</span>. The lack of producer-price increases is particularly painful for the overleveraged mining sector, in which falling prices make it harder to cover debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger worry is that property prices will be the next to take a fall. Average home prices rose just 0.1% in April compared with a month earlier, according to data provider China Real Estate Index Systems. Many fear this all-important sector, a big driver of the overall economy, is nearing a troubling tipping point of falling prices and overcapacity. Excavator sales, a proxy for construction activity, fell 19% in April from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports are showing modest signs of life. Container throughput at China's 10 biggest ports rose 7% in April from a year earlier, according to data provider Chineseport.cn, the fastest this year. Still, that is hardly the pace needed for exports to carry the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is what policy makers will do about it. Beijing is reluctant to loosen credit by lowering bank reserve requirements or interest rates for fear the money will flow to overleveraged sectors such as property and coal mining. If there is such a loosening, it would signal that the government's concerns about growth have intensified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main relief valve seems to be a weaker yuan; Beijing has allowed the currency to fall nearly 3% against the dollar this year. That isn't a huge boost to competitiveness, but it's a marked change for companies that have endured a stronger yuan each of the past four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, a stronger currency was used to stem inflation by lowering the price of imports, especially commodities. So long as price pressures lag behind, so too could the yuan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple Tries a New Beat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how you slice it, the possibility of Apple dropping $3.2 billion to purchase <span class="companylink">Beats Electronics</span> shows the tech giant is now singing a different tune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple can easily afford the reported price tag for a company that sells pricey headphones alongside a nascent music streaming service. But this latest break with a long-established modus operandi will require an explanation to investors, some of whom have become concerned that the company's best days may be behind it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And explaining itself has never been Apple's strong suit, especially when it comes to acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little is known about Apple's reported talks to buy Beats, especially the rationale. Like Apple, Beats has been wildly successful at creating a new category or, more accurately, blowing up an old one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The premium headphone segment was limited to wealthy audiophiles before Beats came on the scene in 2008 with its $400 headphones branded by co-founder Dr. Dre. Against conventional wisdom, the category exploded, making up sales of more than $1 billion last year in the U.S. alone, with Beats's market share at more than 60%, according to data from NPD.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beats has tried to parlay that success into streaming music, buying the Mog service in 2012 and relaunching it as Beats Music this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has struggled to make a dent against larger rivals like Spotify and <span class="companylink">Pandora Media</span>. Neither Spotify nor Beats discloses financial figures. Notably, though, Pandora reported gains in both listeners and listener hours in the most recent quarter, coinciding with Beats Music's launch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple's investors must be scratching their heads at the news. Even a high-margin business like Beats would have little impact on Apple's profit; accessories made up only 3% of its revenue in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying Beats could be about adding a new streaming service to iTunes. But competition remains intense, and it isn't clear how a new music offering would help Apple boost sales of its hardware, especially when it already offers a similar service in iTunes Radio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is clear is that Apple is now a very different company, one that is willing to go outside and spend big for new products or talent or, perhaps strangest of all, brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In relative terms, Beats wouldn't actually be at the same level as the 1996 acquisition of Next that brought Steve Jobs back to Apple. That deal, at $400 million, represented about 23% of Apple's cash at a time when the company was actually losing money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At about 2% of reported cash for a highly profitable Apple, a Beats deal would be far less risky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Beats talks have come at a time when Apple is under pressure to prove it can still innovate. In that sense, it is a high-risk gamble with Apple's reputation in the stock market. Investors have run Apple's stock up 10% in the past two weeks, betting it still has its mojo. Left-field moves like a Beats deal could easily be read the other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Dan Gallagher</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Stocks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get Taste</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Yields</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a tough year for many developed stock markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 is up just 1.6%, while the Stoxx Europe 600 has gained 3.1%, and it has been a bumpy ride. But, propelled by a renewed search for yield in an uncertain growth environment, stocks with relatively high dividends are faring well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equation for high-dividend stocks isn't as obvious as a couple of years ago, when aggregate dividend yields were above <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields. That prompted many investors to embrace bond-like stocks with chunky payouts. Their ardor dimmed when the Federal Reserve last May started talking about trimming bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And long-term debt yields since then have climbed. The MSCI World index of developed-market stocks had a dividend yield of 2.49% at the end of April versus 2.65% for 10-year Treasurys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, by historical standards, that is a small gap. For much of the period since 1980, Treasurys have offered yields far in excess of stock payouts. What is more, developed-market dividend yields are little changed from their 10-year average, while yields on fixed-income securities are below that watermark, <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent market moves suggest a newfound appreciation for quality dividend stocks, those that offer decent dividends with an ability to maintain and increase payouts over time. The MSCI World High Dividend Yield index has outshone the MSCI World index this year, rising 5.8% versus 2.5% to the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, one issue for dividend hunters is which stocks to pick. One approach is to use signals from the credit markets to determine whether dividends are sustainable, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> suggests. Analysts there screen for large companies with high dividend yields, the ability to increase dividends, and low credit-default-swap rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, dividends drive long-term shareholder performance. From 1970 to 2012, the dividend yield accounted for about two-thirds of real stock-market returns in major markets, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the market appears to forget that in its enthusiasm for the prospect of large price appreciation. But with fixed-income yields so suppressed, high-dividend stocks still are worth a close look.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanda McDaniel and her husband, Al Ruddy, are a quintessential Hollywood power couple: He's a producer of films "The Godfather" and "Million Dollar Baby"; she's a top executive at <span class="companylink">Giorgio Armani</span>. They live in Los Angeles' Benedict Canyon, in a midcentury modern house filled with contemporary art and movie memorabilia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the couple bought a vacation home last summer, they chose her hometown of Macon, Mo., population 5,471.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I love my hometown, and I want to have a place to go home to," Ms. McDaniel said. After learning from a lifelong friend that a historic, 10,000-square-foot estate on 36 acres was being offered in a foreclosure sale, they called the agent and bought it sight unseen for $450,000. They are now renovating the home's eight bedrooms and 11½ bathrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 717,000 vacation-property purchases last year, 30% more than the year prior, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. As vacation-home buying picks up again, some buyers are eschewing traditional upscale enclaves in favor of homes deeply entwined with their childhoods. The nostalgic impulse isn't lost on real-estate agents, some of whom use desire for a piece of the past as their main marketing tool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would say at least 30% of our clients are people who have a childhood connection here," said Christina Clemans, broker-owner at Chris Clemans Sotheby's International Realty in Cape May, N.J. When house-hunters ask her to score them a specific house they have admired since childhood, Ms. Clemans uses their fantasy as a guide to their taste.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You take that perfect little Victorian that might never turn up on the market and see if you can find others that are," Ms. Clemans said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mackinac Island, Mich., nearly half of all buyers are people who "had some experiences as youngsters on the island," said Bill Borst of Mackinac Island Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers with nostalgic memories of childhood find that "things have not changed here much," said Mr. Borst. There are no cars on the island and people get around by bicycle and horse-and-buggy. Most houses start around $400,000 and go up to about $4 million, Mr. Borst said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hunt for out-of-the-way nostalgic homes comes as some traditional vacation-home markets get pricier. Prices per-square-foot in Miami Beach are up 13% from last year, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate website. Aspen and New York's Hamptons are up by 6.6% and 6.7%, respectively. Markets throughout the West Coast and Florida have reinflated so dramatically, Trulia categorizes many of them as "overvalued," relative to local incomes and historical prices, while many markets throughout the South and Midwest are classified by the site as "undervalued."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, parts of California, Arizona and Florida have been "pretty-well picked over" for bargains by investors, foreign buyers and second-home seekers, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, a real estate website. Prices in the states in the middle and upper parts of the country remain soft enough to attract the eye of investors and bargain-hunting second-home buyers, Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For John Shiely, 61, retired chief executive of engine company <span class="companylink">Briggs &amp; Stratton</span>, the pull of Prescott, Wis., went beyond price: He spent part of nearly every summer of his life in the St. Croix river town, about a five-hour drive from his main home in Milwaukee. Mr. Shiely and his wife, Helen Pauly Shiely, recently purchased and rebuilt a home that Mr. Shiely's own great-grandfather, a carpenter from Switzerland, built for another family in the 1920s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We used to peek in the windows of the house when it was vacant," for several years, said Ms. Pauly Shiely. When Mr. Shiely's cousin tipped them off that it was for sale, the couple grabbed it for $299,000 in 2010. The house was in such disrepair, the couple had to tear it down and rebuild. They salvaged as many elements of the old home as they could, including a stone wall, a cupola and weather vane, and a 1930s <span class="companylink">General Electric</span> refrigerator, which they rebuilt into a liquor cabinet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we built something of our own but that captures the essence of the location and of my great-grandfather's architecture," Mr. Shiely said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McDaniel also has intimate history with her Macon house. Built by an early telephone entrepreneur in 1928, Oakhill was the nicest estate in town when Ms. McDaniel was growing up. She spent pledge night for her college sorority there, and her sister spent her honeymoon there when the house functioned as a bed-and-breakfast, she said. Ms. McDaniel and Mr. Ruddy plan to vacation in Macon and eventually spend more time there in retirement, Ms. McDaniel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nostalgia motivated David Hernandez and his wife Tereasa Surratt to buy the 25-acre camp where Mr. Hernandez spent summers in his youth. The same emotion has helped turn their vacation property into a marketing phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Camp Wandawega, in Elkhorn, Wis., about 90 miles north of Chicago, was for years run by the Catholic church primarily for Latvian immigrants. Its origins are racier: It was originally built in 1925 as a site for prostitution and illicit liquor sales during Prohibition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hernandez and Ms. Surratt, both advertising executives at <span class="companylink">Ogilvy &amp; Mather</span> in Chicago, bought the camp for around $400,000 in derelict condition in 2004. They spent years slowly restoring the property, filling it with flea market finds—from teacups to tennis rackets to canoe paddles—made from 1925 to the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friends and family helped fill the 65 rooms across eight structures during the summer, though the couple never installed air conditioning or televisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We bought it because we wanted to save it, with absolutely no financial plan. It was basically like our summer home," said Ms. Surratt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gradually, however, word of their rustic retreat spread and the couple began renting the camp out for corporate retreats and weddings. They use the income to pay for charitable events, including a weekly church service and free camp activities for the community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Camp Wandawega was listed in Travel &amp; Leisure's book of World's Greatest Hotels—despite the fact that before booking, clients are required to read the camp's "Manifesto of Low Expectations," which warns that the "warm body sleeping next to you might be a chipmunk" and there are toads in the showers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple donates the camp to charitable causes for half the season; the rest of the time, the entire site rents for about $20,000 per weekend. It has been used by companies including Anthropologie and Banana Republic for a corporate retreat and a social media event, respectively. Individual cabins start at $550 a night. Weekends for the four-month season are nearly completely booked out by June, Ms. Surratt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers don't balk at paying steep fees for a taste of Mr. Hernandez's Latvian childhood, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is an opportunity to go back in time. It puts you in touch with your inner child," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jon Hilsenrath and Nick Timiraos   </div><div>779 words</div><div>8 May 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials are seeing a long-awaited spring revival in economic growth -- marked by increased business hiring and consumer spending -- but they have become concerned in recent weeks that the housing sector is missing from the upturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In testimony before Congress's Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economy was on track for "solid growth" in the current quarter after a harsh winter that temporarily crimped business activity. But she held out housing as a potentially more lasting problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing slowdown that became evident late in 2013 shows few signs of reversing. Existing home sales in March fell for the seventh time in eight months and were 7.5% below the seasonally adjusted annual rate of a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building permits for single-family homes stood below the year-earlier level for the second straight month in March. Sales of new homes during the first quarter were 1.8% below the year-earlier level, punctuated by a 13% decline in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recent flattening out in housing activity could prove more protracted than currently expected, rather than resuming its earlier pace of recovery," Ms. Yellen warned lawmakers, expressing an uncertainty about housing she hadn't stated before. The development, she said, "will bear watching."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If housing fails to revive as expected and holds back the broader recovery, Fed officials could decide to take even more time on an already slow path to eventual interest-rate increases. The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008 in an effort to stabilize the financial system and boost growth by spurring more spending, hiring and investment. The central bank amplified this approach with purchases of long-term mortgage and Treasury bonds to drive long-term rates lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Encouraged by signs of a broad economic pickup, Fed officials agreed at a policy meeting last week to keep gradually reducing the bond purchases. At the same time, the Fed signaled there was no change in its plan to keep short-term interest rates near zero for many more months. Most Fed officials don't expect to raise short-term rates until 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yellen has warned the Fed's interest-rate calculus will change if the economy veers from its expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's interest-rate policies are an important part of the housing puzzle. Mortgage rates on the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 4.6% last June, from 3.6% in early May, after then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted at looming reductions in bond purchases. The rate increase coincided with home-inventory shortages that gave sellers more power to ask for higher prices, crimping housing affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say the affordability squeeze led buyers to step back from the market. But the effect of higher mortgage rates on housing activity typically fades after three to four quarters, according to research from economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. If that is right, then the effects of last year's rate increase "should finally be behind us" by the summer, said Goldman economist Hui Shan in a report Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everyone panicked" last summer, said Steve Capen, a real-estate agent in St. Petersburg, Fla. "But rates have been sitting there for a while now. Everyone's adjusted to it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a gloomier scenario. Some analysts have warned that the market's health had been overstated by a sudden but short-lived release of pent-up demand from traditional buyers last spring, coupled with aggressive purchases by investors soaking up a glut of distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These analysts argue that broader economic problems could hold housing back, including the failure of younger households to strike out on their own because their incomes are uneven and they have high debt loads. Continued tight credit standards have made it harder for these marginal buyers to obtain mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are approaching the slowdown warily. In several parts of the country with inventory shortages, builders have been slow to ramp up construction. Some of them are focusing narrowly on building fewer homes that can fetch high prices, catering sales to affluent buyers who have fared better during the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As we increased our prices. . .over the last couple of years, we've depleted that pool of the first-time home buyer," said Donald Tomnitz, chief executive of <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>., the nation's largest home builder, in a call with analysts two weeks ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The chief operating officer of the Federal Housing Finance Agency faces a felony charge after he allegedly made violent threats concerning the regulator's former director, according to a police report and court records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Hornsby, the agency's chief operating officer, was charged last Wednesday with one felony count of threatening to kidnap or injure a person, court records show. He was ordered to stay away from the FHFA and from former director Edward DeMarco, who retired from the agency last week, court documents state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA is the regulator of mortgage companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hornsby didn't respond to requests for comment, including messages left on a cellphone and a visit to his apartment. A woman who answered the phone at a California number associated with his name hung up when informed the caller was from The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeMarco declined to comment Tuesday. An FHFA spokeswoman said the agency wouldn't comment on personnel matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hornsby allegedly threatened to shoot Mr. DeMarco after making increasingly threatening comments about him for several weeks, according to court records and a Metropolitan Police Department report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FHFA officials notified the agency's inspector general about the threats on April 28, after an incident at the agency's headquarters in which Mr. DeMarco was "escorted to a secure location following a report of a threat," the court document said. An FHFA employee, who wasn't named in the report filed in court, said Mr. Hornsby had threatened to harm Mr. DeMarco and to kill himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident occurred two days before Mr. DeMarco's previously announced retirement from the agency. The unnamed FHFA employee told the inspector general that the threats against Mr. DeMarco stemmed from disputes about Mr. Hornsby's job performance ratings, the court document stated. A spokeswoman for the inspector general declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a D.C. Superior Court hearing last Wednesday, Judge Karen Howze issued the restraining order directing Mr. Hornsby to stay away from his workplace and from Mr. DeMarco, court records said. Mr. Hornsby, 58 years old, was released without being required to post bond. Another hearing in the case is set for May 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees were notified last Wednesday that Mr. Hornsby had been placed on leave, according to an email sent by agency Director Mel Watt and reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Hornsby joined the FHFA in November 2011 after 26 years at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeMarco served as the agency's acting director from August 2009 until this past January. He previously had announced that he would stay at the agency until April 30 as a senior adviser to Mr. Watt, a former North Carolina congressman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Wednesday's notice, Mr. Watt told employees that Mr. Hornsby's duties would be assumed for now by Eric Stein, a former Treasury Department official who was brought on board by Mr. Watt in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications Richard Hornsby is the chief operating officer of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In an earlier version of this story that appeared online, he was erroneously identified as the chief executive officer in a headline. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan to pay for Brooklyn Bridge Park through condominium development is yielding a bonus for the prominent builder of the luxury homes as sales shatter Brooklyn records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, developer <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> was awarded a lease by the city on a prime parcel of park land hugging the shoreline in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, with dramatic water views across to lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan, opposed by some park activists, planners and elected officials, was to use lease payments and other payments from condo buyers and make the 85-acre park self-sustaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Toll Brothers' bet is paying off. Since Pierhouse at Brooklyn Bridge Park went on the market in late February, it has set a series of records for Brooklyn condo sales, according to David Von Spreckelsen, president of Toll Brothers City Living Division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In about 10 weeks, more than 40 of the 108 condominiums under construction have gone into contract. They have moved at an unusually fast pace for a new condominium at an average price of $1,800 a square foot, a record for Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is more than 25% higher than the developer projected last fall for the property. Since the launch, prices have been raised six times to a total of $503.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the weekend, a buyer signed a contract to pay $11.18 million for a four-bedroom penthouse with more than 5,000 square feet of space, plus a 3,400-square-foot garden and patio. That price would make it a record condominium sale in Brooklyn, said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead Property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher valuation of the building could eventually translate into higher property-tax revenues that will go toward the benefit of the park. Even before any increase in assessment, Toll Brothers says that by mid-2016 each apartment will pay an average of about $500 in lease payments and more than $2,200 in property taxes a month to support the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But opponents of condominium development in the park say the high prices achieved by Toll Brothers raise questions about whether the city had undervalued the park land and whether it should have been used for housing at all. City property records show the park turned the land over in 2012 to Toll Brothers for $42.5 million under a 97-year lease in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is yet another reason we shouldn't put any more housing in Brooklyn Bridge Park," said state Sen. Daniel Squadron, a Brooklyn Democrat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Kent, president of the Project for Public Spaces, a nonprofit planning group, said the strong sales by Toll Brothers weren't a surprise but nonetheless represented a mistake. Without the need to create a "pleasant place for people who live along the waterfront," he said, the park could have been designed to serve "people who live in inner Brooklyn."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of Brooklyn elected officials have joined Mr. Squadron to urge Mayor Bill de Blasio to drop plans from the Bloomberg administration to build two additional residential towers in the park. Instead, they argued that the park should be paid for from increased taxes in the neighborhood due to new construction and higher valuations outside the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. de Blasio has long supported using development to pay for the park and reiterated his support on Monday. "The mayor has been a long-standing supporter of Brooklyn Bridge Park and sees this model as critical to the park's long-term financial sustainability," said Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for the mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierhouse consists of two buildings on both sides of a 450-long pedestrian bridge that begins at Squibb Park in Brooklyn Heights and descends to the new Brooklyn Bridge Park below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condos, designed by Marvel Architects, have large windows facing the water and include landscaped terraces designed to echo landscaping in the park in front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One building is four stories. The other is 10 stories and includes a 192-room hotel, to be operated as a 1 Hotel, a brand of <span class="companylink">Starwood Capital Group</span>. Starwood and Toll Brothers are partners on the entire project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Von Spreckelsen said that about half the buyers to date already lived in the neighborhood. </p>

</div><div class="author">By AnnaMaria Andriotis   </div><div>2127 words</div><div>3 May 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home has long been part of the American dream. But rising prices have made renting less expensive in many places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People often aspire to own a home for reasons that have little to do with money, and rental options are limited in some communities. Yet owning property can limit your flexibility to move when you want and ties up a lot of your money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of existing single-family homes rose 11.4% in 2013 from the previous year -- the highest yearly increase since 2005, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Prices in many places, including Los Angeles, Baltimore and Portland, Ore., rose even more last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly cost of renting was lower than buying in 20 large metropolitan areas at the end of last year, the most recent period for which data are available, according to figures provided exclusively to The Wall Street Journal by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. That is up from 15 large metropolitan areas a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank calculates the costs in 54 markets based on average local rents and median home-sale prices, which it uses to estimate monthly mortgage payments for a hypothetical buyer in the 25% federal income-tax bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting had been less expensive than buying on average across all the areas <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> tracks since at least the early 1990s. But that changed during the financial crisis, as home prices plummeted and interest rates on mortgages dropped. The current rally in home prices appears to be pushing the housing market back toward the historical norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five markets where renting recently became cheaper than buying include some popular cities and suburbs where home prices are climbing fastest: Sacramento, Calif.; Phoenix; San Bernardino and Riverside, Calif.; Austin, Texas; and Northern Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying is still cheaper in 34 metropolitan areas <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> examined, including Cleveland, Chicago and Atlanta, though prices rose last year in those areas, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting has become more appealing financially than it was at the end of 2012 in places such as St. Louis; Orlando, Fla.; and Minneapolis, though buyers still pay much less than renters in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buying advantage was slight in some places. Miami, San Antonio and Las Vegas are among the hot markets where renters appeared to be on the verge of being better off than buyers at year-end, according to the bank's figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, of course, can build up equity as they pay down a mortgage, which can compensate for higher monthly costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is what you need to know to help figure out the most cost-effective way to keep a roof over your head. The first step is to understand the arguments in favor of buying and renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case for Buying</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans see buying a home as an essential step in a successful life, and owning one can bring significant financial benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious upside is that a home can significantly increase in value. The median sales price of existing single-family homes rose 81% from 1993 through 2013, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential payoff can loom large in a buyer's mind when home prices are going up rapidly, as they have recently. "We've already seen six to seven years of normal appreciation in the last 12 months" in many markets, says Jack McCabe, an independent housing analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners also can deduct mortgage interest from their income-tax bills along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, homeowners can tap into the equity in their homes for big-ticket expenses, such as college tuition, at interest rates that can be lower than other financing options -- though that can backfire by saddling homeowners with debt they can't easily repay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners also don't have to worry about a spike in rents. Jacquelyn Bilton, who is 34 years old, bought a three-bedroom home with a pool in Margate, Fla., in February for $200,000, after her landlord raised her rent 28% last year. She says her monthly housing costs are now about $300 lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't afford to be throwing money down the drain in rent when I could purchase a home," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they age, homeowners can enjoy another benefit. If they pay off their mortgages around the time they retire, their housing costs can drop significantly just when they may want extra cash for travel, medical expenses and the like, says Chris Mayer, research director at the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the dream also can turn into a financial nightmare. The collapse of the housing market starting in 2008, which triggered millions of foreclosures, is a vivid recent example of what can go wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, owning a home can be well worth it for personal and psychological reasons that go beyond financial calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case for Renting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the wide array of potential benefits, homeowners are sometimes surprised to learn that buying isn't always the smartest financial option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, the monthly cost of renting can be lower, even for a home of similar size and quality in the same community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters, for example, don't pay property taxes, homeowner's insurance and, in most cases, maintenance costs. These expenses can cost homeowners about 3% of the price of their home annually, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those costs can be folded into monthly rent, apartment renters often pay a smaller share as landlords spread the costs among many tenants, says Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, director of the Center for Real Estate Finance Research at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. If a window breaks or the toilet plugs up, your landlord -- not you -- pays for the repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters don't end up with a valuable asset, as buyers do when they pay off a mortgage. But renters might be able to make more money by investing the monthly savings, as well as the cash they would otherwise use for a down payment, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the average single-family home increased by 3.6% a year in the three decades through 2013, compounded annually, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. By contrast, the compound annual return on the S&amp;P 500 over that period was 11.1%, according to Chicago-based investment-research firm Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After moving to New York two years ago, Hunter Kearney, 27, looked into buying a condominium worth at least $2 million. But Mr. Kearney, an executive at a firm that sells graphite, concluded that renting a similar apartment was significantly less expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Your monthly costs end up being lower," says Mr. Kearney, who says he saves about $2,000 a month over the cost of buying. He is investing some of the savings in the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters often have greater flexibility to move to a different part of the country, which can be important in a weak job market. They may feel freer to look for work in another city, and they don't have to wait to sell their home if the right opportunity opens up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices don't need to decline as severely as they did during the financial crisis to cost homeowners significant sums, if they need to sell during a downturn. Modest declines in home prices are common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even people who want to own a home at some point can benefit from renting for a while to save up for a larger down payment. If the available inventory is thin, they can rent while they wait for a wider variety of homes to be listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Handling a Hot Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To calculate whether buying or renting makes more sense financially, you need to have a sense of your monthly costs in each case, including rent, mortgage payments, taxes, insurance and other related expenses that may apply to each option -- as well as whether you would be more likely to spend or invest any savings from renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The verdict could differ considerably within a city, suburb or town, based on the location and the style and size of the homes you are exploring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> data reflect an attempt to do that math across metropolitan areas, and essentially function as a general guide to each market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be buyers should proceed carefully. First, they should try to get a sense of how hot the local real-estate market is and whether buyers generally still have the upper hand, which is often the case far from the coasts and outside large cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are in a more-competitive market, be alert to the risk that you could end up in a bidding war that could drive up the purchase price. Being patient could pay off if prices cool down. In fact, slight corrections already have occurred in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco's East Bay area, for example, asking prices of some new homes declined 1% to 5% during the second half of last year, after builders raised prices by 5% to 18% in the prior quarter, according to Metrostudy, a housing research and consulting firm based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene and Erin Lash plan to sell their home in Danville, Calif., and are prepared to spend $1 million to $2 million on a larger house. But the couple has faced as many as 30 competing offers on each of the five homes they bid on and lost out every time, says Mr. Lash, a 48-year-old forensic accountant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Lashes are also looking into renting a single-family home or an apartment as a short-term alternative to buying. "Everything is on the table," Mr. Lash says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a hot market, the math can be more advantageous for buyers who plan to stay put for a while, typically at least five to seven years. That should be enough time for market corrections to pass, says Landon Nash, a real-estate agent in San Francisco with national brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nash says he is telling would-be buyers in his area who plan to sell in fewer than five years that they run significant risk of selling at a loss. "We're at the top of the market," he says. "They might be better off as renters."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calculating the Monthly Cost of Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine whether buying or renting a home is cheaper, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> calculates the average monthly rent as a percentage of the estimated monthly mortgage payment in each of 54 metropolitan areas over the course of a three-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rents are for apartments, as reported by Reis, a New York-based real-estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimated mortgage payments are based on median sale prices in the same period, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The bank adjusts the estimates to reflect the tax deduction for mortgage interest. It also figures the typical homeowner pays 0.4% of the home's cost on insurance each year, and 1.5% of the cost on property tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the resulting percentage is above 100%, buying is more favorable financially. If the percentage is below 100%, renting is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most favorable of the 54 metropolitan areas to be a buyer in last year's fourth quarter was Cleveland, at 155%. That means for every $1 a new buyer spent in Cleveland, a new renter spent $1.55.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the most favorable place to be a renter was Oakland-East Bay, Calif., at 49%, meaning for every $1 a buyer spent, a renter spent $0.49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> assumes buyers take out a 30-year mortgage with a 5% down payment. The bank also assumes buyers are in the 25% federal income-tax bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> uses the average interest rate on one of the most affordable mortgages, which comes with an interest rate that is fixed for one year and then adjusts annually, which tends to make buying look more favorable generally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage that most borrowers take out carries an interest rate that is more than one percentage point higher on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing the assumptions can make renting or buying look more favorable. For example, a buyer who is in a higher tax bracket or who makes a larger down payment would be in a stronger position. But if a buyer had to pay a higher interest rate on a mortgage, renters would be relatively better off.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home has long been part of the American dream. But rising prices have made renting less expensive in many places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People often aspire to own a home for reasons that have little to do with money, and rental options are limited in some communities. Yet owning property can limit your flexibility to move when you want and ties up a lot of your money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of existing single-family homes rose 11.4% in 2013 from the previous year—the highest yearly increase since 2005, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Prices in many places, including Los Angeles, Baltimore and Portland, Ore., rose even more last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly cost of renting was lower than buying in 20 large metropolitan areas at the end of last year, the most recent period for which data are available, according to figures provided exclusively to The Wall Street Journal by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. That is up from 15 large metropolitan areas a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank calculates the costs in 54 markets based on average local rents and median home-sale prices, which it uses to estimate monthly mortgage payments for a hypothetical buyer in the 25% federal income-tax bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting had been less expensive than buying on average across all the areas Deutsche Bank tracks since at least the early 1990s. But that changed during the financial crisis, as home prices plummeted and interest rates on mortgages dropped. The current rally in home prices appears to be pushing the housing market back toward the historical norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five markets where renting recently became cheaper than buying include some popular cities and suburbs where home prices are climbing fastest: Sacramento, Calif.; Phoenix; San Bernardino and Riverside, Calif.; Austin, Texas; and Northern Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying is still cheaper in 34 metropolitan areas Deutsche Bank examined, including Cleveland, Chicago and Atlanta, though prices rose last year in those areas, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting has become more appealing financially than it was at the end of 2012 in places such as St. Louis; Orlando, Fla.; and Minneapolis, though buyers still pay much less than renters in those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buying advantage was slight in some places. Miami, San Antonio and Las Vegas are among the hot markets where renters appeared to be on the verge of being better off than buyers at year-end, according to the bank's figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, of course, can build up equity as they pay down a mortgage, which can compensate for higher monthly costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is what you need to know to help figure out the most cost-effective way to keep a roof over your head. The first step is to understand the arguments in favor of buying and renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case for Buying</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans see buying a home as an essential step in a successful life, and owning one can bring significant financial benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious upside is that a home can significantly increase in value. The median sales price of existing single-family homes rose 81% from 1993 through 2013, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The potential payoff can loom large in a buyer's mind when home prices are going up rapidly, as they have recently. "We've already seen six to seven years of normal appreciation in the last 12 months" in many markets, says Jack McCabe, an independent housing analyst in Deerfield Beach, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners also can deduct mortgage interest from their income-tax bills along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, homeowners can tap into the equity in their homes for big-ticket expenses, such as college tuition, at interest rates that can be lower than other financing options—though that can backfire by saddling homeowners with debt they can't easily repay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners also don't have to worry about a spike in rents. Jacquelyn Bilton, who is 34 years old, bought a three-bedroom home with a pool in Margate, Fla., in February for $200,000, after her landlord raised her rent 28% last year. She says her monthly housing costs are now about $300 lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't afford to be throwing money down the drain in rent when I could purchase a home," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they age, homeowners can enjoy another benefit. If they pay off their mortgages around the time they retire, their housing costs can drop significantly just when they may want extra cash for travel, medical expenses and the like, says Chris Mayer, research director at the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the dream also can turn into a financial nightmare. The collapse of the housing market starting in 2008, which triggered millions of foreclosures, is a vivid recent example of what can go wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, owning a home can be well worth it for personal and psychological reasons that go beyond financial calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case for Renting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the wide array of potential benefits, homeowners are sometimes surprised to learn that buying isn't always the smartest financial option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, the monthly cost of renting can be lower, even for a home of similar size and quality in the same community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters, for example, don't pay property taxes, homeowner's insurance and, in most cases, maintenance costs. These expenses can cost homeowners about 3% of the price of their home annually, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those costs can be folded into monthly rent, apartment renters often pay a smaller share as landlords spread the costs among many tenants, says Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, director of the Center for Real Estate Finance Research at <span class="companylink">New York University</span>. If a window breaks or the toilet plugs up, your landlord—not you—pays for the repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters don't end up with a valuable asset, as buyers do when they pay off a mortgage. But renters might be able to make more money by investing the monthly savings, as well as the cash they would otherwise use for a down payment, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of the average single-family home increased by 3.6% a year in the three decades through 2013, compounded annually, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. By contrast, the compound annual return on the S&amp;P 500 over that period was 11.1%, according to Chicago-based investment-research firm Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After moving to New York two years ago, Hunter Kearney, 27, looked into buying a condominium worth at least $2 million. But Mr. Kearney, an executive at a firm that sells graphite, concluded that renting a similar apartment was significantly less expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Your monthly costs end up being lower," says Mr. Kearney, who says he saves about $2,000 a month over the cost of buying. He is investing some of the savings in the stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters often have greater flexibility to move to a different part of the country, which can be important in a weak job market. They may feel freer to look for work in another city, and they don't have to wait to sell their home if the right opportunity opens up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices don't need to decline as severely as they did during the financial crisis to cost homeowners significant sums, if they need to sell during a downturn. Modest declines in home prices are common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even people who want to own a home at some point can benefit from renting for a while to save up for a larger down payment. If the available inventory is thin, they can rent while they wait for a wider variety of homes to be listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Handling a Hot Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To calculate whether buying or renting makes more sense financially, you need to have a sense of your monthly costs in each case, including rent, mortgage payments, taxes, insurance and other related expenses that may apply to each option—as well as whether you would be more likely to spend or invest any savings from renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The verdict could differ considerably within a city, suburb or town, based on the location and the style and size of the homes you are exploring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the global luxury real-estate scene, is Lagos poised to be the next big thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nigerian city is among a list of 12 up-and-coming luxury markets around the globe, according to a new report from Savills World Research, in cooperation with design firm Candy &amp; Candy and <span class="companylink">Deutsche</span> Asset and Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other cities are Beirut, Cape Town, Chennai, Chicago, Dublin, Istanbul, Jakarta, Melbourne, Miami, Panama City and Tel Aviv. The most expensive city is Tel Aviv, where an entry-level, two-bedroom luxury apartment typically cost $1.45 million in March; the least expensive was India's Chennai, where a luxury two-bedroom cost around $160,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report considered economic factors, such as job-market potential and gross domestic product, but also a number of qualitative aspects, like cultural attractions and the presence of English as a first or second language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, there were nearly 200,000 people world-wide with wealth exceeding $30 million, according to the Wealth-X &amp; <span class="companylink">UBS</span> World Ultra Wealth Report. As prices continue to rise in prime markets like New York, London and Hong Kong, Yolande Barnes, director of Savills World Research, predicts that luxury buyers will increasingly look to less mature markets for better value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cities run the gamut, from well-established markets like Melbourne and Tel Aviv, which have yet to reach their full investment potential, the report notes, to developing markets like Chennai and Lagos, which may have larger returns but more risk for buyers. "You have to look at the political risk," said Nick Candy, CEO of Candy &amp; Candy, noting that unpredictable currency exchange and ownership hurdles for foreigners in some markets might dissuade some buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tel Aviv, the Manhattan Tower attracts cosmopolitan buyers, says Tomer Fridman, CEO of Israel <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. "Ten to 15 years ago, there wasn't an international product," he said. Today, the 10,000-square-foot penthouse in the tower is listed for $25 million. He credits the city's thriving tech industry and interest from Europeans, among others, for the surge in foreign buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other markets on the list are similar to Panama City. The Central American hub is poised for rapid growth thanks to a mix of foreign investment and government policies that benefit international buyers, said Andrea Kam, a consultant for real-estate brokerage Bonavivi in Panama City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global recession hit some markets on the list particularly hard, but the report says home prices are rebounding. In Dublin, for example, inventory is tightening and demand is rising, said Graham Murray, head of residential for Savills in Dublin.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kathleen Madigan </div><div>394 words</div><div>29 April 2014</div><div>05:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices across the U.S. increased in the year ended in February, although the momentum is easing, according to a report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 13.1% in the year ended in February. Case-Shiller's 20-city price index advanced 12.9%, less than the 13.1% expected by economists and down from 13.4% for all of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, both the 10-city and 20-city indexes were unchanged in February over January. Seasonally adjusted, the 10-city index was up 0.9%, while the 20-city measure increased 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices help the economy by promoting more home building and increasing wealth for existing homeowners. But the surge in prices seen for more than a year is easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The annual rates cooled the most we've seen in some time," said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "Moreover, home prices nationally have not made it back to 2005. Mortgage interest rates, which jumped in May last year and are steady since then, are blamed by some analysts for the weakness. Others cite difficulties in qualifying for loans and concerns about consumer confidence. The result is less demand and fewer homes being built."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data follow a mixed performance by other housing indicators. According to the Commerce Department, sales of new homes, which account for a much smaller portion of the overall market than existing homes, tumbled 14.5% in March to their lowest level since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said that its seasonally-adjusted index of pending sales of existing homes rose 3.4% in March from February, a larger increase than economists expected. But that index is still below its 2001 benchmark level, and earlier the Realtors group said its gauge of sales closures for existing homes fell in March for the third consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, Tuesday's Case-Shiller report said, "Denver and Dallas remain the only cities which have reached new postcrisis price peaks. The Northeast with New York, Washington and Boston are seeing some of the slowest year-over-year gains."</p>

</div><div class="author">Min Zeng </div><div>559 words</div><div>28 April 2014</div><div>11:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treasury bond prices fell for the first time in four sessions Monday as a strong U.S. housing report dented the allure of safe-haven bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late-afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year note was 4/32 lower, yielding 2.682%, according to Tradeweb. When bond prices fall, their yields rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year yield serves as a key global benchmark to set long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. It traded at 3.03% at the end of last year, the highest level since July 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors cashed out some chips from the bond market after a report Monday showed a gauge of upcoming home sales rose 3.4% in March, beating the 1% increase forecast by economists. It was the first monthly rise after eight straight months of declines, a sign of improvement in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We suspect the U.S. housing market will continue to trend higher in the coming months, broadly in line with the development of economic activity," said Annalisa Piazza, economist at Newedge Strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, worries over tensions between Ukraine and Russia, which propped up the bond market Friday, appeared to pull back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So far there is no escalation, so the bond market gave up some of the flight to safety rally," said Thomas Roth, executive director in the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span> bond trading group at <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi UFJ Securities</span> (USA) Inc. in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, analysts said investors are keeping an eye on the geopolitical risks and further escalation in Ukraine that would encourage investors to <span class="companylink">seek</span> safety in U.S. government debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond investors face a deluge of economic data this week and the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s two-day policy meeting that is scheduled to end Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mixed bag of data has kept the 10-year note's yield at a tight range of 2.6% and 2.8% since February, after surging more than one percentage point during 2013 on the prospect of reduced bond buying from the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said this week's data, especially Friday's non-farm employment report, could be a catalyst to push the yield out of the trading range if they signal that the U.S. economy is getting out of the winter doldrums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some traders expect the 10-year yield to rise toward 3% if Friday's jobs data suggest the economy's pace of hiring accelerated last month. A disappointing release would send bond yields lower, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the U.S. economy is a key factor influencing the Fed's pace in withdrawing monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> has dialed back its monthly bond-buying program since January. The purchases have helped bond yields stay near historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists widely expect the Fed to reduce the size of its monthly purchases by another $10 billion to $45 billion when it releases the interest-rate statement Wednesday afternoon. It is also expected that the Fed will phase out the bond buying during the fourth quarter of this year, paving the way for a rise in short-term interest rates sometime in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has kept its Fed-funds target rate, the key short-term policy rate for the economy, between zero and 0.25% since December 2008. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real-estate agents call it the "Bacon bounce": Property sales at Taos Ski Valley, a rugged resort with European flair in the mountains of New Mexico, have multiplied since December, when New York hedge fund founder Louis Bacon said he was buying the ski area from a family that has owned it for decades. The deal is raising expectations that long-planned improvements will now happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The announcement gave us the final push," said Peter Trevisani, who spent weekends at Taos Ski Valley for years before he and his wife Wendy bought a contemporary condominium in a Bavarian-style chalet in February. Now the couple uses the condo for weekends with the children, all avid skiers. They are also hoping the modernization of the resort will make it a good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trevisanis, both managing directors at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, paid $750,000 for the 1,951-square-foot, three-bedroom condo, which is nestled between fir trees at 10,200 feet. It combines wood, earth tones and vintage ski advertisements with stainless steel and contemporary furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the condo purchased by the Trevisanis, two more condos in the same development have changed hands since Dec. 13, when Mr. Bacon's intended purchase was disclosed. All three sold at asking price, one for $765,000—higher than most properties on offer at Taos Ski Valley, although still below the original, pre-downturn price of $1.2 million in 2008, when they were built. In all, 11 homes and eight plots of land have changed hands since Dec. 13, compared with two homes and one piece of land in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For two weeks after the deal was announced, the phone rang off the hook," said Keith Dowell, owner of Taos Ski Valley Realty. "It's quite unusual, especially at this time of the year," added Jolie Jones, a real-estate agent with Piñon Investments of Taos who sold the units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The activity comes after a long period of stagnation in the small ski town known for steep chutes, dizzying altitude and grand views across the high desert of northern New Mexico. At the same time, overall vacation home sales have been surging: Earlier this month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said the number of second homes bought for part-time personal use jumped 30% in 2013, the biggest gain in 10 years. The West accounted for 28% of the purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an email, Mr. Bacon said his investment in the resort would be "substantial." "I knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," he said. "Taos Ski Valley is one of the top ski areas in the country." Mr. Bacon, 57, is the founder and Chief Executive of New York-based <span class="companylink">Moore Capital Management</span>, one of the biggest hedge funds in the U.S. with $14.9 billion under management. In 1992, he founded the Moore Charitable Foundation to support nonprofit organizations with a focus on land and water conservation. Mr. Bacon said he owns around 61.5 acres of land in Taos. He said he is an enthusiastic outdoorsman and has skied almost every run at Taos Ski Valley last winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bacon wouldn't say how much he is paying for the resort, which he will own through a private entity. The deal is under contract, with its closing still subject to the transfer of a Forest Service permit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bacon's acquisition ends a family ownership that goes back to 1954, when Ernie Blake, a German immigrant who served as a U.S. military intelligence officer during World War II, flew his plane across the southern Rocky Mountains and spotted an old mining town near a big snow basin. Living in an 11-foot camper with his family, Mr. Blake built a resort that soon found a following for its expert terrain, bone-dry powder and plentiful sunshine. On the way up, skiers pass through the town of Taos, with its adobe houses, Native American Pueblo and a history of eclectic visitors, ranging from Georgia O'Keeffe to D.H. Lawrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a place that has so much more spirit than a purpose-built resort," said Chris Stagg, the late Mr. Blake's son-in-law, ski school director and Vice President of Taos Ski Valley, which locals call TSV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As other resorts were acquired by corporations and modernized, TSV didn't make major improvements. Its lift network was built in 1973. Skiers reach Kachina Peak, the highest point of the Ski Valley, only by hiking up a ridge, carrying their skis. The village looks dated, with a number of buildings from the 1960s and 1970s, and it lacks modern accommodations, spa services and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skier numbers have fallen. This winter, TSV sold 215,000 lift tickets, said Mr. Stagg, down from 220,000 last year and well below the 365,000 tickets sold at the peak in the 1994-95 ski season. Meanwhile, U.S. ski areas reported an 11% year-over-year increase in visitors in the 2012-13 ski season from the year before, the latest figure available from the <span class="companylink">National Ski Areas Association</span>, a Colorado-based trade association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the Blake family drew up a Mountain Development Plan and a Village Master Plan for improvements to the resort. They were approved by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Forest Service</span> and the town, but putting them into action, the Blakes estimated, would require $20 million. Last summer, they contacted Mr. Bacon about a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resort's renovation, Mr. Bacon said, will adhere to the plans, which include two new lifts, one of them to Kachina Peak, mountain bike trails for the summer and a more welcoming base area. Under the plans, the village will keep its European feel and family atmosphere, but offer better access for pedestrians, with a reconfigured parking system and skier drop-off area. The plans also aim to give guests an immediate view of the main lift, now partly obscured by stairs, and a "sense of arrival" that the village now lacks. In addition, there will be new condominiums, as well as restaurants and retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Blake family won't retain any stake in Taos Ski Valley, but Mr. Blake's son, Mickey, will retain a seat on the board of directors, while Mr. Stagg will remain Vice President. Chief Operating Officer Gordon Briner will become Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I see this as a unique opportunity to build a sustainable business over the long-term, and do so by revitalizing the base area and facilities in a way that is consistent with the Blakes' vision, while preserving and protecting a vital natural resource," Mr. Bacon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are limits to how hot the market can get. The town of Taos is planning to build a new, longer airport runway, but for now, the nearest major airport is a three-hour drive south in Albuquerque. Some visitors are deterred by altitude of the resort, where the base is at 9,207 feet. In addition, the Ski Valley is small and has little room for expansion because most of the land is owned by the U.S. Forest Service. Some home buyers prefer to buy in Taos itself, 20 miles south, where it is warmer and sunnier, with more dining and shopping options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now that so many good things are happening at Taos Ski Valley, the challenge is to convince people to buy here, as opposed to the town of Taos," said Jerome de Bontin. A French-born business man who until recently was general manager of the New York Red Bulls soccer team, Mr. de Bontin helped fund the Village Master Plan. With several partners, he plans to redevelop three parcels of land in the base area, including adding a "parking club" where day-use members have showers and valet services. He also plans to develop an upscale hotel and condominiums.</p>

</div><div class="author">Kris Hudson </div><div>859 words</div><div>24 April 2014</div><div>13:53</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many signs point to weaker demand for newly built homes this spring than a year ago, but a few national builders are reporting better financial results partly by relying on continued price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big builders <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ryland Group Inc</span>. on Thursday reported gains in home-sale contracts in the quarter ended March 31 of 9% and 6.6%, respectively, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">PulteGroup Inc</span>. posted a smaller-than-expected decline of 6% as it shifts to building higher-priced homes. The builders posted wider profit margins due mostly to double-digit price increases in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll have to see how demand develops over the remainder of the spring selling season, but we are certainly encouraged by what we saw" in the first quarter, Pulte Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Dugas said on a call with investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, other measures indicate this spring season has started lackadaisically. John Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC in Irvine, Calif., said his firm's survey of 237 home-building executives found a 4% decline in sales contracts in March from a year earlier. He said sales have been hampered by steep price increases in the past year and interest rates that are nearly 1 percentage point higher than last spring, when sales were boosted by relatively lower costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This spring has been a disappointment," Mr. Burns said. "The market should be improving over last year, but it's not. I think rising interest rates have played a role."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> reported that U.S. new-home sales declined by an estimated 13.3% in March from a year earlier. For the first quarter, the Census Bureau estimated a 1.8% decline in sales from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by Zelman &amp; Associates spanning 2,500 new-home communities found that orders declined by 3% in March from a year earlier. Zelman CEO Ivy Zelman said last spring's rapid rebound from the downturn makes this spring appear tepid in comparison, though it actually is solid. "This year, what we're seeing is an improvement in the spring selling season that is more normal, absent the weather," she said, referring to harsh weather that hampered sales in some regions last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divergence among the reports might be attributable to the volatility of the census data, which is subject to large revisions each month. In addition, large, public builders tend to fare better than their smaller, closely held competitors, who lack the larger builders' financial clout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, big builders say the current spring season has hewed to its "normal" patterns in March and April, meaning customer traffic and purchases increased from month to month. PulteGroup, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., noted that its sales in most of its communities increased from last year, though its overall number of contracts declined by 6% because it now is building in fewer communities overall. The builder posted a 10% increase in its average selling price to $317,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.R. Horton, based in Fort Worth, Texas, registered a 9% increase in sales to 8,569 homes and a 10% increase in its average sales price to $278,900. It increased sales incentives—such as free upgrades and financial assistance with closing costs—by a "very slight" amount in the quarter to boost sales, its executives said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, D.R. Horton foresees a shift in the market to include the cash-strapped, first-time buyers previously sidelined due to the high prices and tight mortgage-lending standards of recent years. Thus, the builder is preparing to change gears to construct a greater number of less-expensive homes. On Wednesday, it unveiled a low-cost, no-frills line of homes priced from $120,000 to $150,000 to be built under its new Express brand, initially in four states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we can get that price point down, I truly believe there are people out there who will buy because they've [previously] been priced out of the market," said Donald Tomnitz, D.R. Horton's president and CEO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betsy Meagher, an associate broker at Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International Realty, describes new-home prices in her market of Atlanta's North Buckhead area as "a bit high." She anticipates that builders will need to lower costs as more supply emerges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders and investors are looking for a little more return on their money," she said. "I don't think that can continue."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jake Weaver and his wife, Meredith, both 35 years old, closed on a new, four-bedroom home this month in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven for $763,000. "A couple of years ago, it felt like you had the builders in a squeeze," Mr. Weaver said. "I didn't get that sense this time. The general feeling was that they're doing well enough that they didn't have to be as flexible as they were in the past" on prices and upgrades.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sarah Portlock and Kris Hudson   </div><div>792 words</div><div>24 April 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surge in prices helped drive down sales of newly built homes in March, the latest indication that the housing market is struggling to regain traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 14.5% from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That was the lowest annual rate since last July, though the pace for January and February was revised higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A harsh winter had shut construction sites and softened the housing market in recent months. But the latest data raise the prospect that new-home sales are being hampered by more than rough weather. A sluggish economy and tight lending standards are shutting out first-time buyers, while prices have risen as builders face rising costs and cater to better-heeled shoppers who can qualify for mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home reached $290,000 last month, Commerce said, its highest level ever and a gain of 11.2% from February. The high during last decade's housing boom was $262,600, in March 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales, which represent less than 10% of houses purchased in the U.S., can be subject to large revisions. But the number provides a more timely reading of the market than other gauges because it tallies sales at the moment a contract is signed rather than at closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though March's sales pace was down 13.3% from a year earlier, a broader look at the figures suggests the slowdown isn't as severe as the latest numbers indicate. In the first quarter, new-home sales fell just 1.8% from the same period of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders say the spring season is starting slowly, but hasn't been disastrous. <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes Corp</span>. said its sales contracts signed in the first quarter fell 1% from a year earlier, to 1,525 homes. Chief Executive Steven Hilton said the national builder's sales improved sequentially from January to March, and its April results are "looking good in comparison to last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Hilton said prices have gotten too high. He said the broader market's recovery depends on mortgage standards easing for first-time buyers. Meritage sold homes at an average price of $364,000 last quarter, up 8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'd like to try to bring our [average selling prices] down across the country," Mr. Hilton told investors Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several economists said the weak March home sales likely go beyond weather. "It is disappointing that new-home sales have shown little improvement since mid-2013, when mortgage rates moved above 4%," said Omair Sharif, at RBS Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell slightly in March and were down 7.5% from a year earlier, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales had been trending up for much of 2011 and 2012, but have been more volatile over the past year. Potential buyers have faced rising mortgage rates, soaring prices and tough lending standards. Builders have complained about rising construction costs, labor shortages and fewer residential lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Hu, a telecommunications engineer who moved to the Dallas area six months ago from Naperville, Ill., said he was surprised by new-home prices in the growing Dallas suburb of Frisco. He has combed the market for two months, and said he might sign a contract for a new, four-bedroom home within days because some builders have said they would raise prices May 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prices, especially in Frisco, have gone up a lot," he said. "The builders don't want to negotiate on prices either."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston-based <span class="companylink">David Weekley Homes</span>, a builder operating in 10 states, sold 20% more homes in the first quarter than a year earlier. Its average selling price was $420,000, a 4% increase on last year's first quarter. President and CEO John Johnson expects a strong spring and summer, but said part of the market isn't buying due to economic uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our industry is doing well, but it could be doing a lot better," Mr. Johnson said. "The people who are buying now are those who have a reason to buy. But there are other people waiting because they're still not secure about their job."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some recent data suggest sales could tick up in coming months. Builders started construction on more homes for the second straight month in March, Commerce reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Shoppers have less to choose from," said <span class="companylink">Pierpont Securities</span> chief economist Stephen Stanley. "But, as far as I can tell, builders are still intent on getting more new homes on the market ASAP."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is getting harder to maintain a belief that recent softness in the housing market is mostly due to the tough winter. But the chill on home sales may not be as bad as it seems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday brought more bad news: The Commerce Department reported seasonally adjusted new-home sales hit an annual rate of 384,000 in March, down from 443,000 a year earlier and well below economists' median estimate of 450,000. Worse, the weakness was broadly based, with sales in the South and West -- where weather provides less of an excuse -- falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span> reported first-quarter results that missed estimates. That matters because unlike <span class="companylink">NVR</span>, which badly missed on Monday, Meritage mainly builds homes in areas such as Texas and Arizona. Along with a disappointing report Tuesday on sales of previously owned homes in March from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, and reports of weak buyer traffic, it looks like the spring selling season is starting slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several related factors weigh on housing. For one, homes have gotten pricier: <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s latest reading showed prices in February up 12%, year over year. Qualifying for a loan remains difficult for many would-be buyers. The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>'s index of mortgage applications for home purchases is stuck in the rut it has been in since 2010. And weak income growth makes it hard for many people to afford a first home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For builders, the weakness is particularly troubling. As Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson points out, they are typically more motivated sellers than private homeowners. So they can't easily raise prices, and may even have to trim them, despite rising costs for land, materials and construction labor -- not the stuff of profit-margin expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are some quirks that suggest housing's weakness may be overstated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, housing data are volatile -- especially in the first quarter when, whatever the weather, not many homes get sold. Second, high prices are mostly a problem in the South and West, home to the 16 large housing markets real-estate firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> rates as overvalued. The more reasonably valued Midwest and Northeast, which were more weather afflicted, could be due for a sharp rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-selling season may not be as verdant as investors hoped it would be a few months ago. But it could be greener than many think it will be.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Ireland Seeks U.S. Court Approval to Sell EUR15 Billion in Soured Loans; Debt Stems from Government Takeover of Irish Banks During Property Market Collapse</span>
</div><div class="author">Peg Brickley  </div><div>682 words</div><div>23 April 2014</div><div>13:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in charge of liquidating a pair of failed Irish banks are asking a U.S. bankruptcy judge to sign off on sales involving about EUR15 billion ($20.72 billion) in soured loans, as Ireland continues to dig out from the wreckage of its collapsed property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Irish Bank Resolution Corp</span>., a state-backed bank liquidation vehicle, is selling the bad loans at a discount to a group of distressed debt buyers, including affiliates of <span class="companylink">Lone Star Funds</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank Group</span>, and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approval from Judge Christopher Sontchi of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., will allow the sales to go through free of liens, claims and encumbrances, as part of a Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals, announced earlier this month, relieve Irish taxpayers of the worry of cleaning up after Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and <span class="companylink">Irish Nationwide Building Society</span>, which were swept under when prices for homes and commercial real estate collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society ran into trouble when Irish property values collapsed during the shaking of the global financial system in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irish government stepped in, and the two distressed institutions were put together to create Irish Bank Resolution Corp. in July 2011. The toxic debt burden continued to weigh on Ireland, prompting a decision to get rid of the portfolios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Anglo Irish collapse, in particular, still echoes in Ireland. Earlier this month, two former Anglo Irish executives were found guilty of illegally lending money to prop up the bank's shares in 2008. The bank's former chairman was acquitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan-portfolio sales headed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. for approval are the last major burden the Irish government shouldered when it took over the failed banks and began managing their assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, IBRC's liquidators have sold almost EUR20 billion of commercial and real estate mortgage loans. KPMG's Andrew Jenke said the sales capitalized on a "strong level of demand from buyers and funders for noncore bank assets, across Ireland, the U.K. and Europe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials are asking for approval from a U.S. bankruptcy judge because of ties that some of the loans have to the U.S., such as the properties are located in the country, or a borrower who is a U.S. resident or has become one since the loan was made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S. is designed to allow international corporations to safeguard their U.S. assets from creditors while working out their financial difficulties in proceedings governed by the laws of their home countries. Special liquidators at KPMG initiated a Chapter 15 bankruptcy for IBRC last year, after Ireland began to exit the bad bank business that was weighing on its national finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IBRC's liquidation is governed by rules established by Irish finance officials, rules which required liquidators to hit valuation targets set by an independent adviser, according to papers filed in the Chapter 15 bankruptcy case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Irish liquidation rules also require that the ultimate price on the sales, and the valuation targets, be kept confidential to get the most for the loans being sold, according to Van Durrer, lawyer for the liquidators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ireland required confidential treatment of the valuation targets "because disclosure of that valuation would discourage any bidding in excess of that valuation and therefore artificially impair the special liquidators' ability to maximize value," Mr. Durrer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at undisclosed prices are unheard of in U.S. Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcies, but IBRC's liquidators will <span class="companylink">seek</span> Judge Sontchi's approval based on the validity of the process—which involved multiple rounds of bidding and intense marketing—and the push under Chapter 15 law for U.S. courts to accord deference to the rules of the main insolvency proceeding in another country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your editorial "Sons of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>" (April 14) is a continued depiction by many policy makers and pundits that higher loan limits have allowed Californians to live in 10,000-sqare-foot mansions at taxpayers' expense. While a $780,000 house may be a mansion in Texas, Alabama or other states, in California that buys a 2,400-square-foot house in Orange County or a 1,600-square-foot house in the San Francisco Bay Area -- hardly mansions.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your editorial "Sons of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>" (April 14) is a continued depiction by many policy makers and pundits that higher loan limits have allowed Californians to live in 10,000-sqare-foot mansions at taxpayers' expense. While a $780,000 house may be a mansion in Texas, Alabama or other states, in California that buys a 2,400-square-foot house in Orange County or a 1,600-square-foot house in the San Francisco Bay Area—hardly mansions.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Sales of previously owned homes fell slightly in March, a sign the U.S. housing market has continued to struggle into the spring but may be stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 0.2% from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected sales to fall a steeper 0.7% to an annual rate of 4.57 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were down 7.5% in March from a year earlier and were at their slowest pace since July 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market saw strong growth in 2012 and 2013. But existing-home sales hit a seasonally adjusted peak last July and have fallen in seven of the past eight months. High prices, stringent lending standards, a rise in borrowing costs and a harsh winter have been blamed for the slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the housing market's weakness reflects non-weather factors like surging prices in the western U.S. that are discouraging first-time buyers, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia Inc</span>. "The weather has a modest effect on housing activity, but the swings that we saw this winter were bigger than could be explained by the weather," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not all bad news, he said. Distressed sales, such as foreclosures and short sales, are down from a year ago. "The decline in existing-home sales overall is partly a shift away from foreclosures, and that's a necessary part of the housing recovery," Mr. Kolko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring buying season is critical for the U.S. housing market because families typically want to lock into a school district by the end of summer, and existing homes account for more than 90% of total sales. Sales last month rose in the Northeast and Midwest, but fell in the South and West. Single-family home sales were flat and condo sales fell 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes were down 3.3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000. The Commerce Department will release March data on new-home sales on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March was the second straight month that saw a fairly shallow decline in existing-home sales, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Sales may be stabilizing," Mr. Yun said. "I do expect some spring bounce in the coming months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said, rising prices are continuing to make homes less affordable. The median sale price of a previously owned home in March was $198,500, up 7.9% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates also are up since the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> last May signaled it would begin pulling back its easy-money policies. The central bank started reducing its monthly bond purchases in December and plans to end the program this year, though it is expected to keep short-term interest rates anchored near zero into 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage had an average interest rate of 4.27% last week. The average rate so far this year has been 4.36%, up from 3.45% in April 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a 5.2-month supply of unsold previously owned homes on the market in March at the current pace of sales, up from 5 months in February. Mr. Yun said a faster pace of new-home construction is needed to help bring down rising prices, but he said many home builders are facing financing difficulties and labor shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are feeling pain. Housing starts were up a seasonally adjusted 2.8% in March but residential housing permits, an indicator of future construction plans, were down 2.4%, according to the Commerce Department. An index of home-builder confidence ticked up in April but remained below 50, the dividing line between generally positive and generally negative conditions, for a third straight month, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many companies whose fortunes are tied to the real-estate market are optimistic heading into the spring. Paint maker <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams Co</span>. expects the housing market will rebound in the coming months, despite higher borrowing costs. "We do not believe that interest rates are significantly affecting affordability, so we would expect some pickup in the rate of sales in the spring," spokesman Bob Wells told analysts last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market "still has far to go," Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said last week in New York, but "it seems to have turned a corner."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Slow Start to the House-Selling Season; Many Had Hoped Warmer Weather Would Rekindle Growth</span>
</div><div>549 words</div><div>19 April 2014</div><div>20:01</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of recent housing data suggests that the market's spring selling season is getting off to a slow start, a worrisome sign after a winter of expectations that warmer weather would rekindle growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from local real-estate agent groups in some of the markets that were the first to rebound, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Diego, show year-over-year declines in March home sales. February data for pending home sales nationally—a barometer of early-spring activity—show a decline of 11% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction of single-family homes is also increasing slowly, according to data released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building permits for single-family homes in March fell 1.2% below the year-earlier level, the Commerce Department said. New single-family home starts rose 1.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in the number of Americans receiving Social Security disability benefits—up 42% since 2004—appears to have hit a plateau, but it's unclear if the program has actually peaked and will ever recede.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans receiving benefits hit 10,939,936 in March 2013 and has hovered around that level for the past year, according to <span class="companylink">Social Security Administration</span> data. The program topped out at 10,988,269 in December and then retreated a bit. As of March, total enrollees hit 10,981,423. Average monthly benefits have ticked up slightly, to $995.38.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program has become so large that budget watchers have estimated it could exhaust all of its trust fund reserves sometime in 2016 or 2017. But as people have watched it grow, some experts have wondered if it would ever stop growing. Now they know—it leveled off, at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Social Security Disability Insurance program is one of the government's largest entitlement plans, paying out close to $140 billion in benefits each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for benefits surged during the economic downturn, but have eased considerably as the economy has slowly recovered. In 2010, 2.9 million Americans applied for disabled worker benefits, twice the number that applied in 2000. In 2013, 2.6 million people applied for benefits, the lowest number since 2008, and the agency awarded benefits to 884,894 workers, the lowest number since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger-than-expected gains in production have the U.S. industrial sector operating at its highest rate since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Wednesday that industrial output increased a larger-than-expected 0.7% in March, on top of a 1.2% jump in February. In turn, capacity utilization increased to 79.2% in March, the best reading since June 2008. Manufacturing alone is using 76.7% of available capacity, well above the 63.9% low hit during the last recession. The rate is edging closer to its long-run average of 80.1%, suggesting industrial businesses will accelerate expansion plans soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some of the rising utilization rate reflects the fact that companies closed down some production facilities during the recession and early years of this recovery. But over the past year, capacity has edged up 2.2% while output has risen 3.8%, leading to the higher operating percentage.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A flurry of recent housing data suggests that the market's spring selling season is getting off to a slow start, a worrisome sign after a winter of expectations that warmer weather would rekindle growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from local real-estate agent groups in some of the markets that were the first to rebound, including Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Diego, show year-over-year declines in March home sales. February data for pending home sales nationally—a barometer of early-spring activity—show a decline of 11% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in markets around the country, fewer people are showing up at open houses. An index of home-buyer traffic in 40 U.S. markets compiled by <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> was down a little more than a third from March of last year. In some parts of the country, cold weather has put a damper on traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction of single family homes is also increasing slowly, according to new data released Wednesday. New building permits for single-family homes in March fell 1.2% below the year-earlier level, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. New single-family home starts rose 1.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, even after adjusting for weather, it has been worse than what most people expected," said Tom Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sluggish start to the spring home-buying season—a crucial period for sales because families typically want to lock into a school district by the end of summer—comes as investors cut back on purchases of homes that can be rented or flipped for a quick profit. Meanwhile, potential buyers are still adjusting to a sharp rise in both home prices and borrowing costs over the past year. With prices and mortgage rates up, the nation's median monthly home payment—including principal and interest—has risen 20% in the past year to about $900, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slow spring so far is in some ways a testament to just how swift the past two years of recovery have been. There are fewer distressed properties like foreclosures, and prices of those that remain are higher, so investors are buying fewer homes. At the same time, there has been a continued increase in the number of nondistressed purchases made by ordinary buyers and families, further reducing the inventory of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has allayed economists' fears that the "shadow inventory" of unsold homes would choke off the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are now two trends at play that potentially could extend a springtime swoon into a summer slump: a dearth of properties for sale in some markets and an abundance of too-richly-priced homes in other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released Tuesday by DataQuick, a San Diego research company, showed that Southern California home sales had their second-slowest March in two decades, as rising prices and a thin supply of homes damped sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices hit a six-year high—not just because buyers are bidding up the homes that are left, but also because there has been a shift away from the first-time home-buyer market to middle and higher-end sales, said Andrew LePage, an analyst at DataQuick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, the supply of homes for sale is adequate, if not ample, but prices are keeping buyers at bay. There, sales of previously owned homes fell nearly 18% in March from a year earlier, while inventories rose 44% to a three-year high, according to the <span class="companylink">Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more inventory, potential buyers such as Sarah Coffeen can afford to be deliberate with their search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Coffeen, 31 years old, has been looking for a home in the Phoenix area since January. Her hope is to find a single-family home in the $120,000 range, and until then she and her daughter are living with her parents to help save for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her wait may pay off. While the Phoenix market is still fairly competitive, the inventory of homes for sale has started to tick up, and price gains are slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm pretty much willing to take my time because so much stuff is coming on the market," said Ms. Coffeen, a paralegal. "Prices are definitely down from the fall. I don't know if that mini bubble burst…but homes seem more reasonable now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Phoenix has been one of the nation's hottest housing markets over the past two years, leading the nation in what has to this point been a strong recovery. Now—along with Las Vegas and the Inland Empire region of California that is east of Los Angeles—it is among those cities where many sellers are reducing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Zillow, some 28% of U.S. home listings have had at least one price cut in February, compared with about 26% last February. But in markets like Phoenix and Las Vegas, the degree of price cuts has been much more dramatic. In Phoenix, for instance, about 45% of February listings had at least one price cut, compared with 32% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, real estate is all local, and much of the recent slowdown has been concentrated in markets through the West and Southwest that had been leading the recovery. A recent bright spot has been markets in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast——like New York, Fairfield County, Conn., and Baltimore—which had been lagging behind hotter regions last year but are now looking much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Markets in the West were skewed by the ramp up in distressed sales last year and now they're cooling, whereas the Northeast didn't have that so now we're looking better," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Capen, a real-estate agent in St. Petersburg, Fla., decided last week to hire another agent for his company after seeing stronger buyer demand. Last summer, when mortgage rates went up, "everyone panicked," he said, and Mr. Capen shelved plans to bring on a new hire. "But rates have been sitting there for a while now, and it looks like everyone's adjusted to it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Capen listed recently a three-bedroom home in Palm Harbor, Fla., for $275,000 that went under contract within three days. "The homes that are in tip-top condition—they still move fast," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many observers expect the market to work past the sluggish start to spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While home builder sentiment has started the year on a soft note, we expect that rising home prices, low inventory levels, and stronger demand will boost construction activity as the spring selling season progresses," <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing analyst Ivy Zelman cut her forecast for sales of existing homes this year but says she's still optimistic about the U.S. housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report Friday, her firm Zelman &amp; Associates said it expects a 5% drop in sales of previously owned homes for 2014 to a seasonally adjusted annual level of 4.8 million units. At the start of the year, the firm had forecast nearly a 6% gain from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman isn't changing her forecasts for new-home sales, which are forecast to hit 505,000 this year, up 17% from last year. Her estimates of new-home construction were mostly unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're bullish still," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zelman said she trimmed her home-sales forecast in part because of sustained declines in foreclosures and other distressed properties coming to market. She estimates the supply of those homes is down 20% from a year ago. Reduced competition could benefit home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, real-estate agents see a buyers' market that helps explain the slow spring so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Torrey McHale, Ms. Coffeen's real-estate agent in Phoenix, said that when he looks at listings data, he sees more homes for sale and less buyer activity. And when he hits the street with clients, it is harder to get them to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been more difficult getting buyers under contract because if they don't like one house they'll just go onto the next," he said. "Last summer was a huge sellers' market. I'd walk into homes with buyers and there would already be three offers on the home. Listing agents and sellers got greedy and start raising prices really fast. I think they did overshoot and now it's kind of turned."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initial public offering market suffered another setback Tuesday, when investment bank <span class="companylink">Moelis &amp; Co</span>. priced its IPO below expectations and housing materials maker Associated Materials Group Inc. pulled its planned offering amid soft investor demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moelis, based in New York, sold 6.5 million shares for $25 apiece, said a person familiar with the matter, raising $162.5 million before the potential sale of additional shares by underwriters. Moelis had expected to offer 7.3 million shares for $26 to $29 each, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, Associated Materials shelved its plans for an initial public offering, following a selloff in shares of some peers this year. Building-products firms <span class="companylink">Ply Gem Holdings Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Boise Cascade Co</span>. went public in 2013 and have seen their shares fall more than 10%so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A determination has been made not to proceed with the initial public offering," Associated Materials said in a filing Tuesday. The Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio-based company didn't say why it was pulling the deal. A spokeswoman for the company couldn't immediately be reached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two initial public offerings priced well below expectations Monday, adding to evidence the new-listings corner of the stock market is losing some swagger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Payroll-software company <span class="companylink">Paycom Software Inc</span>.'s $100 million IPO priced at $15 a share, 21% below the midpoint of the company's forecast price range. Commercial property owner <span class="companylink">City Office REIT Inc</span>.'s shares fetched $12.50, 17% below the middle of the price range it had predicted. City Office REIT also sold 13% fewer shares than planned. On Tuesday, Paycom rose 2.7% and City Office dropped 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are also monitoring expected offerings this week from Travelocity operator <span class="companylink">Sabre Corp</span>. and Chinese <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>-like service <span class="companylink">Weibo Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the bulk of IPOs in 2013 and this year have priced in line with or above issuers' expectations. As stock indexes have fallen into the red and shares of many newly public firms have pulled back, some market participants are wondering if companies will have a tougher time going public than in 2013, when widespread demand for U.S. stocks fueled the most active year for IPO issuance since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are keeping a close eye on Wednesday's planned listing of specialty-finance company <span class="companylink">FS Investment Corp</span>. amid the turbulence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FS Investment is a venture of Franklin Square Capital Partners and <span class="companylink">GSO Capital Partners LP</span>, the credit arm of private-equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group LP</span>. FS Investment isn't selling any new shares, but existing holders of $2.7 billion worth of private shares—largely retail investors who made purchases in previous private offerings—are free sell into the public market once the listing takes effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FSIC listing is unlike a traditional IPO, in which a private company or its financial backers essentially auction shares to investors to determine their initial value. Rather, the deal gives existing shareholders the option to sell; new investors can buy only the shares they unload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, which primarily lends to privately held U.S. companies, is expected to be listed on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span> under the ticker symbol "FSIC."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts and industry participants see the listing as a sign of the maturation in the market for so-called business-development companies. Many participants are trying to attract larger investors to an industry that has long been the preserve of individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A listing from a private equity-backed firm "begins to create some comfort with institutional investors owning these names, and it helps the smaller players," said Robert Dodd, senior vice president in research for specialty finance companies at Raymond James.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A typical BDC targets about 90% retail investors and 10% institutional buyers, said Mr. Dodd. An IPO in March for <span class="companylink">TPG Specialty Lending Inc</span>., an affiliate of private-equity firm <span class="companylink">TPG Capital</span>, had about 85% institutional participation, according to people familiar with the deal, something analysts said was a departure from the norm.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. home builders remained downbeat in April, a sign the housing market is still shaky despite the arrival of spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of builder confidence in the market for new single-family homes rose 1 point to a seasonally adjusted 47 in April, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Tuesday. A reading below 50 means more builders generally see conditions as bad than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any winter weather-related issues should have faded by now, said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. In a note to clients, he described Tuesday's report as "weaker than expected again—and fairly disappointing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index tumbled 10 points in February, to 46. It remained at 46 in March, revised down from an initially reported 47. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected it would rise in April to 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, observers expect the market to work past the soft spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builder confidence has been in a holding pattern the past three months," said the trade group's chairman, Kevin Kelly. Sales prospects should improve in the coming months "as the spring home buying season gets into full swing and demand increases," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> economist Michael Gapen also is optimistic. "While home builder sentiment has started the year on a soft note, we expect that rising home prices, low inventory levels, and stronger demand will boost construction activity as the spring selling season progresses," he wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index was below 50 in all four regions of the country in April. It fell to 45 from 51 in the West and ticked down to 48 from 50 in the Midwest from March. It held steady at 48 in the South and rose to 36 from 30 in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortages of labor and building lots in a number of markets are holding back the housing market's recovery, along with tight credit conditions, said David Crowe, the NAHB's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market expanded robustly in 2013, but appeared to lose steam in the second half of the year as borrowing costs rose. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage had an average interest rate of 4.34% last week, up from an average rate of 3.45% last April, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices have discouraged some potential buyers, as did unusually harsh weather across much of the U.S. this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell in February to their lowest level since July 2012, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said. New-home sales declined in February, the Commerce Department said, and housing starts slipped, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was a bright spot. Building permits were up a seasonally adjusted 7.7% in February from the prior month, the Commerce Department said, a sign residential construction could rebound in the coming months.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Douglas Feiden  </div><div>525 words</div><div>14 April 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A24</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the southeast corner of Park Avenue South and East 22nd Street was in private hands was 1892 -- and the landowner was J. Pierpont Morgan, the peerless financier and philanthropist who bought the site and donated it to support the growing missionary work of his church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Church Missions House at 281 Park Ave. South is on track to revert to for-profit ownership: The six-story, 36,749-square-foot jewel, built in the Flemish-Renaissance style between 1892 and 1894, is being put up for sale on Monday and will be marketed jointly by Massey Knakal Realty Services and <span class="companylink">Studley Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price: $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its owner, for the last 51 years, has been the nonprofit <span class="companylink">Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies</span>. Before that, the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church held title to the landmark for 71 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building's history tells the story of New York's rising real estate prices. The construction cost $500,000, which included a $50,000 gift from New York Central Railroad chief Cornelius Vanderbilt II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1963, the federation paid $910,000 for the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's our greatest asset in terms of monetary value, and it will advance the needs of the most vulnerable New Yorkers," said Jennifer Jones Austin, the executive director of the federation, which provides advocacy services and management assistance to 200 churches and social-service agencies, many of them faith-based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federation was the last major holdout in the heart of the city's venerable but vanishing Charity Row. The area where scores of nonprofits once ministered to the poor has morphed into a hip place for the affluent to live and work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Church Missions House is directly south of the United Charities Building, at 105 East 22nd St., which came on the market just three weeks ago, and is around the corner from the headquarters of United Cerebral Palsy of New York, at 122 East 23rd St.; United Cerebral Palsy of New York agreed last year to sell its building to national home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be the ideal location for a tech or media company's flagship headquarters," said John Ciraulo, vice chairman of Massey Knakal, who says a developer could also capitalize on Midtown South's booming residential condo market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the federation, its new home could be outside of Midtown, said Howard Poretsky, senior managing director at Studley, which is handling the relocation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We will explore options downtown, in Harlem and in Brooklyn," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale will boost the federation's $20 million endowment as well as make it easier to fund its $5.6 million budget and support its member agencies, which provide day care, geriatric care, AIDS services, mental health services and other caregiving to the fragile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federation "is more than a building," Ms. Jones Austin said. "It's not about where we sit; it's about the work we do."</p>

</div><div class="author">Andrew Blackman </div><div>1009 words</div><div>13 April 2014</div><div>12:50</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before last year, Ed Medley had never invested in commercial real estate. Now, he's a part-owner of shopping malls, mobile-home parks and apartment buildings from Los Angeles to Tennessee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Medley's springboard into real-estate investing was supplied by a process known as crowdfunding—the sale of shares in a venture, in this case real-estate projects, to hundreds or even thousands of individual investors. Dr. Medley, a consulting engineer and geologist in San Mateo, Calif., has invested in 15 properties, with a minimum of $5,000 in each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being able to invest relatively small amounts of money into different real-estate ventures was appealing" as a way of limiting risk, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, other real-estate investors feel the same way, with new websites springing up that allow individuals to buy stakes in everything from self-storage facilities to luxury hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The interest is huge," says Scott Whaley, president of the National Real Estate Investors Association in Cincinnati. "There's massive demand, both from entrepreneurs who want to get access to capital, and from people who want to invest capital."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Focused Investments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowdfunding has caught on in a variety of industries, spurred in part by regulatory changes that make it easier for such businesses to look for investors. In real estate, Mr. Whaley says, the key advantages are the ability to access more deals, invest smaller sums and connect directly with developers to ask questions and research deals. Unlike real-estate investment trusts, crowdfunding also allows people to invest in particular buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Medley found his opportunities on RealtyMogul.com, operated by Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Realty Mogul Co. When a property starts to earn rental income, he gets a share of that. Most pay 8% or 9% annually, and he has received a couple of thousand dollars so far. He'll also receive a share of any profits when the buildings are sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Medley and his wife are in their mid-60s and semiretired, so the income stream is "attractive," he says. He knows there's risk involved, but says he isn't too concerned. "The total position that we have in crowdfunding is a relatively small part of our portfolio."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most crowdfunding deals work in a similar way, with investors funding a project and receiving a share of the income when it's up and running, plus a share of the proceeds when the property is sold. Jilliene Helman, co-founder and CEO of Realty Mogul, says that while returns vary and aren't guaranteed, the company aims to provide investors with a 14% to 15% annual return, including quarterly payments and price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, most crowdfunding deals are limited to accredited investors, those with an annual income exceeding $200,000 or a net worth (excluding a primary residence) above $1 million. But the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> is working on proposed rules to open crowdfunding to non-accredited investors as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Types of deals offered vary by site. Fundrise LLC of Washington, D.C., accepts investments as low as $100. "We're focused on letting everyone invest in private real estate, not just high net worth individuals and institutional investors," says Fundrise Co-Founder Ben Miller. The average investment is less than $10,000, compared with $60,000 at Realty Mogul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Micah Lubens, 26 years old, has used Fundrise to put a total of $700 into two Washington, D.C., buildings under redevelopment. "I've lived in D.C. for the last seven years and I love it, so this was a way for me to own and be invested in the city," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For higher-end projects, some investors turn to New York-based Prodigy Network. The company has raised more than $200 million from 4,200 investors in Colombia to build that country's tallest skyscraper, and $30 million for a luxury extended-stay residence in New York's lower Manhattan. It's now seeking to raise $55 million from individual investors for another luxury New York hotel project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do Your Homework</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts caution that crowdfunding in real estate is a very new area, and that investors should do plenty of research before committing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By nature, [real-estate] crowdfunding is a high-risk asset class," says Sherwood Neiss, co-founder of consulting firm Crowdfund Capital Advisors. He recommends starting with only a small portion of your overall portfolio, and focusing on the track record of the people running the projects. "Have they had prior successes? Who knows them? Look at all the disclosures. You can't go into this thinking that just because the opportunity's there, it's a good investment," Mr. Neiss says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prodigy Chief Executive Rodrigo Niño says investors should make sure any money they invest is handled by a third-party fund administrator and held in escrow until the project is fully funded. Ask for full disclosure about "related parties" in the transaction, too. "If I bring in my cousin to do the construction and my wife to be the hotel operator, that is shady," Mr. Niño says. And be sure investors have equal rights. "You want to know that the sponsor is not making money if you're not making money as well," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Spirer, CEO of technology firm DilogR LLC in Austin, Texas, and author of a book on crowdfunding, advises investors who are just starting out to become an expert in one type of property. "Look at a lot of deals," he says. "Learn about the criteria for determining value, then weigh that against what's being shown to you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally, investors should ask about the exit strategy, since some properties can take a long time to sell. Even if a promised yield is achieved, says Mr. Spirer, "there's still a risk that you won't get the cash out at the end."</p>

</div><div class="author">Nick Timiraos </div><div>324 words</div><div>10 April 2014</div><div>12:46</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CarVal Investors, a distressed-asset firm that is a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Cargill Inc</span>., accumulated an 11.6% stake in a single class of preferred shares issued by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, according to a federal filing by Freddie on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge funds and other distressed-equity investors have scooped up the preferred shares of Freddie and its larger rival, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, over the past year on the bet that the companies will be profitable enough that even if the government follows through on its plans to liquidate the firms, enough money will be left over for preferred shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie have around 40 different classes of preferred shares outstanding that have a redemption value of a combined $33 billion, though they have traded at huge discounts to those values since the firms were seized by the U.S. and placed into conservatorship in 2008. Preferred shares are senior to the companies' common shares. They used to pay a dividend, but those payments ceased after the firms went into conservatorship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have bet on the preferred shares because those stand to be paid out ahead of the common shares if there are any profits left over after the companies are liquidated or restructured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the government sweeps away all of the quarterly profits of Fannie and Freddie as dividend payments for their 2008 bailouts, but investors have sued the Treasury in federal courts to challenge those changes. The U.S. also owns $187.5 billion in senior preferred shares that would have to be paid off in any overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CarVal's stake is in the 5.1% series of Freddie preferred. It holds some 928,000 shares of that class. There are nearly 464 million shares of all Freddie preferred classes outstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Folkman, a spokeswoman for CarVal, declined to comment.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lisa Selin Davis   </div><div>871 words</div><div>4 April 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices and an increase in jumbo mortgage rates are leading some wealthy home shoppers into the arms of luxury landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Halpern, an agent at the New York-based real-estate brokerage Urban Compass, says about 50% of his clients are opting for rentals, many of them after losing bidding wars. They have decided to wait for the market to calm down. "It's not that they can't afford the loan," says Mr. Halpern. "They're not ready to take that risk for something as high priced as the market is bearing right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halpern recently represented a couple, both real-estate attorneys, who sold their co-op on New York's Upper West Side and rented a three-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath condo in the same neighborhood for $13,400 a month. "For them, it's the time to sell, not the time to buy," he says. "A lot of wealthy people are still scared of taking on big loans and would prefer to wait out the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, luxury sales remain healthy overall. The number of homes sold for more than $1 million has been climbing, according to the real-estate website Zillow. These high-end sales increased almost 29% in 2013 compared with the prior year; the median price for those sales was $1.44 million, which was largely unchanged from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some factors are starting to weigh on buyers, including mortgage rates. The average rate for the 30-year fixed-rate jumbo was 4.46% in March, compared with 4.02% in March 2013 and 3.9% in April of last year, according to mortgage information firm HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could prompt wealthy people to invest their money elsewhere, such as in the stock market or in small business, and not tie it up in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who are looking at a $1 million-plus home are more likely to be making money in other ways besides real estate," says Gloria Shulman, founder of <span class="companylink">CenTek Capital Group</span> in Beverly Hills, Calif., a mortgage bank and brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shulman said some of her clients have been turning to the rental market while they prepare to buy a property and wait for a more favorable market for buyers. The complex mortgage-application process is another factor, particularly for the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the current market conditions are a "discouraging trifecta for Manhattan buyers," says Alan Lightfeldt, a data scientist with real-estate website StreetEasy. Buyers face low inventory, higher interest rates and rising prices, making for a challenging spring in the housing market. Sellers, on the other hand, should expect that double-digit price increases will plateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for an advantage are turning to all-cash deals, both to be competitive in a seller's market and to avoid additional interest and mortgage fees, says Mr. Halpern. In the housing market overall, cash purchases without mortgage financing reached a 10-month high in February, according to theCampbell/Inside Mortgage Finance HousingPulse Tracking Survey. Over 30% of home sales that month were all-cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are reasons for buying a luxury home sooner rather than later. For one thing, rents are high. In 2013, there were 1,294 rentals on the market for over $15,000 a month in New York City, almost the same number as the year before, according to StreetEasy. But the median list price of rentals on the market for over $15,000 rose to $21,500 from $20,500, a 4.9% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, chief economist at the real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, says the slow rise of mortgage rates will likely continue, meaning it may be better to buy now in some areas. By <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s calculations, interest rates would need to reach 10.6% for renting to become cheaper than buying in most of the country. But Mr. Kolko says "there are some markets where renting might be cheaper than buying if rates get into the fives." These markets include Honolulu, San Jose, Calif., and San Francisco, where luxury listings are commonplace and home prices have been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing costs, income tax brackets and length of occupancy all also affect the equation. The rent-versus-buy calculation, says Mr. Halpern, isn't just a matter of finances. "It's about where you are in life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some issues to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- How long will you stay: Whether renting is cheaper or more expensive than buying a home, says Mr. Kolko, "depends a lot on things like condo fees, or how long you plan to stay put." Hefty closing costs, for example, can be worth it if you plan to own the home for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Figure out your deductions: Your tax bracket, and how much you benefit from mortgage interest and property-tax deductions, affects the rent-versus-buy calculation. Those in higher tax brackets tend to benefit more from mortgage interest and property-tax deductions, says Mr. Kolko.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices and an increase in jumbo mortgage rates are leading some wealthy home shoppers into the arms of luxury landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Halpern, an agent at the New York-based real-estate brokerage Urban Compass, says about 50% of his clients are opting for rentals, many of them after losing bidding wars. They have decided to wait for the market to calm down. "It's not that they can't afford the loan," says Mr. Halpern. "They're not ready to take that risk for something as high priced as the market is bearing right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Halpern recently represented a couple, both real-estate attorneys, who sold their co-op on New York's Upper West Side and rented a three-bedroom, 3½-bath condo in the same neighborhood for $13,400 a month. "For them, it's the time to sell, not the time to buy," he says. "A lot of wealthy people are still scared of taking on big loans and would prefer to wait out the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, luxury sales remain healthy overall. The number of homes sold for more than $1 million has been climbing, according to the real-estate website Zillow. These high-end sales increased almost 29% in 2013 compared with the prior year; the median price for those sales was $1.44 million, which was largely unchanged from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some factors are starting to weigh on buyers, including mortgage rates. The average rate for the 30-year fixed-rate jumbo was 4.46% in March, compared with 4.02% in March 2013 and 3.9% in April of last year, according to mortgage information firm HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could prompt wealthy people to invest their money elsewhere, such as in the stock market or in small business, and not tie it up in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who are looking at a $1 million-plus home are more likely to be making money in other ways besides real estate," says Gloria Shulman, founder of <span class="companylink">CenTek Capital Group</span> in Beverly Hills, Calif., a mortgage bank and brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shulman said some of her clients have been turning to the rental market while they prepare to buy a property and wait for a more favorable market for buyers. The complex mortgage-application process is another factor, particularly for the self-employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the current market conditions are a "discouraging trifecta for Manhattan buyers," says Alan Lightfeldt, a data scientist with real-estate website StreetEasy. Buyers face low inventory, higher interest rates and rising prices, making for a challenging spring in the housing market. Sellers, on the other hand, should expect that double-digit price increases will plateau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for an advantage are turning to all-cash deals, both to be competitive in a seller's market and to avoid additional interest and mortgage fees, says Mr. Halpern. In the housing market overall, cash purchases without mortgage financing reached a 10-month high in February, according to theCampbell/Inside Mortgage Finance HousingPulse Tracking Survey. Over 30% of home sales that month were all-cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are reasons for buying a luxury home sooner rather than later. For one thing, rents are high. In 2013, there were 1,294 rentals on the market for over $15,000 a month in New York City, almost the same number as the year before, according to StreetEasy. But the median list price of rentals on the market for over $15,000 rose to $21,500 from $20,500, a 4.9% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Kolko, chief economist at the real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, says the slow rise of mortgage rates will likely continue, meaning it may be better to buy now in some areas. By Trulia's calculations, interest rates would need to reach 10.6% for renting to become cheaper than buying in most of the country. But Mr. Kolko says "there are some markets where renting might be cheaper than buying if rates get into the fives." These markets include Honolulu, San Jose, Calif., and San Francisco, where luxury listings are commonplace and home prices have been rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Closing costs, income tax brackets and length of occupancy all also affect the equation. The rent-versus-buy calculation, says Mr. Halpern, isn't just a matter of finances. "It's about where you are in life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some issues to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• How long will you stay: Whether renting is cheaper or more expensive than buying a home, says Mr. Kolko, "depends a lot on things like condo fees, or how long you plan to stay put." Hefty closing costs, for example, can be worth it if you plan to own the home for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Figure out your deductions: Your tax bracket, and how much you benefit from mortgage interest and property-tax deductions, affects the rent-versus-buy calculation. Those in higher tax brackets tend to benefit more from mortgage interest and property-tax deductions, says Mr. Kolko.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder Beazer Homes USA Inc. said it expects a 9% decline in new orders in its fiscal second quarter, dragged down by its West region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the latest period, the company said new orders fell 9% to 1,390 from a year earlier. New orders in its West region slid 16%, Beazer said. It attributed the slump in orders to a 6% decline in active community count.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer also said closings, as well as some new orders, were dragged down by severe weather conditions in its East segment. Closings for the quarter fell 13% to 977.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the company said it still expects to report a profit for fiscal 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We remain optimistic about the 2014 spring selling season," said Chief Executive Allan Merrill. " The new home market continues to benefit from gradual improvements in the labor market, limited home inventories and generally favorable affordability metrics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total backlog units slipped 2% to 2,163 homes for the second quarter. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Kris Hudson   </div><div>728 words</div><div>3 April 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of vacation homes are surging again, the result of rising wealth in higher-income households and renewed confidence in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of second homes acquired for part-time personal use jumped 30% last year to 717,000 homes, according to an annual survey by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The gain was the largest since the association started tracking second-home sales in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the number of second homes sold last year is well short of the high point of nearly 1.1 million in 2006, last year's jump signals a rapidly changing sentiment about the value of residential real estate, which just a few years ago was considered a poor investment amid the broad market bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists note that the vacation-home market was a beneficiary of last year's big gains in the stock market and rising home values, bringing buyers more wealth and confidence. The S&amp;P 500 index of stocks posted a 30% increase last year, its largest since 1997. The median price of an existing home rose by 11.5%, the largest gain since 2005, according to the Realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That combination gives rise to the classic "wealth effect" in which people feel more wealthy and therefore more willing to spend. More households also sought to diversify by transferring gains from stocks and other investments into real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices and favorable currency-exchange rates spurred Calgary residents Sherry and Phillip Hickey to buy a second home in Mesa, Ariz., last year to escape the Canadian winters. The couple, represented by Realtor Kris Anderson at Your Premier Team at RE/Max Excalibur, spent $357,500 on a three-bedroom, three-bathroom home where they intend to spend roughly five months a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just saw that things were looking better in the Phoenix market and prices were going up," Ms. Hickey said. "We wanted to get in before they went up too high and to make use of the Canadian dollar at par" with the U.S. dollar at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hickey, 56 years old, and her husband, 63, who own a small business in concrete forming, spent several decades of savings on the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is in full-blown recovery mode," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank Securities. "People are much more confident in the sector as a long-term investment [as shown by] their decision to purchase an extraordinarily discretionary item, a second home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, vacation homes accounted for 13% of U.S. home sales last year, up from 11% in 2012, according to the Realtor association survey. Their median price last year was $168,700, up 12.5% from 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the South accounted for most vacation home sales last year -- 41% -- likely due to its mild weather. Next was the West, with 28%; the Northeast, with 18%; and the Midwest, with 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market definitely picked up for vacation homes in the Tampa Bay area overall last year," said Tony Baroni, who leads five real-estate agents at <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in the Tampa Bay, Fla., area. "Our market had gone down so much [in price] that, even when it started recovering, buyers still felt like it was a great value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-home surge also underscores a disparity in the market. More-affluent, move-up buyers trading into their second- or third-generation home have carried the U.S. real-estate market in recent years as would-be first-time buyers have been hobbled by strict mortgage-qualification standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, several measures show that household wealth reached new heights last year. Pay gains have favored better earners; <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> data show that the top 60% of U.S. earners saw household income rise by 2.3% or more in 2012 while the bottom 40% saw gains of less than 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Realtor association's survey, which covered 2,008 households, also found that second-home purchases by investors declined last year by 8.5% to an estimated 1.1 million. Such a drop has been widely forecast as home prices rise and the number of foreclosed and distressed properties declines. The survey doesn't include purchases by large, institutional investors.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 16-room Fifth Avenue home of the late Edgar Bronfman Sr. has gone into contract for $70 million -- after a bidding war -- setting what could be a record for the sale of a Manhattan cooperative, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale price was $5 million more than the $65 million asking price listed last month for the apartment of the former chairman of Seagram Co. and the former president of the World Jewish Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quick deal at a high price is an indicator of the strong demand for a limited supply of apartments in the upper end of the market, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers familiar with the matter said that the listing brokers, Mary Rutherfurd, Alina Pedroso and Leslie Coleman, had negotiated a deal at the full asking price, when a second buyer stepped in and offered $5 million more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokers, who are with Brown Harris Stevens, declined to comment on the transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op was listed by the family of Mr. Bronfman, who died in December at the age of 84.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The identity of the buyer wasn't immediately disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is a full-floor penthouse in a co-op at 960 Fifth Ave., on the corner of East 77th Street. The apartment has terraces on all sides, including one measuring 100 feet across that faces Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides a living room, formal dining room and library, the home has five bedrooms, 8 1/2 bathrooms, and four staff bedrooms, on a separate level, one floor below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers who toured the property said the Bronfmans had lived in the house for four decades, and that it needed considerable renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-op sales are subject to approval by co-op boards, which sometimes reject buyers. If this sale goes through, it would far exceed the most expensive co-op sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The record is the $54 million purchase in 2012 of a penthouse at another Fifth Avenue building, 785 Fifth Ave., by David Geffen, the music mogul. Denise Rich, the socialite, was the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the prices of grand co-ops built before World War II have lagged behind those of new condominiums, many of which offer glass walls or huge windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive apartment sale to date is the $88 million sale of a penthouse at 15 Central Park West, by Sanford Weill, the former chairman of <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>., to the family of a Russian billionaire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several apartments in new condominiums have been reported in contract at even higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with a limited inventory of apartments on the market, co-op prices have been rising, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of 2014, the median price of a Manhattan co-op set a record at $760,000, topping records set in 2008 near the end of the last real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One broker familiar with the property but not involved in the sale, said that the competing buyers sought the kind of old-fashioned elegant apartment in a fashionable building that is rarely on the market these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a once in a lifetime kind of property," the broker said. "The terraces, the views, the way it is situated, properties like that just don't exist."</p>

</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty   </div><div>643 words</div><div>2 April 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment landlords continued to push through hefty rent increases at the start of the year, although the pace of the rises was slightly weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental rates increased 0.6% during the first quarter, according to data from 79 U.S. metro areas that was released Tuesday by <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., a real-estate research firm. While that was a little slower than the 0.8% rise in last year's fourth quarter, rents were up a hefty 3.2% from a year earlier and have risen 13% since rents began their upward trajectory in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with vacancy levels falling, rents appear poised for further growth, according to Reis, which said the rental vacancy rate fell to 4% in the first quarter, down from 4.2% in the fourth quarter and half the level in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rents are at a higher base and still growing," said Ryan Severino, an economist at Reis. "They will likely keep growing for the next few years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental pressure has been building for years, as rising demand has run into an undersupply of apartments. With employment rising slowly but steadily, more young people are forming households, usually by leaving their parents' residences or breaking off from groups of roommates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the cost of buying a home has increased dramatically during the past year as prices have rebounded and interest rates have risen from record lows. The median monthly home payment -- including principle and interest -- has risen 20% in the past year, said John Burns Real Estate Consulting. That has forced some entry-level buyers to continue renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few markets are more challenging than California's Silicon Valley, where the twin forces of rising employment and a chronic housing shortage have sent rents skyward. Rents in the San Jose metropolitan area grew 1.1% in the fourth quarter to an average of about $1,724, the second fastest rise in the nation last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burden of rising rents has fallen hard on young workers, who are more likely to be renting -- or, in many cases, looking to get their own place after years of underemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people have seen their job growth pick up of late, but they still are below where they were before the recession. About three-quarters of 25-to-34-year-olds had jobs in February, down from a prerecession high of 80% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lyle Burlingame, 29 years old, is among those struggling to keep up. Seven months ago, Mr. Burlingame moved to Belmont, Calif., to take a job in the information-technology area for a health-care system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, he rented a one-bedroom apartment for $2,000 a month, spending well over half his monthly income in rent. To lighten the burden, he subleased the place and moved into another apartment with a friend. He pays $1,200 in rent -- about half his take-home pay -- but is living in cramped quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have the bedroom and he has the living room, which bleeds into the kitchen, and it's terrible," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burlingame is now on the hunt for his third residence in less than a year. He hopes to live in nearby San Francisco, where vacancy is 2.9% and the average rent is about $2,100 -- the highest outside of New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burlingame is hoping to find a house with roommates and is willing to pay as much as $1,400 a month. Meanwhile, he is chewing up much of his free time. "It's like having a second job that I need to do after work," he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">Esther Fung </div><div>692 words</div><div>1 April 2014</div><div>07:27</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's housing market showed a further slowdown in March as new data indicated that price growth moderated in more cities, with developers slashing prices to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average new-home prices grew 10.04% in March from a year earlier, decelerating for the third straight month after February's 10.79% rise and January's 11.1% gain, data provider <span class="companylink">China Real Estate</span> Index System said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property sector is a key engine of growth for the Chinese economy, with real-estate investment accounting for 15% of the economy. Policy makers have tried to balance the challenges of reining in frothy housing prices in large cities and sluggish demand and oversupply in smaller urban centers, particularly as they wrestle with slowing economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many potential home buyers are staying on the sidelines as property developers cut prices, sales agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Beijing, some property companies have reportedly asked for lower-than-expected prices on new housing projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-March, <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>, the nation's largest property developer by revenue, sold apartments in a project near the sixth ring road on the outskirts of Beijing at around 2,000 to 3,000 yuan lower than market expectations. Beijing authorities last year introduced a new type of affordable home that would be priced around 30% cheaper than comparable housing nearby, and pledged to supply a total of 70,000 such units by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property price and sales data in March are typically more reliable indicators of the strength of market demand, as January and February are slower sales periods due to the Lunar New Year holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said home prices would continue to cool in the coming months as many developers are eager to drive sales amid an oversupply of homes in some markets, especially in tier two and tier three cities. Home buyers are also facing a tougher credit environment compared with 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of banks are now offering mortgage loans to first time home buyers at benchmark lending rates or at a 10% to 15% premium, and this relatively tight credit market has dented sentiment," said Frank Chen, executive director at CBRE Research, a real estate consulting company. Last year, buyers could get a 10% to 15% discount below the central bank's benchmark lending level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many property developers, emboldened by strong sales in 2013, bought more land to build up their land banks, but are now struggling with tighter credit and growing competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Signs are mounting that the housing market in a number of cities is not just cooling but actually cracking," said Wei Yao, China economist at French <span class="companylink">bank Société Générale</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the CREIS survey, more cities showed a decline in housing prices, with 37 cities registering lower month-on-month prices compared with 36 in February. Prices in the 63 other cities covered in the survey were higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a month-on-month basis, home prices in Shantou city in southern Guangdong province fell the most, losing 3.0%, and in Heze city in Shandong province, prices declined 2.9%. Attitudes toward home purchases as investments have also shifted, especially in smaller cities where the growth in value of homes has been slowing and evidence of overbuilding becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in many cities are starting to moderate amid slower economic growth and the introduction of other high-yielding investment alternatives such as online funds. Other wealthier Chinese people have also been active in buying homes abroad. Analysts say they expect slower housing sales this year compared with 2013's sharp upturn as many genuine home buyers made purchases last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts said that a property crash isn't in the cards for China in the near term, noting that housing demand still is strong in the biggest cities. "The government is targeting gross-domestic-product growth of 7.5% and M2 growth of 13%, and if these targets are reached, there would still be sufficient liquidity that would make its way into the property market," CBRE's Mr. Chen said. </p>

</div><div class="author">Brett Arends </div><div>1145 words</div><div>28 March 2014</div><div>09:42</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE GOOD TIMES are rolling again in the country's toniest neighborhoods. Property prices in East Hampton, New York City and Beverly Hills were up about 10 percent last year, according to Zillow, a Seattle-based site that estimates home values. Near Miami, on the exclusive Fisher Island—which can be reached only by private ferry, and even then, only by those whose names appear on a special list—home prices are up by about a third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher real-estate prices normally spell good news for sellers, but there's an associated cost that many tend to forget: A property will probably generate much higher estate taxes upon the owner's death than it would have a few years ago. What's more, estate taxes have been rising faster than property prices and asset values—and, some experts say, they are likely to rise even further. Yet some legal maneuvering may help cushion the blow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the federal estate tax kicks in on estates worth more than $5.34 million, with the rate topping out at 40 percent. Since anyone is allowed to leave an unlimited amount of money to their spouse, the effective exemption per couple comes out to about $10.7 million. The low point for the estate-tax rate came in 2010, when it was effectively zero—thanks to political dysfunction on Capitol Hill that led to a one-year hiatus on the tax. As a result, the heirs of a handful of billionaires—including late <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> owner George Steinbrenner—got to keep hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to Uncle Sam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, those savings are not available today. Indeed, the growing economic inequality in America means that, if anything, estate-tax rates are likely to rise. Even as recently as the 1970s, the top federal estate-tax rate on the richest Americans was 77 percent. If the economic disparity continues to widen, today's 40 percent rate may seem temptingly low to a future <span class="companylink">Congress</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news? The federal tax code has more loopholes than a 100-foot scarf created by a team of injured knitters, including a couple of big ones that might be especially useful here. The first allows someone to transfer a home to an heir through a temporary trust known as a qualified personal residence trust, or QPRT (pronounced cue-pert). This trust can make time your friend, rather than your enemy, for estate-tax purposes, as it can sharply reduce the taxable value of a home. A $10 million home transferred to an heir via a seven-year QPRT, for instance, would only count as an $8.6 million home. Since the beneficiary wouldn't get their hands on the property for another seven years, the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> would allow the estate to discount the value by a few percentage points for each year's delay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even better, once the home is transferred to an heir, all future price appreciation gets excluded from the taxable value. If, for instance, that private-island home increases in value by, say, 7 percent a year and you die 10 years from now, then without the trust your estate would have to pay taxes on a $20 million home. With the trust, the taxes would be on a home valued at $8.6 million. Depending on your exact circumstances, that difference could end up saving your estate as much as $5 million in taxes. There are some caveats, of course, the main one being that you have to outlive the trust to get the benefit. Otherwise, the full value of the home reverts to your estate. Moreover, once the home is transferred, it is in the hands of your heirs, even if you live for 20 more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another little-known strategy is to transfer the home to a family-controlled limited liability company and then give shares in the LLC to beneficiaries each year. This could slash a future estate-tax bill a few different ways. First, a person could claim an estate-tax discount on the value of each share in the LLC, because it's a minority stake in a private company. So, even though a 1 percent share in a $10 million beach house in the Hamptons ought to be worth $100,000, for estate-tax purposes, it might be valued at only $85,000—or even less. Second, one could slice $14,000 more off the taxable value—for each beneficiary, each year—with the federal gift-tax exclusion. That could bring the taxable value of that $100,000 share down to $71,000. Finally, once a share is given, it and its future price appreciation are excluded from the estate, up to the $14,000 gift-tax exclusion per person. Put another way, even if a home is worth $20 million, its total taxable value to an estate would be considerably less once a person dies in 10 years' time—again, saving millions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts prefer the LLC route. Over time, it can allow for a "substantial wealth transfer at no cost to the parent," says Eric Rothenberg, a tax attorney with a law firm based in Needham, Mass. But the big issue with an LLC is determining how much of a discount can be claimed on each share. In the past, some have claimed a discount of as much as 40 percent, meaning they have transferred $100,000 worth of shares for as little as $60,000 in taxable value, "but that's aggressive," says Bob Glovsky, a financial planner at Colony Group, a wealth-management firm that is based in Boston and has around $3.3 billion in assets under management. He warns that claiming too much might mean a challenge from the IRS. If the government agency succeeds, the investor would lose the savings—and owe additional interest as well as penalties. For these reasons, Glovsky recommends opting for the QPRT instead of the LLC. What's more, the discounts used on a QPRT are based on tables that are published by the IRS—so they aren't open to challenge. And, Glovsky says, the trusts are often simpler to set up as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most well-off folks, of course, remember to get sound legal advice on these kinds of matters. It might help during the process to keep in mind that some say the estate tax is among the least obnoxious forms of taxes, because it is levied neither on toil nor on entrepreneurship, but on the good fortune of inheritance. And even though you might ultimately have to pay the tax in the end, the U.S. tax code—fortunately—contains some breaks for the well-informed.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lisa Selin Davis   </div><div>851 words</div><div>28 March 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even small spaces can require large mortgages in competitive markets like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not unusual to need a $1 million mortgage on a 700-square-foot property," says Peter Grabel, mortgage loan originator at Luxury Mortgage Corp., a mortgage firm based in Stamford, Conn. "We're setting all-time limits of cost per square foot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2011 and 2013, 95 condos, co-ops and single-family homes measuring under 800 square feet sold for more than $800,000 in San Francisco, according to the real estate data company Property Shark. One 360-square-foot condo sold for $950,000, or $2,639 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that same time period in New York City, 1,710 properties of less than 800 square feet sold for more than $800,000. The average price per square foot of these units was $1,423. The smallest unit, 410 square feet, sold for $855,000 in 2013, or $2,085 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, smaller units may be the better bargain: often the bigger the property is, the higher the price per square foot. Larger units in many neighborhoods are more desirable, thus more expensive and more likely to appreciate faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New York housing prices have been trending higher with a bigger emphasis on larger, family-sized apartments, generally with three or more bedrooms and especially within the new development market," says Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and consulting firm. "There have been sales of one-bedroom units priced from $2 million to $3 million that are neighbors with family-sized units selling well above $20 million." The reason for the high price of the small units is that they share the amenities and cachet of the larger units at the same address, says Mr. Miller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't always easy to get a jumbo loan (defined as more than $417,000 in most markets and more than $625,500 in pricey areas such as New York and San Francisco) for a small space. Some lenders have minimum square footage requirements. According to Hillary Legrain, a mortgage loan officer with <span class="companylink">First Savings Mortgage Corporation</span>, in Bethesda, Md., many jumbo lenders have a 500-square-foot-minimum size requirement on a condominium. "The reason behind that is that those size properties are less marketable," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets like New York and San Francisco, a jumbo mortgage on a tiny place is less of an issue, since there are many comparable properties. According to the real estate website Zillow, high prices for homes under 800 square feet are concentrated in coastal markets. Along with San Francisco and New York, markets seeing luxury prices for diminutive homes include: Orange County, Calif.; Honolulu; Miami Beach, Fla; and the Nantucket-Martha's Vineyard, Mass., area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, in Greenwich, Conn., only one luxury property under 800 square feet was sold for more than $780,000 in 2013, according to Zillow. In markets like this, with only a smattering of these properties, securing a jumbo mortgage for a small home can be trickier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lenders generally won't approve a mortgage on any size home unless they can get an appraisal that shows similar properties routinely sell the same amount or more as the property in question," says Guy Cecala, chief executive and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. "And getting those appraisals can be hard to get if you want to buy the 'best,' or most expensive, small home in a given area."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there aren't many comparable properties, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage-information firm HSH.com, "that might limit the number of lenders among whom the borrower would shop, and lenders who do make these loans may or may not have a full menu of product available." Mr. Gumbinger says that lenders may choose only to offer one product, like an adjustable-rate mortgage, or could potentially add a premium to either the interest rate or the fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Grabel says the square footage likely won't affect the loan terms, provided the lender is comfortable otherwise. "As long as you can find an appraisal to show that the value is reasonable," he says, "there's no special treatment you'd get other than, 'Wow I can't believe it's so expensive.' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some issues to consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Expansion plans: If you purchase a small co-op or condo with an eye toward someday expanding into the unit next door, there's no guarantee that the co-op or condo board will approve the expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Consider a larger down payment: In markets where there are few jumbo loans for tiny dwellings and the appraisal is an issue, buyers could consider a larger down payment to secure a government-backed or otherwise nonjumbo loan.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The number of people signing contracts to buy previously owned homes fell again in February, a sign of harsh weather and rising mortgage rates restraining buyers ahead of the spring house-hunting season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday its seasonally adjusted index for pending sales of existing homes dropped 0.8% in February from a month earlier to 93.9, its eighth straight month of declines. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected a 0.2% rise in pending home sales for February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's reading was the lowest since October 2011, after hitting a recent peak of 110.8 in June. From a year ago, the pending-home-sales index was down 10.5%. An index of 100 is equal to the average level of activity during 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The report remains broadly disappointing as the spring rebound in housing activity will likely have to wait another month," said <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> strategist Gennadiy Goldberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report measures signed contracts to purchase new homes. It typically takes one to two months to complete the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, pending home sales fell in the northeast and south in February, but rose in the Midwest and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report comes after a string of figures showed the housing market struggling. A stormy, cold winter may have led some potential buyers to stay indoors. Rising prices and mortgage rates could hurt affordability for some prospective home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly constructed homes were down in February, the Commerce Department said earlier this week. Existing-home sales, which represent about 90% of home purchases, fell for the sixth time in seven months, the Realtors group said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage ranged between 4.23% and 4.37% in February, up nearly one percentage point from a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were up 13.5% in January from a year earlier across 10 major U.S. cities, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home-price report earlier this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending sales report comes as other elements of the economy show signs of thawing after a winter chill. Last month, the pace of hiring was the strongest since November. Manufacturing output and retail sales both advanced in February after declining in January.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Recovery Needs More Than Thaw</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring is here and so, too, is an important test of housing's strength. It isn't a sure thing that the housing market will pass it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-market data have been shaky lately, and there is little doubt a harsh winter played a role. Not as many buyers will tramp through snow drifts to an open house, and home builders aren't going to break ground on as many new homes when sites are frozen solid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So few will be surprised, or fazed, if the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> report on pending-home sales Thursday is weak. Indeed, economists estimate the pending-sales index -- which measures contract signings for previously owned homes -- rose just 0.2% in February from January. That would put it 9.4% below its year-earlier mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As warmer weather arrives, home sales should heat up. But the thaw may be less than hoped for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although much of the recent weakness in housing has been concentrated in parts of the country most affected by winter weather, other areas haven't been spared. The January pending-home-sales report showed contract signings in the West were 17.5% below their year-earlier level. That trend looks to have continued last month: The <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> reported Tuesday that its pending-sales index was 12.1% lower in February than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One headwind housing faces is that homes have gotten less affordable. As of January, home prices were 12% higher than a year earlier nationally, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, with prices up significantly more in some states. In California, prices were 20.3% higher. Long-term interest rates are higher, too, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate at 4.32% in the latest week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, versus 3.54% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than prices and rates, the important factor holding housing back is a lack of first-time buyers. One sign of that: The <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers' Association</span>'s weekly index of mortgages extended for home purchases is 16.9% below its year-ago level and 61% below its decade-ago level. With unemployment high, wage growth meager and banks still cautious on extending credit, it is hard for younger Americans to find funds to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until that changes, the housing recovery's roots will be shallow.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Concentrating on London and the southeast helped U.K. house builder <span class="companylink">Bellway PLC</span> to a 13.1% increase in the average price of its homes in the first half of the financial year, Chief Financial Officer Keith Adey said Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adey told The Wall Street Journal that the biggest contributor to the higher prices was <span class="companylink">Bellway</span>'s increased focus on London, where houses sell for 55% more on average than in the U.K. as a whole, according to data for January published by the <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London sales accounted for 25% of revenue in the first half, up from 18% a year earlier, Mr. Adey said. That was only partly the result of selling more houses. <span class="companylink">Bellway</span> also sold higher-value properties—such as a development in Chelsea where 25 homes went for an average of £800,000 pounds, in comparison to the cheaper properties <span class="companylink">Bellway</span> mostly sells in the capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices in the capital have also risen faster than the company expected. "Our experience is that where we're bringing new sites to the market that we maybe bought 12 to 18 months ago, we're seeing net pricing gains above expectations of 5% plus," Mr. Adey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Away from London, other factors helped push prices up, Mr. Adey said. For instance, in the north of England <span class="companylink">Bellway</span> sold fewer starter homes and more large family houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bellway</span> is unlikely to increase its presence in London much further. "Our exposure in London could increase but I don't think it will increase vastly from the 25% of turnover we achieved in the first half," Mr. Adey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although competition for land has increased in the southeast of England, <span class="companylink">Bellway</span> isn't yet having trouble securing sites cheap enough to develop profitably, Mr. Adey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1015 GMT, shares were up 70 pence or 4.4% at 1,677 pence.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New-home sales fell in February, the latest sign of severe weather and rising mortgage rates slowing the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes fell 3.3% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. January's strong gain was revised down, to an annual rate of 455,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home-sales data represent a small portion of homes purchased in the U.S. and can be subject to large revisions. But they provide a more current gauge of market conditions than some other indicators because they are tallied at the moment a contract is signed rather than at its closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's sales were below the 445,000 rate forecast by economists. The average rate for the first two months of the year is roughly unchanged from that for the final three months of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend in sales is flat," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. "The upward trend of 2012 and early 2013 is gone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have been rebounding since 2011, but they have been rocky over the past 12 months as buyers grappled with rising mortgage rates and soaring housing prices. More recently, cold and stormy weather has discouraged some prospective buyers from going house-hunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which represent about 90% of home purchases, fell in February for the second consecutive month. These data represent sales contracts that were closed in February but signed a month or two earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve last week signaled a more aggressive path for future interest-rate increases than many investors were expecting, which could put more upward pressure on mortgage rates in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.32% for the week ended last Thursday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is down slightly from the previous week but up nearly one percentage point from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent home-price pressure, however, may be easing. The Commerce Department report showed the median price for a new home sold in February fell 1.2% from the same period a year earlier to $261,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate gauge released Tuesday showed strong house-price gains moderating slightly in January. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of prices for 10 major U.S. cities rose 13.5% in the year ended in January, down from 13.6% in December.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York and Washington, D.C., each booked their highest year-over-year gains since 2006. Phoenix saw its annual rate decelerate the most, but it was still up 13.8% year over year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—Inflation cooled in the U.K. to its lowest annual rate for more than four years in February, strengthening the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s case for keeping interest rates low to underpin an economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Office for National Statistics</span> said the annual rate of inflation in Britain fell to 1.7% in February from 1.9% a month earlier, driven largely by a fall in gasoline prices. Annual inflation was last lower in October 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in inflation in the U.K. mirrors an easing of inflationary pressures across the developed world. Faced with rapidly-cooling inflation in the 18 nations that use the euro, the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> has come under pressure to introduce new stimulus measures to head off the threat of deflation, or sustained falls in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said the slowdown in inflation in the U.K. is unlikely to prompt similar calls in Britain, where inflation has outstripped wages for much of the past six years, squeezing consumers' spending power. But economists said the decline should cement BOE officials' commitment to keep borrowing costs down to nurture a stronger recovery. The BOE has held its benchmark rate at 0.5% since March 2009 and traders expect officials to keep it there until early next year to spur growth and reduce unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the moment, there is no need to consider tightening monetary policy," said David Kern, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">British Chambers of Commerce</span>. "The current economic environment of low inflation and low interest rates should make it easier for businesses to plan ahead and invest."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central bank forecasts published in February show officials anticipate that annual inflation will stay around the BOE's 2% target throughout the next two or three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONS data suggest inflationary pressures in the U.K. economy remain subdued, supporting the BOE's forecast. Earnings rose just 1.4% on average in the three months to January, while figures Tuesday showed wholesale prices rose 0.5% on the year in February, the slowest annual gain since September 2009. Companies' raw material costs tumbled 5.7%, driven by a fall in the price of oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One area where prices are rising fast is in the housing market, data show, stoking fears the U.K. is at risk of experiencing a potentially damaging real estate bubble. Average house prices rose 6.8% on the year in January, the ONS said, compared with a 5.5% increase a month earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">James Glynn </div><div>501 words</div><div>25 March 2014</div><div>18:22</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYDNEY—<span class="companylink">Australia's central bank</span> said it would continue to monitor a surge in speculative lending for property, saying some measures of real-estate risk appetite resemble boom-like conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With roughly 40% of all mortgage lending now going to property investors in key states such as New South Wales, there is a danger that "unrealistic" expectations of home-price growth are building, the central bank said in its twice-a-year review of financial stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The share of households favoring real estate has risen to a level approaching that of the early-2000s property boom," the reserve bank said in the report. At that time, house prices nationally roughly doubled in the space of five years, prompting the reserve bank to raise interest rates sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank has been ramping up its warnings in recent months over home prices, which are rising at close to 10% per year nationally. It first raised the alarm late last year when data began to reveal a disproportionate number of people buying homes for investment purposes compared with those seeking property to move into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates have been at record lows since August to support a sluggish economy and guard against a rise in unemployment, which hit a decade high at the start of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cheap cost of funds also has fed a surge in house prices across the country, the largest gains being posted in major markets such as Sydney and Melbourne where foreign investment—especially from China—is also helping to drive growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge has fed fears of a house-price bubble that would destabilize the country's banks and economy if it were to burst suddenly. Australian house prices have risen solidly over recent decades, avoiding the crash that happened in places such as the U.S. during the global financial crisis in 2008-09.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While near-term house price risks appear contained, the speculative property market will be "monitored closely for signs of excessive lending and lending practices," the central bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remarks come amid a debate about whether the country's prudential regulator should move to toughen rules governing lending for housing, to take some heat out of price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank said earlier this month that it had discussed so-called macro-prudential tools, looking at the experience of places such as New Zealand, where it is hoped that new lending restrictions will help tame house prices without damping the broader economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank on Wednesday also said that while there was a general undersupply of housing in Australia, there remained some risk that pockets of oversupply might occur, triggering price falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a decade-long mining investment booms fades in Australia, economic growth is expected to remain weak through this year. The reserve bank said this month that interest rates were likely to remain low for "some time."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appreciation in home prices across the U.S. slowed slightly in January as a harsh winter dampened several aspects of the housing market, according to a report released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price report, the home price index covering 10 major U.S. cities increased 13.5% in the year ended in January. The 20-city price index advanced 13.2%, close to the 13.5% gain expected by economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing recovery may have taken a breather due to the cold weather," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "From the bottom in 2012, prices are up 23% and the housing market is showing signs of moving forward with more normal price increases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebounding home values in the past year played a large role in the rise in household wealth in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the 10-city index was unchanged in January over December, while the 20-city index declined by 0.1% for the third month in a row. Seasonally adjusted, each composite increased 0.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, "the Sunbelt showed the five highest monthly returns," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas led with an increase of 1.1%, followed by Miami, up 0.7%. San Diego posted its best January gain since 2004, up 0.6%. New York and Washington, D.C., each booked their highest year-over-year gain since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix saw its annual rate decelerate the most after peaking last January, when it led all 20 cities by a wide margin, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the continuing rise in home value, the report may mark the onset of a slower appreciation as higher mortgage rates and home prices eat into affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Expectations and recent data point to continued home price gains for 2014. Although most analysts do not expect the same rapid increases we saw last year, the consensus is for moderating gains," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer cited sales of existing homes in February slipping to their lowest level since July 2012.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Alan Zibel   </div><div>374 words</div><div>25 March 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. bank regulators proposed rules aimed at improving the accuracy of home appraisals by boosting the qualifications of those assessing property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is part of a postfinancial-crisis attempt to overhaul the appraisal industry and ensure that those assessing a home's value have no hidden financial ties to lenders that could influence assessments. Appraisers have been criticized for too-high estimates of home values during the housing boom, as well as overly conservative estimates during the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2010 Dodd-Frank law required bank regulators to establish minimum standards for state-led regulation of "appraisal management companies" hired by lenders to select appraisers. Such companies are often owned by banks or other real-estate firms and take a cut of the appraisal fee paid by consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have increasingly turned to these companies in recent years to comply with regulations requiring that they use independent appraisers. The shift has prompted concerns from real-estate agents and home buyers that appraisals were coming in below actual value and were of poor quality, causing real-estate deals to fall apart. Lenders require appraisals to ensure that they aren't taking an unnecessary risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 2010 research paper by economist Leonard Nakamura of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span> found the appraisal process "can go awry and often has." Home appraisals have typically been inflated because lenders and sellers have an incentive to make a deal go through, he found. But when home prices fell during the housing bust, appraisers were likely to overshoot downward because of a high number of foreclosed homes flooding the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal by the <span class="companylink">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</span>, <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and other regulators mandates that appraisal-management companies hired by federally regulated banks use only state-licensed appraisers with "the requisite education, expertise, and experience necessary" to complete appraisals competently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major owners of appraisal-management companies include <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span>., DataQuick and <span class="companylink">Fidelity National Financial Inc</span>. They didn't provide comments to email requests.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHANGZHOU, China—Groups of angry homeowners put up banners and demanded their money back after Hong Kong-listed property developer Wharf Ltd. cut prices on new homes in an eastern Chinese city, in the latest sign of stress in the nation's property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 20 homeowners picketed outside a property showroom in Changzhou Saturday, demanding to meet executives of the developer. They said they wanted their money back after prices at the project, called Phoenix Lake Garden, were cut by as much as 16%, according to the protesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, there was also a small disturbance at a second project called Ambassador House in the same city after the same developer cut prices there. According to property agency <span class="companylink">Soufun Holdings</span>, Wharf cut prices of 20 apartments in the project to 8,200 yuan ($1,317) per square meter, down from the average 11,000 yuan per square meter it recorded in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wharf, give us justice. Return us our hard earned money," read one of the banners, held up on bamboo poles outside the Phoenix Lake Garden showroom of a project for mid- to high-end apartments and villas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We aren't speculators. We just want an explanation from the developer," said one 35-year-old home buyer, who said he had bought an apartment and gave his surname as Wu. "This is very unfair."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others said that as many as 100 people who had bought homes at the project had vented their frustrations outside the showroom over the past week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the incidents, Wharf officials in Beijing didn't comment directly on the disturbances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"China's housing market has already become very market-based, price adjustment according to market changes is a normal market behavior," Wharf said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. The price adjustment at Phoenix Lake Garden is focused on selling off inventory, Wharf added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a four-year campaign by the government to cool spiraling property prices, rises in home prices are starting to slow and in some smaller cities they are weakening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in average housing prices in 70 Chinese cities moderated in February for the second-straight month though they were still nearly 9% higher compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But weaker economic growth, slower home sales and rising volumes of unsold houses have convinced developers in a number of cities to cut prices to raise cash quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in newer home prices hasn't gone down well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furniture at the showroom of Wharf's Ambassador House was knocked over and the wooden stands for advertisements for the homes were flung on top of a model of the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the Phoenix Lake Garden showroom, Mr. Wu said he bought a 120-square-meter apartment in December, for 730,000 yuan. Prices are now 610,000 yuan for a similar apartment in the same tower, he said. "If prices are now cut, does it mean the property developer would cut corners?" he added.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ryan Tracy </div><div>1206 words</div><div>21 March 2014</div><div>13:58</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s annual test of big banks' financial health showed the largest U.S. firms are strong enough to withstand a severe economic downturn, a sign that many will get the green light soon to reward investors by raising dividends and buying back shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said 29 of the 30 largest institutions have enough capital to continue lending even when faced with a hypothetical jolt to the U.S. economy lasting into 2015, including a severe drop in housing prices and a spike in unemployment. The Fed's annual "stress tests" are designed to ensure large banks can withstand severe losses during times of market turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only <span class="companylink">Zions Bancorp</span> , a regional lender based in Salt Lake City, posted capital levels during the two-year-downturn scenario that didn't meet the Fed's minimum standards. The Fed said Zions had a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 3.6%, below the 5% level the Fed views as a minimum allowance. The ratio measures high-quality capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets such as mortgages, commercial loans and securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results could buttress the desire of banks—which have seen their profits soar amid an improving economy and severe cost cutting—to return more of that income to shareholders. The six biggest banks earned $76 billion in 2013, just $6 billion shy of their collective all-time high. All U.S. banks earned a record $154.6 billion, according to data compiled by <span class="companylink">SNL Financial</span>. Some of the biggest financial institutions, including <span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span> . and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> , haven't boosted dividend payouts since the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stress-test results will be a factor in the Fed's decision next week to approve or deny individual banks' plans for returning billions of dollars to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. But a good performance on Thursday's test is no guarantee, since the Fed also will consider more subjective factors such as the strength of a bank's internal risk management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday afternoon, the Fed was expected to privately give banks a preliminary answer on their requests, setting up a week of jockeying for banks that were told "no." Firms will have until early next week to revise their plans or challenge the Fed's math before a final decision is issued Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said the results bode well for banks' approval of capital plans. "There's nothing in here that I think is a big shocker," he said. Analysts this year are expecting distributions from banks to be the highest since at least 2007, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters for The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first stress test took place in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 crisis and helped shore up confidence at a critical juncture for the American financial system. Regulators forced banks to cut their dividends in exchange for billions of dollars in government aid and lenders were prohibited from raising shareholder payouts without U.S. approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed said the latest tests show banks are "collectively better positioned" to withstand losses than they were during the financial crisis, after which regulators pushed banks to hold more loss-absorbing capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Fed's "severely adverse" scenario—a deep recession with a rising unemployment rate, steep drop in housing prices and a nearly 50% decline in stock prices over nine quarters—30 banks would have suffered total loan losses of $366 billion, trading losses of $98 billion and a net loss before taxes of $217 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also raised the bar in this year's test by making its own projections for each bank's balance sheets, assuming that assets would increase during the stressful period rather than decrease as banks had assumed. That required the firms to hold more capital. This year's test also forced eight big firms to contemplate the default of their largest trading counterparty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the largest banks, including <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co</span> ., and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> , were ranked near the bottom of the pack in the Fed's side-by-side comparison of bank capital levels over a nine-quarter period of severely adverse economic conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte, N.C.-based <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> was the worst performer among the biggest banks with a Tier 1 common ratio that dropped as low as 5.9% under the Fed's severe scenario, compared with 6.8% in last year's test.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most firms fared better than they did under last year's test, although a handful, including <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span> ., <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> , and <span class="companylink">Fifth Third Bancorp</span> ., had capital ratios dip lower than the 2013 results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-worst Tier 1 common ratio among the big banks belonged to <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> , at 6.1%. Capital ratios were as low as 6.3% at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> , 6.9% at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs Group Inc</span> . and 7.2% at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> . Those were far below firms such as <span class="companylink">Discover Financial Services</span> , which fell only as low as 13.2%, and <span class="companylink">The Bank of New York Mellon Corp</span> ., which fell only as low as 13.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several banks put out their own numbers after the Fed's release. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</span> . said its lowest capital ratio during the hypothetical downturn would have been 9.7%, higher than the Fed's 8.2%. <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> said its lowest ratio was 8.6%, compared with 5.9% from the Fed. J.P. Morgan put its lowest ratio at 6.5%, compared with the Fed's 6.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one bank came up with results that were lower than the Fed's. <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T Corp</span> . said its Tier 1 common ratio was 6.8%, compared with the Fed's projection of 8.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BB&amp;T Chief Financial Officer Daryl Bible said the company was "happy with how our processes went."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Discover Financial Services</span> was so confident about its performance that it disclosed on Thursday how much of a dividend increase—4 cents—it asked the Fed to approve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discover, <span class="companylink">Fifth Third</span> and <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> banking analyst Gerard Cassidy said as long as banks are over the 5% threshold, they should be allowed to increase dividends or buy back stock. "The bright line in the sand is 5%," he said. "If you're over 5%, you've passed. It's not a relative game."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zions was subjected to the Fed's stress tests for the first time this year. The bank said previously it likely would resubmit its capital plan given its recent move to sell certain debt securities, a process it undertook as a result of the recently enacted Volcker rule. A Zions spokesman said Thursday the bank expects to resubmit its plan in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article and chart have been updated to reflect the corrected results for banks' minimum Tier 1 capital ratios that were issued by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on March 21. The Fed corrected figures for 15 banks by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A broad measure of home sales fell again in February, the latest sign of severe weather and worsening affordability undermining the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 0.4% in February from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That matched a forecast by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and was the sixth decline in sales in the past seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Existing-home sales remain in a rut," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Laura Rosner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been on the decline since hitting an annual rate of 5.38 million in July, a four-year high. Rising mortgage rates and soaring home prices have sidelined many prospective buyers, while cold and stormy weather has dissuaded others from going house-hunting in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which account for more than 90% of all home purchases in the U.S., fell in the Northeast and Midwest but rose in the South and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said the median home price in February was $189,000, up 9.1% from a year earlier, in part because supply constraints are driving up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said two million homes were available for sale last month, which represents a supply of about 5.2 months. It estimates a supply of 6 to 6 1/2 months represents a rough balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is continuing to weaken," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, though he added sales activity should pick up after winter ends.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sanette Tanaka   </div><div>593 words</div><div>21 March 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of the country, $1 million buys a starter home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 4.6% of homes are priced at $1 million and above, according to an analysis of home listings by real-estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. But some areas are especially saturated with million-dollar listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, a whopping 43.5% of listings are priced at $1 million and above. Fairfield County, Conn., ranks second, with 29.7% of homes listed over $1 million, followed by San Jose, Calif., with 25.7% of listings topping the million-dollar mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In terms of million-dollar listings, there has been a huge, huge influx," says Paul Ybarbo, an agent with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in San Francisco. "If you're in a nice neighborhood and live in a nice building, it most likely will command a million-dollar price point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, San Francisco homes listed for roughly $1 million have a median size of 1,774 square feet, but can be much smaller. Mr. Ybarbo has a $1.15 million listing, currently under contract, for a one-bedroom apartment in Nob Hill that measures just over 1,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do the million-dollar listings translate to million-dollar sales? Typically, homes that sold for more than $1 million made up 1% of total U.S. home sales for the past decade. Since mid-2013, that number has risen to 2% of all sales, says Sam Khater, deputy chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, which specializes in mortgage and real-estate information. He expects the percentage of million-dollar sales to continue increasing so long as the stock market continues to improve and interest rates remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Million-dollar listings tend to be more common on the coasts and rarer in the Midwest and South. Less than 0.5% of listings are priced above $1 million in places like El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which are similar in terms of the number of overall listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Khater points out that two of the top three locations for high-price listings -- San Francisco and San Jose -- have thriving tech industries. "That says a lot about the changing nature of the economy," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spread between markets in the share of million-dollar listings is much larger than the spread in other home-price measures, like price per square foot, says Jed Kolko, chief economist and head of analytics at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "The prevalence of million-dollar listings shows how different the markets are at the extreme high end," he says. "Million-dollar listings are 50 times more common on Long Island [New York] than in Rochester, even though the median price per square foot is only 2.5 times higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, metro areas with high concentrations of pricey listings tend to sport homes with smaller square footage, according to the data. In urban areas like Miami and New York City, the square footage is brought down even further by pricey condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York metro area comes in sixth place on <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s list, with 20.8% of listings priced over $1 million. These homes also boast the least amount of space at 1,489 median square feet. Bo Poulsen, a real-estate agent with Town Residential, recently sold a one-bedroom unit in West Village for $1.2 million. Its size? A mere 633 square feet, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hedge Fund Magnate Makes Second Big</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamptons Buy for $93.9 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just months after his $75 million purchase of Wooldon Manor in Southampton -- the most expensive Hamptons deal in 2013 -- Scott A. Bommer is in contract to buy three parcels in East Hampton for a total of $93.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the sale closes, it will be one of the priciest deals ever in the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bommer, the founder of hedge fund SAB Capital, has signed an agreement to purchase adjoining lots on Lily Pond Lane that total 6.2 acres, according to people familiar with the situation. Two of the lots -- a nearly 2-acre oceanfront parcel with a large white house on it, and an adjacent vacant lot -- are owned by financier Maurice Cunniffe of investment firm Vista Capital. According to public records, Mr. Cunniffe bought the oceanfront lot in 1993 for $3.3 million, and the adjacent parcel in 1996 for $3.5 million. Mr. Cunniffe didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third parcel, measuring 2.8 acres, is owned by telecommunications executive Allen Salmasi, who purchased it in 2007 for $17.5 million, according to public documents. That property had been listed for $19.45 million and has a five-bedroom main house, a guesthouse and a pool, according to the listing. Mr. Salmasi couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Bommer and his wife, Donya, paid $75 million to buy the 14.5-acre Wooldon Manor parcel from fashion designer Vince Camuto. When the East Hampton properties became available, Mr. Bommer decided to purchase them, according to people familiar with the situation. So he's put Wooldon Manor back on the market for $98 million with Ed Petrie and Harald Grant of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, and <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>'s Tim Davis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grant said a buyer could choose to purchase only part of the Wooldon Manor estate -- the house and surrounding 5.2 acres are asking $48 million, while the four adjacent lots are priced at $15 million each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bommer and his wife have also set real-estate records in New York City. Their 2008 sale of an apartment at 1060 Fifth Avenue for $48.8 million was a record price for a New York co-op at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oprah Winfrey Buys About 60 Acres in</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telluride for $10.85 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oprah Winfrey has purchased about 60 acres of land near Telluride Ski Resort in Colorado, a spokesperson for Ms. Winfrey confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Winfrey plans to build a home on the site, according to people familiar with the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a deal that closed earlier this week, Ms. Winfrey paid $10.85 million through an entity called Yellow Brick Road CO LLC for the property in Mountain Village, according to public records. Bob Greene, her longtime friend and business consultant, helped facilitate the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers were Carol Barnett, daughter of <span class="companylink">Publix Super Markets</span> founder George Jenkins, and her husband, Hoyt Barnett. "We're happy that they're the buyers," Ms. Barnett said. "I know they'll do a great job with what they build." There are restrictions in place limiting the amount of building on the wooded parcel, Ms. Barnett said, but a main house and a guesthouse can be built there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, off Rocky Road, can be accessed via Telluride's Galloping Goose ski trail and has "dramatic mountain views," said Sandy Sucharski of Telluride Real Estate, an exclusive affiliate of <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>. Ms. Sucharski, who represented the sellers along with Telluride Real Estate's Steve Catsman, said the property wasn't on the market, but that the owners were approached about selling it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Barnett said she and her husband have been coming to Telluride for 29 years, and own a condo in Mountain Village. They purchased this property about 20 years ago, with the intention of building a home there, she said. But as their children grew older, they spent less time in Telluride and the idea of building a house became less attractive -- especially now that there is gondola service in between Mountain Village and the town of Telluride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After that gondola was up and running and very convenient, it lessened our interest in building a house, since we already had a condo that was very convenient," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Winfrey, chairman and CEO of OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, is no stranger to Telluride. In fact, she first expressed interest in buying the Barnetts' property about 10 years ago, but they weren't ready to sell at the time, Ms. Barnett said. When Ms. Winfrey expressed interest again more recently, "we decided it was the right thing to do," Ms. Barnett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Hintermeister of Telluride Sotheby's International Realty, who isn't involved in the deal, said the parcel has views and ski-in and ski-out access, but is "really secluded." He added that Ms. Winfrey's new property is the largest in Mountain Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modern Hamptons Home Sells for $20 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Hamptons home designed by the late modernist architect Charles Gwathmey has sold for $20 million, according to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, the brokerage that handled the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Sagaponack, N.Y., the nearly 8,000-square-foot, cedar-shingle home is built around an open-air courtyard. It has seven bedrooms, 11 1/2 bathrooms, a media room, fitness room and wine cellar. On the grounds there is a gunite pool with a hot tub, a tennis court and a pool house. The house, with a lead-coated copper roof, has a round turret intended to resemble a barn, in homage to the agricultural landscape. It also has deeded ocean access and a spiral staircase that leads to an upstairs office with an ocean view, said Corcoran's Susan Breitenbach, the agent who handled the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gwathmey, who died in 2009, designed a number of homes in the Hamptons throughout his career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was sold to an undisclosed buyer by investor Jonathan Sobel, a former <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> executive, and his wife, ophthalmologist Dr. Marcia Dunn. They purchased the 2 1/2-acre property for $2.575 million in 2003, according to public records. They then commissioned Mr. Gwathmey to build the home and furnishings for them, said Ms. Breitenbach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple is moving because they are building a new home nearby, said Ms. Breitenbach, who declined to identify the buyers. The house was sold with all its furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was initially listed for $28 million several years ago, and its asking price was discounted several times as the listing changed agents. The home wasn't officially listed when it sold, said Ms. Breitenbach, because the buyers had decided to wait until their new home was ready before selling the old one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soap Included: A Fully Stocked L.A. Spec Home to List for $38 Million</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spec home in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles that comes fully stocked -- down to the towels, soap and even toothbrushes -- will soon list for $38 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to owner Sean Sassounian, the roughly 13,000-square-foot, limestone-clad house has five bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and three half-bathrooms and comes fully furnished, with most pieces custom-made for the home. A massage room on the lower level comes with a table, towels and massage oil. Three bars throughout the house are stocked with high-end scotch, cognac and tequila, and the 1,100-bottle wine cellar is full. Some of the bathrooms even have toothbrushes in them, the owner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sassounian, the 41-year-old founder of SAS Textiles who did this house as a side project, also decorated the home with art from his personal collection and said a local gallery chose other displayed pieces, including a work by Andy Warhol. The new house also has an elevator, three full kitchens -- including one outside -- a gym and a home theater. There is an eight-car garage and an infinity-edge swimming pool with city views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sassounian said he bought this property six years ago for roughly $4.5 million and demolished the existing home on the site. When asked why he went to such extremes to stock the new house, Mr. Sassounian said he wanted to use pieces consistent with the lifestyle of the eventual buyer. "Staging is very generic," he said. "I didn't think it would convey the right image." Instead, he "curated the best stuff I could get for the house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everything in the house is included in the sale price except the wine and the art, he said. While buyers can choose to buy the wine, the art is generally not for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agents are Alejandro Aldrete, Blair Chang and Mauricio Umansky of the Agency.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Princeton, N.J., guest apartment for rent has a Boffi-designed kitchen. A Mansion article on Friday about luxury homeowners renting out rooms incorrectly described the kitchen as having appliances by Boffi.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lauren Duff, a 28-year-old accountant, lives in a Denver mansion she found on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I took a gamble," says Ms. Duff, who signed the lease in 2009 with two roommates. She hit the jackpot: The listing was for a 1,900-square-foot, three-bedroom wing of an approximately 6,000-square-foot Mediterranean home that is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners, recent empty nesters, were looking for someone to check in on their French-style estate -- and their cat, Tigger -- while they traveled. "Lo and behold, these wonderful, young, professional tenants came along," says homeowner Bert Furmansky, a 68-year-old psychiatrist who lives under the same roof with his wife Dyana and three tenants. Dinner invites are common. The renters, who have their own entrance, parking spaces and pool access, pay a total of around $2,000 a month, a below-market rate for the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surprising number of luxury homeowners are taking on tenants for reasons both pecuniary and personal. Whether looking for a pet-sitter or a like-minded neighbor, owners are seeking out these arrangements to make the most of their space. These set ups can work out well, though things can get messy when these homes go on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a situation that may be more common than it seems. The Demand Institute, a nonprofit research group run by the Conference Board and Nielsen, surveyed more than 10,000 homeowners and renters nationwide. The study, released in February, found that 5% of respondents across all markets were "doubling up" -- when two or more unrelated adults live together. But that number was 7% in the most affluent housing markets, which it defined as roughly the top 10% of communities based on a number of socioeconomic measures, including median home value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible reason is that luxury homeowners can be just as burdened by housing costs as the less affluent, says Louise Keely, chief research officer at the Demand Institute. Of the households in the top-tier markets that were polled, 41% said they spend 30% or more of their income on housing, which is the same percentage as in other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These owners "have similar incentives to find ways to make their homes more affordable, and renting them out is one way to do that," Ms. Keely says. And despite home prices rising at double-digit pace over the past two years, she adds, rents relative to home prices are still high, which makes becoming a landlord all the more appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, D.C., real-estate investors and property developers Jeff Printz, 43, and his partner, Chris Swanson, 45, were able to realize their unusual home project in part because of willing tenants. Their vision: to convert a 25,000-square-foot school into a luxury home with soaring ceilings, Carrara marble finishes and a master bathroom with a saltwater aquarium built into the shower wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought the late 19th-century building as a shell for $272,000 in 2000 and spent about $3 million to create a 9,400-square-foot duplex for themselves, plus nine additional rental units with personalized touches like replicas of the school's original chalkboards and a colorful mural of Albert Einstein. Now the rented units bring in about $21,000 a month, says their real-estate agent, Peter Lane of TTR Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rental market is hot all the time," Mr. Lane says about the D.C. area. There is a waitlist of tenants looking to move into the building, which includes a large pool area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But close quarters has its downsides. "It is very 'Melrose Place' here sometimes," Mr. Printz jokes, referring to the soapy TV drama. Once, Mr. Printz was hosting a weekday cocktail party when he got a text from a tenant: "OMG it's Tuesday at 1 a.m. -- do you mind?" He was mortified, but contrite. "It takes some [nerve] to tell your landlord to shut up." Still, he says he's friendly with all the tenants, and invites them over regularly for parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another downside: the potential consequences when the owner wants to sell. Looking to move onto their next project, converting a 1906 auto shop, Messrs. Printz and Swanson have listed their property for $6.5 million, down from $7.25 million in September. Mr. Lane, the agent, says part of the reason their home hasn't sold yet is the fact that the next owner will inherit nine tenants on one-year or month-to-month leases, all of whom expect professional rental services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gail Roberts, an agent with Coldwell Banker in Cambridge, Mass., says some buyers are averse to homes with existing tenants because of the legal hurdles that can arise, like a messy eviction. "Most people don't want to take on a house with someone else's leftover baggage," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is very difficult to sell something with a tenant," adds Tom Daley, an associate broker on the board of directors with the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors in Washington, D.C. He says having a legal rental unit in the home can boost the sales price and help the owner finance the property, but the trade-off can mean less privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Duff, who scored the Denver mansion on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, may have to move on as well. Her landlord Dr. Furmansky has listed his home for $1.425 million with Ken Miller of <span class="companylink">Kentwood City Properties</span>. So far most prospective buyers have wanted only the main house, but if one were interested in recombining the mansion by knocking down some walls, the tenants' wing could be purchased for an additional $460,000. Since the renters are on a month-to-month lease, the sale could force them to move. "It is going to break my heart if I stop living here," Ms. Duff says, in part because it has been so pleasant living with the owners. The couple have offered to sell the renters the unit, but it's unlikely they would buy it together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners say that having someone else in the home can be its own reward.

He bought the house in 2012 for about $2 million, thinking he would share the home with his girlfriend at the time. When the relationship ended, he had a lot of home, and two lonely chow dogs to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His housemate, Lori Amadei, a 37-year-old attorney, moved in about two months ago, after responding to a <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> ad.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—A broad measure of home sales fell again in February, the latest sign of severe weather and worsening affordability undermining the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 0.4% in February from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That matched a forecast by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and was the sixth decline in sales in the past seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Existing-home sales remain in a rut," said <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> economist Laura Rosner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been on the decline since hitting an annual rate of 5.38 million in July, a four-year high. Rising mortgage rates and soaring home prices have sidelined many prospective buyers, while cold and stormy weather has dissuaded others from going house-hunting in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales, which account for more than 90% of all home purchases in the U.S., fell in the Northeast and Midwest but rose in the South and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said the median home price in February was $189,000, up 9.1% from a year earlier, in part because supply constraints are driving up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade group said two million homes were available for sale last month, which represents a supply of about 5.2 months. It estimates a supply of 6 to 6½ months represents a rough balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability is continuing to weaken," said Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, though he added sales activity should pick up after winter ends. "Some transactions are simply being delayed, so there should be some improvement in the months ahead," Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New guidance from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday could put further upward pressure on mortgage rates in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Fed's official policy statement affirmed its plan to keep rates below their longer-run trend for the foreseeable future, the projections of individual officials did point to a slightly more aggressive path for interest-rate increases in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, a reference point for many loans to U.S. businesses and consumers including mortgage loans, rose Wednesday in response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.32% for the week ending Thursday, according to new figures from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That is down slightly from the prior week but is up nearly one percentage point from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity, a key driver of broader economic growth, has also slowed in recent months. U.S. housing starts fell by 0.2% in February and by 11.2% in January, though building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose by 7.7% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indicators have shown some signs the economy might be emerging from its recent soft patch. The pace of hiring last month was its strongest since November and manufacturing output recorded its biggest gain since August.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lauren Duff, a 28-year-old accountant, lives in a Denver mansion she found on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I took a gamble," says Ms. Duff, who signed the lease in 2009 with two roommates. She hit the jackpot: The listing was for a 1,900-square-foot, three-bedroom wing of an approximately 6,000-square-foot Mediterranean home that is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners, recent empty nesters, were looking for someone to check in on their French-style estate—and their cat, Tigger—while they traveled. "Lo and behold, these wonderful, young, professional tenants came along," says homeowner Bert Furmansky, a 68-year-old psychiatrist who lives under the same roof with his wife Dyana and three tenants. Dinner invites are common. The renters, who have their own entrance, parking spaces and pool access, pay a total of around $2,000 a month, a below-market rate for the area.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—Unusually cold weather chilled new-home construction in February, though underlying data signals a possible spring rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts decreased 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 907,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The slight decline came after starts tumbled 11.2% in January, though that month's pace was revised up from the previous estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a sign of future construction typically influenced less by weather, advanced 7.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.02 million last month. That was the best monthly gain since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of starts and permits were both above economists' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement in permits "is a welcomed reprieve" after January's broad fallout, said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee Group. But the overall report suggests "there is more than winter weather dampening construction activity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent housing reports suggest the sector might not break out of a winter slump as quickly as other elements of the economy. Last month, the pace of hiring was the strongest since November and manufacturing output recorded the best gain since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Severely cold weather can prevent builders from breaking ground and discourage would-be buyers from shopping. But home construction faces other headwinds, including elevated interest rates, a shortage of skilled workers and lack of available land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.37% last week, three-quarters of a percentage point above last year's mid-March level, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Higher interest rates make buying a house less affordable for borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of housing starts has doubled since the recent trough during the recession, but construction remains well below the 50-year historical average of 1.5 million starts a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The underlying data in Tuesday's report was split by housing type. The jump in permits was led by a 24.3% increase in multifamily properties, a segment that tends to be more volatile. But in a positive sign, single-family starts increased for the first time since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gap between starts and permits is widening," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "Since builders generally don't pay the money for permits unless they expect to do something with them, you can bet that once the warm weather returns, so will the bulldozers."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING—Gains in property prices in 70 Chinese cities continued to moderate in February after slowing in January for the first time in a year, as lending limits and concerns about more unsold homes hit demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average new home prices in 70 Chinese cities rose 8.19% in February from a year earlier, according to The Wall Street Journal's calculations based on data released Tuesday by the National Bureau of Statistics. Home prices in those cities rose 8.98% in January. Before that, gains had accelerated every month for the past year, most recently with prices up 9.17% in December from 9.10% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Month-on-month, prices rose 0.27% in February, down from 0.38% in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stripping out public housing, home prices rose 8.64% year-over-year in February, against 9.50% in January. The average month-on-month increase in February was 0.28%, lower than January's 0.4% increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in China surged last year despite government controls on the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese officials didn't announce new policy measures for the property market at the annual session of parliament earlier this month, but Xu Shaoshi, head of the <span class="companylink">National Development and Reform Commission</span>, the state planner, said the prosper sector has hidden risks. He didn't elaborate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In third and fourth tier cities, many of which aren't covered in the survey, oversupply heightens the risks of a sharp correction and credit defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, property developers in some cities such as Hangzhou, Changzhou and Ningbo have starting to offer discounts to clear inventory and to improve cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts say it is too early to gauge how much the property market might moderate in the coming months, as January and February are typically slower periods for home sales due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Sales in March and April are typically better indicators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average house prices in Guangzhou rose 15.7% in February from a year earlier, after jumping 18.6% in January. In Beijing, prices were up 12.2%, after rising 14.7% in January. Prices in Shanghai and Shenzhen gained 15.7% and 15.6% after rising 17.5% and 17.8% respectively in January. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON—U.S. home builders remained cautious about the housing market in March, suggesting a driver of the recovery might be sputtering for reasons beyond the severe winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence in the market for single-family homes rose just one point from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted 47 in March, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said Monday. Readings below 50 indicate more builders view conditions as poor than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase, which was smaller than expected, comes after a drop of 10 points in February, the biggest one-month decline on record. Builders reported they were slowed by poor weather, but also said they were also hampered by difficulties finding labor and land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The soft readings in the past two months might be dismissed because of the challenging weather, but detail of the report suggests some fundamental softening," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Capital Markets America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates remain elevated from a year ago, making houses less affordable for borrowers. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.37% last week, three-quarters of a percentage point above the mid-March level last year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Still, rates so far this year have remained below the recent 4.57% peak reached in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's report showed sales and traffic increased slightly in March, but sales expectations over the next six months declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A number of factors are raising builder concerns over meeting demand for the spring buying season," said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe. "These include a shortage of buildable lots and skilled workers, rising materials prices and an extremely low inventory of new homes for sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential investment, which includes home building, had contributed to the nation's economic growth for 12 straight quarters until the final three months of 2013, when it became a drag on gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey showed the housing sector isn't bouncing back as strongly from the winter chill as other pieces of the economy. In February, U.S. employers added the most jobs since November. Retail sales increased last month after declining the previous two, and factory output rose sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warmer spring could aid home builders. Unseasonably cold weather can delay construction of houses and discourage would-be buyers from shopping. Regionally, builder confidence was highest in the West and weakest in the Northeast. The western U.S. has generally dodged the icy winter that hammered much of the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry faced substantial volatility last year, losing momentum in the summer when interest rates started to rise but regaining its footing in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve this week will evaluate whether to again ratchet down its bond-buying program after cutting the pace of purchases twice since December to $65 billion a month. The stimulus program is intended to keep long-term interest rates low to spur stronger hiring and investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central-bank officials will also update their forecasts for when the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate from near zero. Changes to the federal funds rate influence rates on mortgages and other types of loans.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two fundamental reasons to be bearish on housing in China: prices have risen too far too fast, and the government is tightening lending. But there are four additional, subtler reasons, and all are related to new reforms from Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's home prices have doubled in the past five years, and they are still going up. In 2013, luxury property prices rose 17% in Beijing, the third-biggest gain among the top 30 global cities, after Jakarta and Dublin. In January, home prices rose in all but one of the top 70 Chinese cities, though the rate of appreciation has moderated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it is hard to see a property market crash in China. Underlying demand remains strong. The urban population continues to grow by 20 million people a year, and among existing urban residents at least 30 million households still live in units without a toilet or kitchen. Meanwhile, supply is stabilizing. Housing completions peaked at 10.7 million units in 2012 and declined slightly last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his annual government work report this month, for the first time in almost a decade Chinese Premier Li Keqiang didn't issue a warning about curbing home prices. But investors shouldn't overlook changes in other areas, such as interest-rate and exchange-rate liberalization and land reforms, which are also going to hit the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This government isn't interested in real-estate policies that merely scratch the surface," said Qian Shizheng, an accounting professor at <span class="companylink">Fudan University</span> and a former executive at a state-owned property firm. "They are introducing policies that should correct the distortions and make properties less attractive as an investment asset."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four under-appreciated factors are at play here. First, funding costs for banks have gone up, forcing them to pass on the higher costs to borrowers to protect their own profit margins, and to become choosier about borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks used to offer interest-rate discounts of up to 20% to attract mortgage demand. Now big banks are offering no discounts, while smaller banks are demanding a 10% premium on the regulated lending rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates are bad for asset prices. Rates should go up even more in the near future, as interest-rate deregulation accelerates. Chinese central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said this week that banks should be able to set their own deposit rates within two years, adding that interest rates will initially rise as controls are removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, exchange-rate liberalization may encourage more money outflows. Demand for properties in China has been high because Chinese investors lack good investment options. But that is changing. Wealthy Chinese are already significant buyers of properties in the U.S., UK, Canada, and Australia. Once the capital account opens up, more middle class Chinese may start to diversify their assets abroad, reducing investment demand for properties at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, land reforms will have a mixed impact on demand. China is overhauling the process of converting rural land to urban use and strengthening farmers' property rights. On the one hand, these moves should increase rural incomes, making urban housing more affordable for farmers as they move to cities. This should be positive for housing prices, especially at the low end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more compensation for farmers also means less revenue for local governments, which rely on land auctions for half of their income. That will push more governments to enforce a property holding tax, which is already being done on a trial basis in Shanghai and Chongqing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last, anti-corruption and state-owned company reforms will also likely weigh on housing prices. China is building a nationwide database of home information. More transparency which will make officials who own multiple properties more inclined to sell, increasing supply in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SOE reform may also have an impact. In 2010 the central government said that 78 SOEs whose core business isn't property should withdraw from the market. Although this may lead to reduced investment in new homes, less competition for land may lead to lower overall costs for developers, who can in turn pass the savings to buyers. This will also lead to cooling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government wants home prices merely to stabilize, which would please new buyers without antagonizing existing home owners. But that's a tough balance. "Given that each of the reforms is expected to progress at a measured pace, the individual impact on the property market from each one may be limited," said Oliver Barron, China research head for North Square Blue Oak, a UK broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, when the effects of capital-account liberalization, interest-rate reform and SOE reform are combined," added Mr. Barron. "We could see a notable decline in investment, both from companies that struggle to access capital and individuals who choose to invest elsewhere." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of new homes being built as rental apartments is at the highest level in at least four decades, as an improving jobs picture spurs younger Americans to form their own households but tighter lending standards make it more difficult to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction -- a pillar of the economy and employment -- is starting to ramp up again overall, but in previous years the growth was driven by single-family homes. Last year, according to census data, construction was started on a little less than one million new residential units, and about one in three of those was a rental in a multifamily building, the highest share since data began in the mid-1970s. Single-family homes accounted for about two-thirds of housing starts last year, down from their peak of 87% in 1993 and about 80% in the years leading up to the recession, the census data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move toward apartment construction reflects the convergence of several trends. Mortgage credit is still tight. Also, Americans have seen muted wage gains, and others have high student-debt loads, forcing people who otherwise would have bought homes to rent instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, as the job market improves, larger numbers of young adults are leaving their parents' homes and forming their own households -- adding more to the demand for rentals. And the supply of new apartments hasn't kept pace, especially in some key markets such as San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are betting on more millennials leaving the nest this year," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real-estate site. "But young people don't get a job one day and buy a home the next. The improving jobs picture for young adults will mean more renters this year, not a surge in first-time home buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shorter-term growth in rental demand is combining with long-run demographic trends that are expected to continue to tilt U.S. home construction toward "multifamily" units, a category that includes everything from garden-style apartments to towering condominiums. The baby-boom generation is moving into retirement and empty-nesthood, prompting many to downsize to smaller quarters. The generations behind them, meantime, are having fewer children, later in life, so need less space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Rappaport, an economist at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span>, projects that by the end of this decade, single-family-home construction will top out somewhere around its pre-housing-boom level of roughly 1.3 million new homes a year. Multifamily units, by contrast, are projected to increase to an annual rate of 550,000 new units a year, or roughly twice the rate of today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single most important factor behind housing demand is household formation, which is economist-speak for people leaving one household to form another -- an adult child leaving mom and dad's place, for instance, or when a house full of roommates breaks up into smaller groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Devon Stansbury, 24, who graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 2012. Ms. Stansbury has moved four times over the past few years, living with her parents and roommates before settling in her own one-bedroom apartment in Dallas's Galleria district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many in her generation, Ms. Stansbury believes she will continue renting into her 30s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I see [renting] for five years at the very minimum, maybe even up to 10," Ms. Stansbury said. "I am single, just focusing on my career. If something goes wrong here, maintenance will take care of it. And I feel safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect the U.S. this year to finally eclipse the 3% annual growth rate that has eluded its economy since 2005. Whether that happens or not will depend to a great degree on how much new housing is built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The category of gross domestic product that includes home building and renovations accounted for about 3% of growth last year, below the 4%-to-5% range that persisted before the housing boom and bust. And housing's overall contribution to the economy is actually several times as large when knock-on effects -- like commissions to real-estate agents or jobs at home-improvement stores -- are taken into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector already is starting to make up that ground, but a larger-than-normal share of it is coming from rental apartments. Champion Real Estate, a Los Angeles-based developer, has nine projects in the pipeline, totaling some 2,000 new units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is about three times as many as normal, said Bob Champion, the company's president. He expects the company to reach 15 employees this year, up from nine in 2012, and they are moving to new offices in June to accommodate them.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market faces a challenge at the start of the spring sales season: higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hard to overstate the benefits of rising prices to the economy broadly and to homeowners, banks and home builders specifically after years of declines. Price gains have pulled more Americans from the brink of foreclosure and given home buyers more confidence that they won't get stuck with an asset whose value will decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those gains have a painful edge, too, especially because prices have bounced back so strongly. The increases have rekindled concerns about affordability, particularly for first-time buyers, and could damp the gains of a housing rebound still in its early stages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices ran up so fast in 2013, it hurt first-timers' ability to become homeowners," said John Burns, chief executive of a home-building consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. "It's going to be a slower recovery than people had hoped because a number of people have been priced out of the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values nationwide are up 11% over the past two years, according to real-estate information service <span class="companylink">Zillow Inc</span>., leaving values around 14% below their 2007 peak. Mortgage rates, which jumped a full percentage point to about 4.5% in the past year, have sharpened worries over housing affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as prices have increased, housing still appears affordable by one traditional gauge. Since 1990, American homeowners have spent about 24% of monthly income on their mortgage payments, according to data from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>. Today, that payment-to-income ratio stands at around 20%, below the long-run average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with that view of affordability: It assumes borrowers have great credit and large down payments. The ratio isn't favorable for first-time buyers and others with lower incomes and smaller down payments, which increases their monthly financing costs. The payment ratio for first-time buyers was around 24% at the end of last year, in line with its long-run average, according to the <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This pinch on first-timers is troubling because, so far, the housing recovery has depended to an unusual degree on cash buyers and investors. The relatively weak position of entry-level buyers could further suppress the homeownership rate -- now off more than four percentage points from its 2004 peak -- as more of them rent, said Vishwanath Tirupattur, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are only part of the problem for first-time buyers. Inventory shortages and tougher mortgage-qualification standards benefit buyers who can make large down payments and those who can forgo a mortgage altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, federal officials have repeatedly increased insurance premiums on loans backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which serves many first-time buyers because it requires down payments of just 3.5%. While mortgage rates at the end of 2013 reached their highest levels in more than two years, the all-in cost of an FHA-backed loan -- due to insurance-premium increases -- was closer to a five-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are less of a problem for current homeowners seeking to trade up because they can tap growing home equity to make their next home purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, higher prices would stimulate more home construction, which would ease inventory crunches that are partly responsible for price increases while boosting job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders have been slow to ramp up production, skittish after being caught with too much inventory when the 2008 downturn hit. Last year, many focused instead on higher-end houses, while entry-level construction was subdued. Sales of new homes last year rose by 14% from 2012, but the number of homes sold for less than $150,000 fell by 28%. Sales above $500,000 grew by 36%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worry is "a situation develops where construction remains low and prices continue to outpace incomes before first-time buyers can get in, and the next thing you know, you have to" bypass standard mortgage-qualification rules "to get people into homes," said Thomas Lawler, an independent housing economist in Leesburg, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others fret that low interest rates have allowed prices to rise too fast relative to incomes, which have stagnated. While homes are still affordable on a monthly payment basis because of cheap financing, homes no longer look like a bargain when comparing prices to incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few years, policy makers have focused on breaking a vicious downdraft in home prices. Now, it wouldn't hurt housing to see price gains flatten out, especially if income growth remains tepid. If not, the housing market's roller-coaster ride will continue.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON—A growing proportion of Britons expect interest rates to rise in the coming year, according to a Bank of England survey Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The BOE said 40% of Britons polled in February expect the central bank's benchmark interest rate to rise from 0.5% in the next 12 months, up from 37% of those polled in November. The last time the proportion expecting a rise was higher was in May 2012, when 41% were anticipating a rate hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found the proportion of Britons expecting rates to stay the same over the next 12 months fell in February to 37% from 43% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings suggest British households' expectations of future changes in interest rates are moving closer to expectations in financial markets, where futures contracts suggest investors believe the BOE will begin tightening policy in the first half of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey found 50% of Britons expect the BOE's benchmark rate to be between 0% and 1% in 12 months' time. Officials have indicated future increases in the benchmark rate will be slow and limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pollsters GfK NOP interviewed 3,949 Britons in early February to compile the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll found Britons' expectations of future inflation declined in February. Respondents said they expect annual inflation of 2.8% over the next year, the lowest figure since May 2010, and 3.2% in five years' time. The BOE's target is 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Respondents were also asked about house prices. Rapidly rising real-estate prices are stoking fears the U.K. may be facing a housing boom. Just under a third of Britons polled said they expect prices to rise between 0% and 5% in the coming year. In London and the southeast of England, where price gains have been quickest, 27% said they expect prices to rise between 5% and 10%. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Nancy Keates   </div><div>1361 words</div><div>7 March 2014</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas these days, the high-rollers may be the ones saving the most cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Shelton, a real-estate investor representing an investment company, recently paid $2.8 million at auction for a 5-acre gated estate with seven bedrooms, a lagoon-style pool and a car museum in Tomiyasu Estates, about 10 minutes from the Strip. The estate last sold for $4 million in 2010. "The timing was right," says Mr. Shelton, who also snapped up another investment, a 17,000-square-foot equestrian estate on 11 acres in the Paradise Enterprise neighborhood for $1.25 million. The seller paid $3.75 million for that property a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high end of the Vegas housing market, homes are going fast. Sales of homes priced over $1 million almost doubled to 342 in 2013, compared with a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors</span>. But while overall home prices in Las Vegas have risen over the past year, prices in the luxury slice of the market have struggled. The median price for homes over $1 million was virtually unchanged last year from the same level it has hovered at for the past five years -- around $1.4 million. The result: Buyers from pricier metro areas, like Los Angeles, are finding some steep discounts on luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Steve Aoki, a Grammy-nominated record producer and the founder of Dim Mak Records, bought a four-bedroom home in Summerlin, a gated golf-course community northwest of the city. At 15,600 square feet, the house is big enough for a music studio and a gym that has pits filled with giant foam cubes. The price: $2.8 million, $200,000 off the listing price. "The value was just insane," says Mr. Aoki, who is moving from a 3,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative discounts at the high end are a contrast to the overall Las Vegas housing market, which has been bouncing back after a steep decline. Last year, Vegas home prices were up 35.5% over the previous year -- more than in any of the other 20 cities tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price index. Much of the gain occurred because many foreclosures finally started selling. In 2013 some 62% of home sales were "traditional sales" -- not foreclosures or short sales -- compared with just 37% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the darkest days of the Las Vegas housing bust, most luxury homeowners sat on their homes, waiting for the market to improve. Now, real-estate agents say, they are returning to the market en masse, sensing a window of opportunity. And many are looking to sell quickly, having been spooked by the last downturn -- which means they are willing to negotiate on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The higher-end homes have lagged in appreciation and people feel the timing may now be right to sell," says Dale Thornburgh of Synergy Sotheby's International Realty, who organized the auction where Mr. Shelton picked up his homes. At that same auction, a 3,905-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouse in The Palms Place Resort next to the Strip sold for $1.8 million to Texas banker Robert Marling. It was listed for $2.2 million. The seller was an investor named Lacy Harber, a Texas businessman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the biggest deals are in fairly new, upscale gated communities in the city's suburbs. These developments, which feature amenities such as golf courses, country clubs, parks and shops, were largely built during Las Vegas's superheated run-up in the mid-2000s. Some homeowners who bought in these developments -- which became emblems of the market's boom and subsequent bust -- are now eager to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cecilia and Lawrence Ventimiglia, luxury-home builders, bought their lot for $800,000 in 2006 and built an 8,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, 5 1/2-bath custom house on almost half an acre in the Ridges in Summerlin, a gated country-club development. When the market tanked, and similar lots in the same neighborhood were selling for half what they paid, they decided to stay in the house because they had too much money in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when they got a lot of lowball offers, they didn't sell. When the market started to improve last year, they decided to list it for $3.4 million -- and sold it for $3 million to Michael Mossholder, head of Global Marketing Partnerships at Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed-martial-arts promotion company. Though they said it meant a loss for them -- they won't say how much -- the couple said they decided to sell to Mr. Mossholder because they liked him and they were concerned that homes built more cheaply in their neighborhood during the downturn might erode the value of their home further if they waited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mossholder, who had been renting, had been looking for a new house for three years. "I wanted to be in this development, but people weren't selling" he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new luxury buyers in town hail from the same place: California. "Half my buyers last year came from California," says Zar Zanganeh, with LUXE Estates Collection. Last year 13.8% of all homes sold for $1 million or more in the Las Vegas area went to buyers from California. New York, in second place for out-of-state buyers, accounted for 1.4% of all $1-million-plus sales, according to San Diego-based DataQuick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These buyers are attracted to Vegas's low prices -- and Nevada's low taxes. Many Californians have arrived in the wake of Proposition 30. Passed at the end of 2012, the measure hiked personal income and sales taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, Joann and Vic Alfonso sold the home they'd owned in Palm Springs, Calif., for over two decades and moved to Las Vegas, purchasing an 8,500-square-foot, almost-new Mediterranean-style home in a guarded, gated country club community for $2 million. The "state of California is taxed to the limits and its economy isn't in good standing," says Ms. Alfonso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who also later sold their home in Portland, Ore., "couldn't believe how much house" they were getting, adds Ms. Alfonso, who estimates a similar home in a similar neighborhood in Palm Springs would have cost three times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ken Wolt, the move to Las Vegas was more about lifestyle than tax relief. The former head of a radiobroadcast group who acts in commercials and theater and does voice-overs, he was tired of the stress of Los Angeles (traffic, bad roads) and wanted a house big enough for a recording studio. He bought a partially finished, 6,500-square-foot house plus a guesthouse in 2010 for $1 million in a gated community and put about $200,000 into renovations. At first he was worried he'd miss the culture in Los Angeles, but he says he has found plenty of entertainment in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, Las Vegas has started to more closely resemble Southern California. There are now more suburban gated communities with upscale shops. The once-grungy downtown is being revitalized. "Ten years ago people thought of Vegas as the Strip. Now a lot of people don't go to the Strip anymore," says Florence Shapiro, of real-estate firm Shapiro &amp; Sher Group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas these days, the high-rollers may be the ones saving the most cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Shelton, a real-estate investor representing an investment company, recently paid $2.8 million at auction for a 5-acre gated estate with seven bedrooms, a lagoon-style pool and a car museum in Tomiyasu Estates, about 10 minutes from the Strip. The estate last sold for $4 million in 2010. "The timing was right," says Mr. Shelton, who also snapped up another investment, a 17,000-square-foot equestrian estate on 11 acres in the Paradise Enterprise neighborhood for $1.25 million. The seller paid $3.75 million for that property a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high end of the Vegas housing market, homes are going fast. Sales of homes priced over $1 million almost doubled to 342 in 2013, compared with a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors</span>. But while overall home prices in Las Vegas have risen over the past year, prices in the luxury slice of the market have struggled. The median price for homes over $1 million was virtually unchanged last year from the same level it has hovered at for the past five years—around $1.4 million. The result: Buyers from pricier metro areas, like Los Angeles, are finding some steep discounts on luxury homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Steve Aoki, a Grammy-nominated record producer and the founder of Dim Mak Records, bought a four-bedroom home in Summerlin, a gated golf-course community northwest of the city. At 15,600 square feet, the house is big enough for a music studio and a gym that has pits filled with giant foam cubes. The price: $2.8 million, $200,000 off the listing price. "The value was just insane," says Mr. Aoki, who is moving from a 3,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relative discounts at the high end are a contrast to the overall Las Vegas housing market, which has been bouncing back after a steep decline. Last year, Vegas home prices were up 35.5% over the previous year—more than in any of the other 20 cities tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller price index. Much of the gain occurred because many foreclosures finally started selling. In 2013 some 62% of home sales were "traditional sales"—not foreclosures or short sales—compared with just 37% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the darkest days of the Las Vegas housing bust, most luxury homeowners sat on their homes, waiting for the market to improve. Now, real-estate agents say, they are returning to the market en masse, sensing a window of opportunity. And many are looking to sell quickly, having been spooked by the last downturn—which means they are willing to negotiate on price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The higher-end homes have lagged in appreciation and people feel the timing may now be right to sell," says Dale Thornburgh of Synergy Sotheby's International Realty, who organized the auction where Mr. Shelton picked up his homes. At that same auction, a 3,905-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouse in The Palms Place Resort next to the Strip sold for $1.8 million to Texas banker Robert Marling. It was listed for $2.2 million. The seller was an investor named Lacy Harber, a Texas businessman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the biggest deals are in fairly new, upscale gated communities in the city's suburbs. These developments, which feature amenities such as golf courses, country clubs, parks and shops, were largely built during Las Vegas's superheated run-up in the mid-2000s. Some homeowners who bought in these developments—which became emblems of the market's boom and subsequent bust—are now eager to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cecilia and Lawrence Ventimiglia, luxury-home builders, bought their lot for $800,000 in 2006 and built an 8,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, 5½-bath custom house on almost half an acre in the Ridges in Summerlin, a gated country-club development. When the market tanked, and similar lots in the same neighborhood were selling for half what they paid, they decided to stay in the house because they had too much money in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when they got a lot of lowball offers, they didn't sell. When the market started to improve last year, they decided to list it for $3.4 million—and sold it for $3 million to Michael Mossholder, head of Global Marketing Partnerships at Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed-martial-arts promotion company. Though they said it meant a loss for them—they won't say how much—the couple said they decided to sell to Mr. Mossholder because they liked him and they were concerned that homes built more cheaply in their neighborhood during the downturn might erode the value of their home further if they waited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mossholder, who had been renting, had been looking for a new house for three years. "I wanted to be in this development, but people weren't selling" he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new luxury buyers in town hail from the same place: California. "Half my buyers last year came from California," says Zar Zanganeh, with LUXE Estates Collection. Last year 13.8% of all homes sold for $1 million or more in the Las Vegas area went to buyers from California. New York, in second place for out-of-state buyers, accounted for 1.4% of all $1-million-plus sales, according to San Diego-based DataQuick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These buyers are attracted to Vegas's low prices—and Nevada's low taxes. Many Californians have arrived in the wake of Proposition 30. Passed at the end of 2012, the measure hiked personal income and sales taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, Joann and Vic Alfonso sold the home they'd owned in Palm Springs, Calif., for over two decades and moved to Las Vegas, purchasing an 8,500-square-foot, almost-new Mediterranean-style home in a guarded, gated country club community for $2 million. The "state of California is taxed to the limits and its economy isn't in good standing," says Ms. Alfonso.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who also later sold their home in Portland, Ore., "couldn't believe how much house" they were getting, adds Ms. Alfonso, who estimates a similar home in a similar neighborhood in Palm Springs would have cost three times as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ken Wolt, the move to Las Vegas was more about lifestyle than tax relief. The former head of a radiobroadcast group who acts in commercials and theater and does voice-overs, he was tired of the stress of Los Angeles (traffic, bad roads) and wanted a house big enough for a recording studio. He bought a partially finished, 6,500-square-foot house plus a guesthouse in 2010 for $1 million in a gated community and put about $200,000 into renovations. At first he was worried he'd miss the culture in Los Angeles, but he says he has found plenty of entertainment in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, Las Vegas has started to more closely resemble Southern California. There are now more suburban gated communities with upscale shops. The once-grungy downtown is being revitalized. "Ten years ago people thought of Vegas as the Strip. Now a lot of people don't go to the Strip anymore," says Florence Shapiro, of real-estate firm Shapiro &amp; Sher Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even celebrities are trading up: Last May, musician Carlos Santana bought a house for $6 million in Summerlin. Last month, he sold his 7,200-square-foot contemporary down the street for $2.9 million. He had bought it in 2011 for $3.5 million. His new pad is 7,800 square feet and, according to the listing, has a $400,000 state-of-the-art movie theater, a game room, a gym, a putting green and an infinity pool.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG—<span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>., the nation's largest property developer by revenue, said Thursday 2013 net profit rose 21% as strong demand for homes buoyed earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 rose to 15.12 billion yuan ($2.42 billion) from 12.55 billion yuan a year earlier, said Vanke, which is a bellwether for the residential market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue rose 32% on year to 127.45 billion yuan, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenzhen-based Vanke said in early January that contracted sales last year rose 21%, buoyed by stronger-than-expected housing demand in major Chinese cities. Contracted sales are an indication of what sales could be like months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of floor space, Vanke's sales totaled 14.9 million square meters, up 15% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property sales in China grew faster than expected in 2013, as easier credit conditions and expectations that property prices would rise compelled buyers to rush into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To contain runaway prices, Beijing has since early 2010 implemented curbs on second-home purchases and squeezed credit to developers amid concerns that unaffordable homes could threaten the economy and social stability. But the curbs were arbitrarily enforced and prices have continued to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall sales in China are likely to moderate from 2013's jump, with the oversupply of homes in tier two and smaller cities dragging on price growth, analysts said. Property developers in cities such as Changzhou and Hangzhou have started to cut prices for new homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate agents, rejoice. The rich are getting richer and more confident, and there is nothing they like more than buying fancy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data from a global study of "ultra-high-net-worth individuals"—the top 0.01%—shows a stark rise in house prices in the most desirable parts of cities across the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, by real-estate broker Knight Frank, looked at the lifestyles of the superrich—those with more than $30 million in net assets—and the very expensive penthouses, castles, mansions and estates they buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in prime locations rose last year in 54 of the 90 cities surveyed by Knight Frank. That's a greater proportion of gainers than in the prior year's survey, when half the cities showed rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggest that the rich are spreading their wings, after years of retreating to a relatively small number of stable cities. When the banking crisis kicked off in 2008, a "big wave of money" flocked to investing in cities like London, New York, Sydney, and Vancouver, said Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at Knight Frank in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wave is spreading out. Six of the 10 cities with the biggest average price gains in Knight Frank's Prime International Residential Index were in the Asian-Pacific region this year. Jakarta, Indonesia, was on top with a 38% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles was the only North American city in the top 15, posting a 14% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Europe continued to slump—the region lost 1% and contributed to 80% of all locations where prices declined last year —there were signs of recovery. Dublin captured the fifth spot on the index with a 17% gain, and Madrid posted an increase of 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ranks of the superrich appear to be growing. The study estimates that there were around 168,000 people who met the $30 million threshold last year, close to 5,000 more than in 2012. Their wealth totaled $20.1 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they like property. Houses account for 30% of their combined wealth. On average, each of the superrich has 2.4 homes, the survey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for mansions and penthouses across the world spread out from traditional havens like London and New York last year. While caution among the superrich—invoked by the half-decade-long financial crisis—continued to ease, their money continued to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alongside the uptick in wealth creation, confidence in the economic recovery lead investors to branch out from traditional havens, especially benefiting Asia. But not all markets in the region were strong. In Singapore and Hong Kong, governments moved to cool superhot markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending regulation in Singapore and a stricter tax regime in Hong Kong "really slowed the markets down" in 2013, said Nicholas Holt, head of research, Asia-Pacific, at Knight Frank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the havens haven't lost their luster. Despite not showing huge price growth at the upper reaches, Monaco, Hong Kong, London, Singapore, Geneva and New York remain among the world's highest-priced luxury-home markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those cities, homes in the most desirable districts are phenomenally expensive. In Monaco's top-tier residences, $1 million buys enough square footage for a bathroom. In London, it fetches a large dining room. For New York, it's a large reception room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You might think that if risk appetite has returned, it would undermine the safe haven story," Mr. Bailey said. "But no. Those prices are still rising."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- <span class="companylink">China Vanke Co</span>. said it received long-awaited regulatory approval to convert its Shenzhen-listed B shares to Hong Kong-listed H shares, likely becoming the third Chinese company to successfully transfer its listing to the more-active Hong Kong market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property developer, China's largest in terms of revenue, said in a statement to the <span class="companylink">Shenzhen Stock Exchange</span> Monday that it had received approval from the <span class="companylink">China Securities Regulatory Commission</span>. It announced plans to convert its Hong Kong dollar-denominated B-shares to the Hong Kong exchange in January 2013, as it kicked off expansion plans offshore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">B shares are stock listed in China, generally denominated in foreign currency, and open to investment by non-Chinese. This is in contrast to A shares, which are denominated in yuan and are generally open to purchase only by mainland Chinese investors. H shares are the Hong Kong stock of mainland companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">China Vanke</span>'s A shares will continue to be traded on the mainland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The B-share conversion could enhance Vanke's name globally and help the company tap a bigger pool of investors for future capital-raising efforts, Vanke's board secretary, Tan Huajie, said when the conversion plan was unveiled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Will it excite the market? Yes, but it's not enough," Eva Lee, a property analyst at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, said of the approval. "Investors are now more concerned about macroeconomic fundamentals in the property market. <span class="companylink">China Vanke</span> still had to wait a long time, which indicates that the Chinese authorities are still very cautious about giving companies another channel for liquidity," or capital raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's property market has recently started to show signs of cooling, with developers in many cities starting to offer discounts on new homes amid concerns about oversupply and tightened credit. According to China Real Estate Index System, a data provider, average new-home prices rose 10.79% in February from a year earlier, compared with 11.1% in January. The rate of increase in December was 11.5%. The survey tracks new-home sales in 100 Chinese cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said it remains to be seen whether the approval results in a torrent of similar migrations among other Chinese firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China imposed a moratorium on new listings in 2012, and has only recently reopened its initial-public-offering market. <span class="companylink">China International Marine Containers</span> was the first company to successfully convert its B shares into H shares in December 2012, followed by <span class="companylink">Livzon Pharmaceutical Group</span> last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers familiar with Vanke's B-share-to-H-share proposal said last year that the securities regulator had withheld approval on such conversions. Chinese companies have been looking to shift their listings from the illiquid B-share market, which was once a popular destination for foreign investors seeking to buy Chinese equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its B shares and yuan-denominated A shares, Vanke has a Hong Kong-listed unit called Vanke Property (Overseas).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has invested in development projects in the U.S., Singapore and Hong Kong since the start of 2013. Last week, the Shenzhen-based developer said it made its second investment in the U.S. It will build a 61-story residential tower in New York City jointly with U.S. developers RFR Holdings and Hines.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Madison Ave. Co-op</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the rising value of retail real estate in Manhattan, a modest-sized retail co-op on the Upper East Side has sold for $123.8 million, or more than $31,000 a square foot, one of the highest prices ever recorded for a shop property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An affiliate of fashion house <span class="companylink">Chanel SA</span> bought the 3,950-square-foot space, on the ground floor of a residential co-op building at 733-739 Madison Ave., at the corner of 64th Street; in the shop now is a Chanel Fine Jewelry boutique, said Aaron Shmulewitz, a partner at Belkin Burden Wenig &amp; Goldman, which represents the building's co-op board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller was Louis and Anne Abrons Foundation Inc., a philanthropy known chiefly for sponsoring arts programming at Henry Street Settlement on the Lower East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody was shocked by this price," Mr. Shmulewitz said. "The foundation did very well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, Chanel will pay $18,000 a month in maintenance fees to the board, and the board received more than $4 million in transaction fees from the sale, Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chanel declined to comment; representatives for the foundation did not return calls for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, the highest per-square-foot price paid for a retail property was $15.409 in October 2012, when <span class="companylink">Richemont North America Inc</span>. bought the space at the St. Regis Hotel on East 55th Street, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a commercial brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking rents on Madison Avenue from 57th to 72nd Streets have risen steadily over the last year, from $1,093 in the fourth quarter of 2012, to $1,356 at the end of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Luxury retailers still want to be on Madison Avenue, because you know your client is going to be there," said Gene Spiegelman, a vice chairman with Cushman.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Massey Knakal's new hotel sales division bagged its first big loan, helping a Chinese investor refinance its debt on property near Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerage firm lent $80 million to HNA Property Holdings, a subsidiary of a Chinese airline, for the Cassa Hotel at 70 W. 45th St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing-based HNA Property Holdings acquired the hotel for $130 million two years ago, shortly after it opened but before all the rooms were complete and before the restaurant had opened.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pane Stone Construction Inc. has been based in Flushing, Queens, for the past 30 years and is now opening the neighborhood's first luxury boutique hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Parc Hotel is set to open March 10 at 39-16 College Point Blvd., which is just blocks from the Main Street transportation hub and not far from Flushing Town Hall and the Sky View Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of hotels in the neighborhood are all chains of various qualities, and we consider ourselves a higher-end establishment because of the detail and design," said Jimmy Hsu, who operates the building company with his parents and his brother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pane Stone Construction purchased the land for the hotel four years ago; construction on the 13-story, 96-room tower began more than two years ago, Mr. Hsu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction business and two silent investors have spent $12 million to 15 million on the hotel, including the land purchase, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a pretty good understanding of the Flushing neighborhood, it's very culture-driven," said Mr. Hsu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pane Stone Construction also owns several other venues in Flushing, including Minni's Shabu Shabu, a restaurant, and the Zebra Lounge and the Zebra Lounge 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Parc Hotel will have five types of rooms, with the cheapest from $129 to $189 a night and the most expensive from $279 to $339 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel will have two restaurants, a rooftop bar and a lounge opening in spring, a dog spa, a gym, a business center and a meeting room; guests also can take a shuttle to and from La Guardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lang Architecture opted for a modern design to make the hotel broadly appealing, said architect Drew Lang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flushing has a large Asian population and many of its hotels have a Chinese theme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of glass in the rooms, windows floor to ceiling, so even the smallest rooms feel large," Mr. Lang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we paid most attention to is the facade, and we spent a lot of time sourcing grey limestone from Spain. We wanted to use a natural stone material to give the building a strong presence and allow it to weather over time -- we imagine it will be there for a long period of time, not just be fleeting."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tos Chirathivat, 50 years old, became chief executive of Thailand's sprawling family-owned retail and real estate conglomerate Central Group in November as antigovernment protesters took to the streets, shaking the political and economic stability of the Southeast Asian nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $7 billion retail empire, run by Thailand's second-wealthiest family, is the country's leading operator of department stores and supermarkets. Central Group gets about 90% of its revenue from its home market, but has grand ambitions for expansion in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its Central Retail arm acquired Danish department store Illum last year and Italian department store La Rinascente in 2011. In 2013, Central Group's sales rose 19% to 234 billion baht ($7.18 billion), with its hotel and retail businesses expanding most rapidly. The group—whose <span class="companylink">Central Pattana PCL</span> retail development arm and <span class="companylink">Central Plaza Hotel PCL</span> division trade on Thailand's stock exchange—is targeting 2014 sales growth of 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos, the grandson of company founder Tiang Chirathivat, recently spoke to The Wall Street Journal about Thailand's history of political strife, the difficulties of bringing his brand overseas and why the company doesn't need to be the world's number one retailer. Edited excerpts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How does it feel taking the helm of Central Group at such a turbulent time for Thailand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: Our country has been through this many, many times. This round is less violent, but it could last longer. What is important is that Thailand is growing up democratically. People come from all walks of life. They have expressed their views clearly. Future leaders will have to listen to the people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm the head of the company, but we are a big family business. It's not like everything is on my shoulder. I have a lot of people to support me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: How is the political unrest affecting business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: We have not closed any stores since November. Obviously, at the sites that are close to the protests, business is soft. The prolonged situation may affect the mood of the people and their spending. But business is still at acceptable levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What is your vision for Central Group?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: We are in the service industry, whether it's retail or real estate. Our goal is to be the leader in the service industry in Thailand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focus for us is on quality of assets, quality of offices. Our hotel group Centara is now number one in the country and expanding very quickly. Our aim is to be in each city and to develop all these services and become the center of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Do you expect to make more acquisitions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: Acquisitions are now a main part of our business. Everyone in the company has signed on to the idea. A company of our size really needs to grow, and if you grow organically, 10% or 12% would be pushing it. If you wish to grow at least 15% a year, acquisitions have to be part of the strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What is your war chest for acquisitions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: The overall investment plan for our group is 40 to 50 billion baht per year. It's hard to separate out how much will go to acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: You've said that Europe and Southeast Asia are priorities for expansion. Can you be a strong player in both regions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: I don't think it's important for us to be the biggest in the world. Whether we are number one or number two, it's not important. We want to be profitable. We want to grow continuously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness of conglomerates is that they don't compete well with specialists. We have reorganized into eight business groups, so each group will grow more easily. By reorganizing, we want the groups to be more specialized. If you analyze our company, that's how we became successful in Thailand. Even if it's eight groups, they're all related and integrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before, you might see the business groups setting up their own offices in different countries. Now, we sit down together and go into a country together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: You've expressed interest in acquisitions in Indonesia. Any particular assets you have in mind?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: Acquisitions are very sensitive, so it's hard to discuss. But in a country like Indonesia, with a lot of competition, it's impossible to start up an operation. It would have to be through acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: What is the challenge for Central Group as it expands overseas?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: So far, we have been in two places overseas. One is China, one is Europe. We are not doing well in China, and in Europe, we are doing well. Starting an operation in a foreign country is very difficult. The key is to make the right acquisition. You also need to have very good country managers and full support from the head office, otherwise it will be very difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WSJ: Why is China challenging?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tos: In the department store industry, no one is doing well in China. There are too many players, too many stores. China's slowdown also has an effect. The government crackdown on official spending and gifts, that directly hurts retailers. Consumers are also more cautious with spending. We've been in China for five years, and we're not yet turning a profit. Hopefully, that will [change] in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Education: Bachelor's Degree in Economics, <span class="companylink">Wesleyan University</span>, 1985; Master's Degree in Business Administration, <span class="companylink">Columbia University</span>, 1987.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Career:Before joining the family business, Mr. Tos worked as an investment banker in Bangkok for Citibank. In 1989, he joined Central Pattana, the shopping mall development arm of Central Group. In his more than two decades with the family business, he has served as chief executive officer of Big C Supercenter, a hypermarket chain, and in various roles at Central Retail Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family: Wife Sukta Chirathivat, has two children.</p>

</div><div>620 words</div><div>1 March 2014</div><div>15:26</div><div>The Wall Street Journal Online</div><div>WSJO</div><div>WSJ.com</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices last year posted their largest annual gain since 2005, according to the widely watched S&amp;P/Case-Shiller price index, amid a frenzy of sales, low mortgage rates and reduced inventories during the year's first half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose a year-over-year 11.3% in the fourth quarter, the index showed. A subindex measuring prices in 20 major metro areas rose 13.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are signs that price gains will soon moderate. "Gains are slowing from month to month, and the strongest part of the recovery in home values may be over," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a report by the Demand Institute projected home prices in 2,200 towns and cities surveyed will rise by 2.1% annually between 2015 and 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains will vary sharply by location. The report found that the wealthiest 10% of cities accounted for 52% of the country's total housing wealth, while the poorest 40% held just 8%. Since 2000, the value of housing for the top decile rose 73%—around $2 trillion in nominal dollars—while the bottom 40% rose by 59%, or $260 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After falling nearly 35% between 2006 and 2012, home prices have risen 21% since hitting a bottom in early 2012. The price indexes have returned to 2004 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal authorities are stepping up efforts to stop what they call a growing problem of fraudulent filings seeking tax refunds based on stolen identities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 22, two members of an alleged crack-dealing gang in Miami were indicted on charges they also ran a tax-refund scam. Suspects typically steal lists of names and Social Security numbers, file large numbers of electronic returns claiming refunds, and receive money before officials spot the fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Identity fraud is partly an outgrowth of electronic filing—in many cases fraudsters take advantage of that and of separate <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> measures intended to ease the filing process for people without bank accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the Justice Department said it had filed charges against more than 880 people suspected of stolen-identity tax-refund crimes in the year through Oct. 31. From 2008 through May 2012, the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> identified more than 550,000 taxpayers whose identities were stolen for the purpose of claiming false refunds in their names, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of IRS investigations jumped 66% in the past year. The agency initiated 1,492 probes of identity-theft-related crimes in fiscal 2013, up from 898 in 2012 and 276 in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local and state governments across the country are tapping the brakes on red-light cameras. After a decade of steady growth, the number of communities using cameras to catch drivers who run stoplights has fallen about 6% since 2012, to 508, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit group funded by the automobile-insurance industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven states ban them altogether, says the National Conference of State Legislatures, and several more, including Ohio and Florida, are considering such prohibitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies of whether the cameras, which are typically mounted on fixtures beside the road, improve traffic safety are numerous and contradictory. Still, many locations, including some big cities, have no plans to get rid of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Netflix agreed to pay <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> to ensure Netflix movies and television shows stream smoothly to <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> customers. The landmark pact could set a precedent for Netflix's dealings with other broadband providers.</p>
